<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is already true that Big Data has drawn huge attention from researchers in information sciences, policy and decision makers in governments and enterprises. As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore's Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as dataintensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Big Data has been one of the current and future research frontiers. In this year, Gartner listed the ''Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends For 2013'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[158]</ref> and ''Top 10 Critical Tech Trends For The Next Five Years'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[157]</ref>, and Big Data is listed in the both two. It is right to say that Big Data will revolutionize many fields, including business, the scientific research, public administration, and so on. For the definition of the Big Data, there are various different explanations from 3Vs to 4Vs. Doug Laney used volume, velocity and variety, known as 3Vs <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[96]</ref>, to characterize the concept of Big Data. The term volume is the size of the data set, velocity indicates the speed of data in and out, and variety describes the range of data types and sources. Sometimes, people extend another V according to their special requirements. The fourth V can be value, variability, or virtual <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[207]</ref>. More commonly, Big Data is a collection of very huge data sets with a great diversity of types so that it becomes difficult to process by using state-of-the-art data processing approaches or traditional data processing platforms. In 2012, Gartner retrieved and gave a more detailed definition as: ''Big Data are high-volume, high-velocity, and/or high-variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization''. More generally, a data set can be called Big Data if it is formidable to perform capture, curation, analysis and visualization on it at the current technologies.</p><p>With diversified data provisions, such as sensor networks, telescopes, scientific experiments, and high throughput instruments, the datasets increase at exponential rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[178,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">110]</ref> as demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (source from <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[67]</ref>). The off-the-shelf techniques and technologies that we ready used to store and analyse data cannot work efficiently and satisfactorily. The challenges arise from data capture and data curation to data analysis and data visualization. In many instances, science is legging behind the real world in the capabilities of discovering the valuable knowledge from massive volume of data. Based on precious knowledge, we need to develop and create new techniques and technologies to excavate Big Data and benefit our specified purposes.</p><p>Big Data has changed the way that we adopt in doing businesses, managements and researches. Data-intensive science especially in data-intensive computing is coming into the world that aims to provide the tools that we need to handle the Big Data problems. Data-intensive science <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref> is emerging as the fourth scientific paradigm in terms of the previous three, namely empirical science, theoretical science and computational science. Thousand years ago, scientists describing the natural phenomenon only based on human empirical evidences, so we call the science at that time as empirical science. It is also the beginning of science and classified as the first paradigm. Then, theoretical science emerged hundreds years ago as the second paradigm, such as Newton's Motion Laws and Kepler's Laws. However, in terms of many complex phenomenon and problems, scientists have to turn to scientific simulations, since theoretical analysis is highly complicated and sometimes unavailable and infeasible. Afterwards, the third science paradigm was born as computational branch. Simulations in large of fields generate a huge volume of data from the experimental science, at the same time, more and more large data sets are generated in many pipelines. There is no doubt that the world of science has changed just because of the increasing data-intensive applications. The techniques and technologies for this kind of data-intensive science are totally distinct with the previous three. Therefore, data-intensive science is viewed as a new and fourth science paradigm for scientific discoveries <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[65]</ref>.</p><p>In Section 2, we will discuss several transparent Big Data applications around three fields. The opportunities and challenges aroused from Big Data problems will be introduced in Section 3. Then, we give a detailed demonstration of stateof-the-art techniques and technologies to handle data-intensive applications in Section 4, where Big Data tools discussed there will give a helpful guide for expertise users. In Section 5, a number of principles for designing effective Big Data systems are listed. One of the most important parts of this paper, which provides several underlying techniques to settle Big Data problems, is ranged in Section 6. In the last section, we draw a conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Big Data problems</head><p>As more and more fields involve Big Data problems, ranging from global economy to society administration, and from scientific researches to national security, we have entered the era of Big Data. Recently, a report <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[114]</ref> from McKinsey institute gives transformative potentials of Big Data in five domains: health care of the United States, public sector administration of European Union, retail of the United States, global manufacturing and personal location data. Their research claims that Big Data can make prominent growth of the world economy by enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of enterprises and also the public administrations.</p><p>Big Data has a deep relationship with e-Science <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[66]</ref>, which is computationally intensive science which usually is implemented in distributed computing systems. Many issues on Big Data applications can be resolved by e-Science which require grid computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[80]</ref>. e-Sciences include particle physics, bio-informatics, earth sciences and social simulations. It also provides technologies that enable distributed collaboration, such as the Access Grid. Particle physics has a well-developed e-Science infrastructure in particular because of its need for adequate computing facilities for the analysis of results and storage of data originating from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) Large Hadron Collider, which started taking data in 2009. e-Science is a big concept with many sub-fields, such as e-Social Science which can be regarded as a higher development in e-Science. It plays a role as a part of social science to collect, process, and analyse the social and behavioral data.</p><p>Other Big Data applications lies in many scientific disciplines like astronomy, atmospheric science, medicine, genomics, biologic, biogeochemistry and other complex and interdisciplinary scientific researches. Web-based applications encounter Big Data frequently, such as recent hot spots social computing (including social network analysis, online communities, recommender systems, reputation systems, and prediction markets), Internet text and documents, Internet search indexing. Alternatively, There are countless sensor around us, they generate sumless sensor data that need to be utilized, for instance, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[203]</ref> are based on the analysis of large volumes of complex sensor data. Large-scale e-commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[183]</ref> are particularly data-intensive as it involves large number of customers and transactions. In the following subsections, we will briefly introduce several applications of the Big Data problems in commerce and business, society administration and scientific research fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Big Data in commerce and business</head><p>According to estimates, the volume of business data worldwide, across almost companies, doubles every 1.2 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[114]</ref>. Taking retail industry as an example, we try to give a brief demonstration for the functionalities of Big Data in commercial activities. There are around 267 million transactions per day in Wal-Mart's 6000 stores worldwide. For seeking for higher competitiveness in retail, Wal-Mart recently collaborated with Hewlett Packard to establish a data warehouse which has a capability to store 4 petabytes (see the size of data unit in Appendix A) of data, i.e., 4000 trillion bytes, tracing every purchase record from their point-of-sale terminals. Taking advantage of sophisticated machine learning techniques to exploit the knowledge hidden in this huge volume of data, they successfully improve efficiency of their pricing strategies and advertising campaigns. The management of their inventory and supply chains also significantly benefits from the large-scale warehouse.</p><p>In the era of information, almost every big company encounters Big Data problems, especially for multinational corporations. On the one hand, those companies mostly have a large number of customers around the world. On the other hand, there are very large volume and velocity of their transaction data. For instance, FICO's falcon credit card fraud detection system manages over 2.1 billion valid accounts around the world. There are above 3 billion pieces of content generated on Facebook every day. The same problem happens in every Internet companies. The list could go on and on, as we witness the future businesses battle fields focusing on Big Data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Big Data in society administration</head><p>Public administration also involves Big Data problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[30]</ref>. On one side, the population of one country usually is very large. For another, people in each age level need different public services. For examples, kids and teenagers need more education, the elders require higher level of health care. Every person in one society generates a lot of data in each public section, so the total number of data about public administration in one nation is extremely huge. For instance, there are almost 3 terabytes of data collected by the US Library of Congress by 2011. The Obama administration announced the Big Data research and development initiative in 2012, which investigate addressing important problems facing the government by make use of Big Data. The initiative was constitutive of 84 different Big Data programs involving six departments. 1 The similar thing also happened in Europe. Governments around the world are facing adverse conditions to improve their productivity. Namely, they are required to be more effective in public administration. Particularly in the recent global recession, many governments have to provide a higher level of public services with significant budgetary constraints. Therefore, they should take Big Data as a potential budget resource and develop tools to get alternative solutions to decrease big budget deficits and reduce national debt levels.</p><p>According to McKinsey's report <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[114]</ref>, Big Data functionalities, such as reserving informative patterns and knowledge, provide the public sector a chance to improve productivity and higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness. European's public sector could potentially reduce expenditure of administrative activities by 15-20 percent, increasing 223 billion to 446 billion values, or even more. This estimate is under efficiency gains and a reduction in the difference between actual and 1 http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/03/29/big-data-big-deal. potential aggregate of tax revenue. These functionalities could speed up year productivity growth by up to 0.5 percentage points over the next decade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Big Data in scientific research</head><p>Many scientific fields have already become highly data-driven <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[179,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">31]</ref> with the development of computer sciences. For instance, astronomy, meteorology, social computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[187]</ref>, bioinformatics <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[100]</ref> and computational biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[117]</ref> are greatly based on data-intensive scientific discovery as large volume of data with various types generated or produced in these science fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[45]</ref>. How to probe knowledge from the data produced by large-scale scientific simulation? It is a certain Big Data problem which the answer is still unsatisfiable or unknown.</p><p>For instances, a sophisticated telescope is regarded as a very large digital camera which generate huge number of universal images. For example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will record 30 trillion bytes of image data in a single day. The size of the data equals to two entire Sloan Digital Sky Surveys daily. Astronomers will utilize computing facilities and advanced analysis methods to this data to investigate the origins of the universe. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator that can generate 60 terabytes of data per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[29]</ref>. The patterns in those data can give us an unprecedented understanding the nature of the universe. 32 petabytes of climate observations and simulations were conserved on the discovery supercomputing cluster in the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS). The volume of human genome information is also so large that decoding them originally took a decade to process. Otherwise, a lot of other e-Science projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[66]</ref> are proposed or underway in a wide variety of other research fields, range from environmental science, oceanography and geology to biology and sociology. One common point exists in these disciplines is that they generate enormous data sets that automated analysis is highly required. Additionally, centralized repository is necessary as it is impractical to replicate copies for remote individual research groups. Therefore, centralized storage and analysis approaches drive the whole system designs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Big Data opportunities and challenges</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Opportunities</head><p>Recently, several US government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), ascertain that the utilities of Big Data to data-intensive decision-making have profound influences in their future developments <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Consequently, they are trying to developing Big Data technologies and techniques to facilitate their missions after US government passed a large-scale Big Data initiative. This initiative is very helpful for building new capabilities for exploiting informative knowledge and facilitate decision-makers.</p><p>From the Networking Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program which is recently recognized by President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), we know that the bridges between Big Data and knowledge hidden in it are highly crucial in all areas of national priority. This initiative will also lay the groundwork for complementary Big Data activities, such as Big Data infrastructure projects, platforms development, and techniques in settling complex, data-driven problems in sciences and engineering. Finally, they will be put into practice and benefit society.</p><p>According to the report from McKinsey institute <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[114]</ref>, the effective use of Big Data has the underlying benefits to transform economies, and delivering a new wave of productive growth. Taking advantages of valuable knowledge beyond Big Data will become the basic competition for today's enterprises and will create new competitors who are able to attract employees that have the critical skills on Big Data. Researchers, policy and decision makers have to recognize the potential of harnessing Big Data to uncover the next wave of growth in their fields. There are many advantages in business section that can be obtained through harnessing Big Data as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, including increasing operational efficiency, informing strategic direction, developing better customer service, identifying and developing new products and services, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Big Data Opportunities: above 50% of 560 enterprises think Big Data will help them in increasing operational efficiency, etc.</p><p>identifying new customers and markets, etc. The vertical axis denotes the percentages that how many enterprises think Big Data can help them with respect to specific purposes.</p><p>By liberal estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[114]</ref>, Big Data could produce $300 billion potential annual value to US health care, and €250 billion to European public administration. There will be $600 billion potential annual consumer surplus from using personal location data globally, and give a potential increase with 60%. Only in United States, Big Data produce 140,000 to 190,000 deep analytical talent positions and 1.5 million data-savvy managers. Undoubtedly, Big Data is usually juicy and lucrative if explored correctly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Challenges</head><p>Opportunities are always followed by challenges. On the one hand, Big Data bring many attractive opportunities. On the other hand, we are also facing a lot of challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[137]</ref> when handle Big Data problems, difficulties lie in data capture, storage, searching, sharing, analysis, and visualization. If we cannot surmount those challenges, Big Data will become a gold ore but we do not have the capabilities to explore it, especially when information surpass our capability to harness. One challenge is existing in computer architecture for several decades, that is, CPU-heavy but I/O-poor <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[65]</ref>. This system imbalance still restraint the development of the discovery from Big Data.</p><p>The CPU performance is doubling each 18 months following the Moore's Law, and the performance of disk drives is also doubling at the same rate. However, the disks' rotational speed has slightly improved over the last decade. The consequence of this imbalance is that random I/O speeds have improved moderately while sequential I/O speeds increase with density slowly. Moreover, information is increasing at exponential rate simultaneously, but the improvement of information processing methods is also relatively slower. In a lot of important Big Data applications, the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies cannot ideally solve the real problems, especially for real-time analysis. So partially speaking, until now, we do not have the proper tools to exploit the gold ores completely.</p><p>Typically, the analysis process is shown In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, where the knowledge is discovered in data mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[59]</ref>. Challenges in Big Data analysis include data inconsistence and incompleteness, scalability, timeliness and data security <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">92]</ref>. As the prior step to data analysis, data must be well-constructed. However, considering variety of data sets in Big Data problems, it is still a big challenge for us to purpose efficient representation, access, and analysis of unstructured or semi-structured data in the further researches. How can the data be preprocessed in order to improve the quality data and the analysis results before we begin data analysis? As the sizes of data set are often very huge, sometimes several gigabytes or more, and their origin from heterogeneous sources, current real-world databases are severely susceptible to inconsistent, incomplete, and noisy data. Therefore, a number of data preprocessing techniques, including data cleaning, data integration, data transformation and date reduction, can be applied to remove noise and correct inconsistencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[59]</ref>. Different challenges arise in each sub-process when it comes to data-driven applications. In the following subsections, we will give a brief discussion about challenges we are facing for each sub-process. Data sets grow in size because they are increasingly being gathered by ubiquitous information-sensing mobile devices, aerial sensory technologies, remote sensing, software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification readers, wireless sensor networks, and so on. There are 2:5 quintillion bytes of data created every day, and this number keeps increasing exponentially <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[67]</ref>. The world's technological capacity to store information has roughly doubled about every 3 years since the 1980s. In many fields, like financial and medical data often be deleted just because there is no enough space to store these data. These valuable data are created and captured at high cost, but ignored finally. The bulk storage requirements for experimental data bases, array storage for large-scale scientific computations, and large output files are reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[194]</ref>.</p><p>Big Data has changed the way we capture and store data <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[133]</ref>, including data storage device, data storage architecture, data access mechanism. As we require more storage mediums and higher I/O speed to meet the challenges, there is no doubt that we need great innovations. Firstly, the accessibility of Big Data is on the top priority of the knowledge discovery process. Big Data should be accessed easily and promptly for further analysis, fully or partially break the restraint: CPU-heavy but I/O-poor. In addition, the under-developing storage technologies, such as solid-state drive (SSD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[73]</ref> and phase-change memory (PCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[144]</ref>, may help us alleviate the difficulties, but they are far from enough. One significant shift is also underway, that is the transformative change of the traditional I/O subsystems. In the past decades, the persistent data were stored by using hard disk drives (HDDs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[87]</ref>. As we known, HDDs had much slower random I/O performance than sequential I/O performance, and data processing engines formatted their data and designed their query processing methods to work around this limitation. But, HDDs are increasingly being replaced by SSDs today, and other technologies such as PCM are also around the corner <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[8]</ref>. These current storage technologies cannot possess the same high performance for both the sequential and random I/O simultaneously, which requires us to rethink how to design storage subsystems for Big Data processing systems.</p><p>Direct-attached storage (DAS), network-attached storage (NAS), and storage area network (SAN) are the enterprise storage architectures that were commonly used <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[99]</ref>. However, all these existing storage architectures have severe drawbacks and limitations when it comes to large-scale distributed systems. Aggressive concurrency and per server throughput are the essential requirements for the applications on highly scalable computing clusters, and today's storage systems lack the both. Optimizing data access is a popular way to improve the performance of data-intensive computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">79]</ref>, these techniques include data replication, migration, distribution, and access parallelism. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>, the performance, reliability and scalability in data-access platforms were discussed. Data-access platforms, such as CASTOR, dCache, GPFS and Scalla/Xrootd, are employed to demonstrate the large scale validation and performance measurement. Data storage and search schemes also lead to high overhead and latency <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[162]</ref>, distributed data-centric storage is a good approach in large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Shen, Zhao and Li proposed a distributed spatial-temporal similarity data storage scheme to provide efficient spatial-temporal and similarity data searching service in WSNs. The collective behavior of individuals that cooperate in a swarm provide approach to achieve self-organization in distributed systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">184]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Data transmission</head><p>Cloud data storage is popularly used as the development of cloud technologies. We know that the network bandwidth capacity is the bottleneck in cloud and distributed systems, especially when the volume of communication is large. On the other side, cloud storage also lead to data security problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[190]</ref> as the requirements of data integrity checking. Many schemes were proposed under different systems and security models <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[189,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">134]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Data curation</head><p>Data curation is aimed at data discovery and retrieval, data quality assurance, value addition, reuse and preservation over time. This field specifically involves a number of sub-fields including authentication, archiving, management, preservation, retrieval, and representation. The existing database management tools are unable to process Big Data that grow so large and complex. This situation will continue as the benefits of exploiting Big Data allowing researchers to analyse business trends, prevent diseases, and combat crime. Though the size of Big Data keeps increasing exponentially, current capability to work with is only in the relatively lower levels of petabytes, exabytes and zettabytes of data. The classical approach of managing structured data includes two parts, one is a schema to storage the data set, and another is a relational database for data retrieval. For managing large-scale datasets in a structured way, data warehouses and data marts are two popular approaches. A data warehouse is a relational database system that is used to store and analyze data, also report the results to users. The data mart is based on a data warehouse and facilitate the access and analysis of the data warehouse. A data warehouse is mainly responsible to store data that is sourced from the operational systems. The preprocessing of the data is necessary before it is stored, such as data cleaning, transformation and cataloguing. After these preprocessing, the data is available for higher level online data mining functions. The data warehouse and marts are Standard Query Language (SQL) based databases systems.</p><p>NoSQL database <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[60]</ref>, also called ''Not Only SQL'', is a current approach for large and distributed data management and database design. Its name easily leads to misunderstanding that NoSQL means ''not SQL''. On the contrary, NoSQL does not avoid SQL. While it is true that some NoSQL systems are entirely non-relational, others simply avoid selected relational functionality such as fixed table schemas and join operations. The mainstream Big Data platforms adopt NoSQL to break and transcend the rigidity of normalized RDBMS schemas. For instance, Hbase is one of the most famous used NoSQL databases (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). However, many Big Data analytic platforms, like SQLstream and Cloudera Impala, series still use SQL in its database systems, because SQL is more reliable and simpler query language with high performance in stream Big Data real-time analytics.</p><p>To store and manage unstructured data or non-relational data, NoSQL employs a number of specific approaches. Firstly, data storage and management are separated into two independent parts. This is contrary to relational databases which try to meet the concerns in the two sides simultaneously. This design gives NoSQL databases systems a lot of advantages. In the storage part which is also called key-value storage, NoSQL focuses on the scalability of data storage with high-performance. In the management part, NoSQL provides low-level access mechanism in which data management tasks can be implemented in the application layer rather than having data management logic spread across in SQL or DB-specific stored procedure languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[37]</ref>. Therefore, NoSQL systems are very flexible for data modeling, and easy to update application developments and deployments <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[60]</ref>.</p><p>Most NoSQL databases have an important property. Namely, they are commonly schema-free. Indeed, the biggest advantage of schema-free databases is that it enables applications to quickly modify the structure of data and does not need to rewrite tables. Additionally, it possesses greater flexibility when the structured data is heterogeneously stored. In the data management layer, the data is enforced to be integrated and valid. The most popular NoSQL database is Apache Cassandra. Cassandra, which was once Facebook proprietary database, was released as open source in 2008. Other NoSQL implementations include SimpleDB, Google BigTable, Apache Hadoop, MapReduce, MemcacheDB, and Voldemort. Companies that use NoSQL include Twitter, LinkedIn and NetFlix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.">Data analysis</head><p>The first impression of Big Data is its volume, so the biggest and most important challenge is scalability when we deal with the Big Data analysis tasks. In the last few decades, researchers paid more attentions to accelerate analysis algorithms to cope with increasing volumes of data and speed up processors following the Moore's Law. For the former, it is necessary to develop sampling, on-line, and multiresolution analysis methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[59]</ref>. In the aspect of Big Data analytical techniques, increment algorithms have good scalability property, not for all machine learning algorithms. Some researchers devote into this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[180,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">62]</ref>. As the data size is scaling much faster than CPU speeds, there is a natural dramatic shift <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[8]</ref> in processor technology-although the clock cycle frequency of processors is doubling following Moore's Law, the clock speeds still highly lag behind. Alternatively, processors are being embedded with increasing numbers of cores. This shift in processors leads to the development of parallel computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[130,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">52]</ref>.</p><p>For those real-time Big Data applications, like navigation, social networks, finance, biomedicine, astronomy, intelligent transport systems, and internet of thing, timeliness is at the top priority. How can we grantee the timeliness of response when the volume of data will be processed is very large? It is still a big challenge for stream processing involved by Big Data. It is right to say that Big Data not only have produced many challenge and changed the directions of the development of the hardware, but also in software architectures. That is the swerve to cloud computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">186,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">48]</ref>, which aggregates multiple disparate workloads into a large cluster of processors. In this direction, distributed computing is being developed at high speed recently. We will give a more detail discussion about it in next section. Data security surfaces with great attentions. Significant security problems include data security protection, intellectual property protection, personal privacy protection, commercial secrets and financial information protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[172]</ref>. Most developed and developing countries have already made related data protection laws to enhance the security. Research groups and individuals need to carefully consider the legislation of where they store and process data to make sure that they are in compliance with the regulations. For Big Data related applications, data security problems are more awkward for several reasons. Firstly, the size of Big Data is extremely large, channelling the protection approaches. Secondly, it also leads to much heavier workload of the security. Otherwise, most Big Data are stored in a distributed way, and the threats from networks also can aggravate the problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5.">Data visualization</head><p>The main objective of data visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[169,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">88]</ref> is to represent knowledge more intuitively and effectively by using different graphs. To convey information easily by providing knowledge hidden in the complex and large-scale data sets, both aesthetic form and functionality are necessary. Information that has been abstracted in some schematic forms, including attributes or variables for the units of information, is also valuable for data analysis. This way is much more intuitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[169]</ref> than sophisticated approaches. Online marketplace eBay, have hundreds of million active users and billions of goods sold each month, and they generate a lot of data. To make all that data understandable, eBay turned to Big Data visualization tool: Tableau, which has capability to transform large, complex data sets into intuitive pictures. The results are also interactive. Based on them, eBay employees can visualize search relevance and quality to monitor the latest customer feedback and conduct sentiment analysis.</p><p>For Big Data applications, it is particularly difficult to conduct data visualization because of the large size and high dimension of Big Data. However, current Big Data visualization tools mostly have poor performances in functionalities, scalability and response time. What we need to do is rethinking the way we visualize Big Data, not like the way we adopt before. For example, the history mechanisms for information visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[64]</ref> also are data-intensive and need more efficient approaches. Uncertainty can lead to a great challenge to effective uncertainty-aware visualization and arise in any stage of a visual analytics process <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[195]</ref>. New framework for modeling uncertainty and characterizing the evolution of the uncertainty information are highly necessary through analytical processes.</p><p>The shortage of talent will be a significant constraint to capture values from Big Data <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[114]</ref>. In the United States, Big Data is expected to rapidly become a key determinant of competition across many sectors. However, this area demands for deep analytical positions on Big Data could exceed the supply being produced on current trends by 140; 000 to 190; 000 positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[114]</ref>. Furthermore, this kind of human resource is more difficult to educate. It usually takes many years to train Big Data analysts that must have intrinsic mathematical abilities and related professional knowledge. We believe that the same situation also happened in other nations, not matter developed countries or developing countries around the world. It is foreseeable that there will be another hot competition about human resources in Big Data developments.</p><p>After review a number of challenges, the optimists take a broad view challenges and hidden benefits. They have enough confidence that we have the capabilities to overcome all the obstacles as new techniques and technologies are developed. There are many critiques and negative opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">167,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">11]</ref> from the pessimists. Some researchers think Big Data will lead to the end of theory, and doubt whether it can help us to make better decisions. Whatever, the mainstream perspectives are most positive, so a large number of Big Data techniques and technologies have been developed or under developing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Big Data tools: techniques and technologies</head><p>To capture the value from Big Data, we need to develop new techniques and technologies for analyzing it. Until now, scientists have developed a wide variety of techniques and technologies to capture, curate, analyze and visualize Big Data. Even so, they are far away from meeting variety of needs. These techniques and technologies cross a number of discipline, including computer science, economics, mathematics, statistics and other expertises. Multidisciplinary methods are needed to discovery the valuable information from Big Data. We will discuss current techniques and technologies for exploiting dataintensive applications.</p><p>We need tools (platforms) to make sense of Big Data. Current tools concentrate on three classes, namely, batch processing tools, stream processing tools, and interactive analysis tools. Most batch processing tools are based on the Apache Hadoop infrastructure, such as Mahout and Dryad. The latter is more like necessary for real-time analytic for stream data applications. Storm and S4 are good examples for large scale streaming data analytic platforms. The interactive analysis processes the data in an interactive environment, allowing users to undertake their own analysis of information. The user is directly connected to the computer and hence can interact with it in real time. The data can be reviewed, compared and analyzed in tabular or graphic format or both at the same time. Google's Dremel and Apache Drill are Big Data platforms based on interactive analysis. In the following sub-sections, we'll discuss several tools for each class. More information about Big Data tools can be found in Appendix C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Big Data techniques</head><p>Big Data needs extraordinary techniques to efficiently process large volume of data within limited run times. Reasonably, Big Data techniques are driven by specified applications. For example, Wal-Mart applies machine learning and statistical techniques to explore patterns from their large volume of transaction data. These patterns can produce higher competitiveness in pricing strategies and advertising campaigns. Taobao (A Chinese company like eBay) adopts large stream data mining techniques on users' browse data recorded on its website, and exploits a good deal of valuable information to support their decision-making.</p><p>Big Data techniques involve a number of disciplines, including statistics, data mining, machine learning, neural networks, social network analysis, signal processing, pattern recognition, optimization methods and visualization approaches. There are many specific techniques in these disciplines, and they overlap with each other hourly (illustrated as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>Optimization Methods have been applied to solve quantitative problems in a lot of fields, such as physics, biology, engineering, and economics. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[153]</ref>, several computational strategies for addressing global optimization problems are discussed, such as simulated annealing, adaptive simulated annealing, quantum annealing, as well as genetic algorithm which naturally lends itself to parallelism and therefore can be highly efficient. Stochastic optimization, including genetic programming, evolutionary programming, and particle swarm optimization are useful and specific optimization techniques inspired by the process of nature. However, they often have high complexity in memory and time consumption. Many research works <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">198]</ref> have been done to scale up the large-scale optimization by cooperative co-evolutionary algorithms. Real-time optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[160]</ref> is also required in many Big Data application, such as WSNs and ITSs. Data reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[197]</ref> and parallelization <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[173,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">199]</ref> are also alternative approaches in optimization problems.</p><p>Statistics is the science to collect, organize, and interpret data. Statistical techniques are used to exploit correlationships and causal relationships between different objectives. Numerical descriptions are also provided by statistics. However, standard statistical techniques are usually not well suited to manage Big Data, and many researchers have proposed extensions of classical techniques or completely new methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[41]</ref>. Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[132]</ref> proposed efficient approximate algorithm for large-scale multivariate monotonic regression, which is an approach for estimating functions that are monotonic with respect to input variables. Another trend of data-driven statistical analysis focuses on scale and parallel implementation of statistical algorithms. A survey of parallel statistics can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[141]</ref>, and several parallel statistics algorithms are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[22]</ref>. Statistical computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">193]</ref> and statistical learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[63]</ref> are the two hot research sub-fields.</p><p>Data mining is a set of techniques to extract valuable information (patterns) from data, including clustering analysis, classification, regression and association rule learning. It involves the methods from machine learning and statistics. Big Data mining is more challenging compared with traditional data mining algorithms. Taking clustering as an example, a natural way of clustering Big Data is to extend existing methods (such as hierarchical clustering, K-Mean, and Fuzzy C-Mean) so that they can cope with the huge workloads <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[205,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">24]</ref>. Most extensions usually rely on analyzing a certain amount of samples of Big Data, and vary in how the sample-based results are used to derive a partition for the overall data. This kind of clustering algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[90]</ref> include CLARA (Clustering LARge Applications) algorithm, CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based upon RANdomized Search), BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing using Cluster Hierarchies) algorithm, and so on. Genetic algorithms are also applied to clustering as optimization criterion to reflect the goodness. Clustering Big Data is also developing to distributed and parallel implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[150]</ref>. Taking discriminant analysis as another example, researchers try to develop effective algorithm for large-scale discriminant analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">165]</ref>. The emphasis is on the reduction of computational complexity. Taking bioinformatics as another example, it becomes increasingly data-driven that leads to paradigm change from traditional single-gene biology to the approaches that combine integrative database analysis and data mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[23]</ref>. This new paradigm enables the synthesis of large-scale portraits of genome function.</p><p>Machine learning is an important subjection of artificial intelligence which is aimed to design algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data. The most obvious characteristic of machine learning is to discovery knowledge and make intelligent decisions automatically. When Big Data is concerned, we need to scale up machine learning algorithms, both supervised learning and unsupervised learning, to cope with it. Deep machine learning has become a new research frontier in artificial intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">200]</ref>. In addition, there are several frameworks, like Map/Reduce, DryadLINQ, and IBM parallel machine learning toolbox, that have capabilities to scale up machine learning. For example, Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is a very fundamental algorithm used in classification and regression problems, suffers from serious scalability problem in both memory use and computation time. Parallel SVM (PSVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">[196,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">121]</ref> are introduced recently to reduce memory and time consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>. There are many scale machine learning algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">177,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">85]</ref>, but many important specific sub-fields in large-scale machine learning, such as large-scale recommender systems, natural language processing, association rule learning, ensemble learning, still face the scalability problems.</p><p>Artificial neural network (ANN) is a mature techniques and has a wide range of application coverage. Its successful applications can be found in pattern recognition, image analysis, adaptive control, and other areas. Most of the currently employed ANNs for artificial intelligence are based on statistical estimations <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[113]</ref>, classification optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[131]</ref> and control theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[105]</ref>. It is generally acknowledged, the more hidden layers and nodes in a neural network, the higher accuracy they can produce. However, the complexity in a neural network also increases the learning time. Therefore, the learning process in a neural networks over Big Data is severely time and memory consuming <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[166,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">206]</ref>. Neural processing of large-scale data sets often leads to very large networks. Then, there are two main challenges in this situation. One is that the conventional training algorithms perform very poorly, and the other is that the training time and memory limitations are increasingly intractable <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[161,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">49]</ref>. Naturally, two common approaches can be employed in this situation. One is to reduce the data size by some sampling methods, and the structure of the neural network maybe remains the same. The other one is to scale up neural networks in parallel and distributed ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">202]</ref>. For example, the combination of deep learning and parallel training implementation techniques provides potential ways to process Big Data <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">42]</ref>.</p><p>Visualization Approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[169]</ref> are the techniques used to create tables, images, diagrams and other intuitive display ways to understand data. Big Data visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">64,</ref><ref type="bibr">53]</ref> is not that easy like traditional relative small data sets because of the complexity in 3Vs or 4Vs. The extension of traditional visualization approaches are already emerged but far away from enough. When it comes to large-scale data visualization, many researchers use feature extraction and a geometric modeling to significantly reduce the data's size before the actual data rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">182]</ref>. For more closely and intuitively data interpretation, some researchers try to run batch-mode software rendering of the data at the highest possible resolution in a parallel way <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">10]</ref>. Choosing proper data representation is also very important when we try to visualize Big Data. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[182]</ref>, author tried to compact data and give a good approximation to large-scale data.</p><p>Social Network Analysis (SNA) which has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology, views social relationships in terms of network theory, and it consists of nodes and ties. It has also gained a significant following in anthropology, biology, communication studies, economics, geography, history, information science, organizational studies, social psychology, development studies, and sociolinguistics and is now commonly available as a consumer tool. SNA include social system design <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[204]</ref>, human behavior modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[95]</ref>, social network visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">164]</ref>, social networks evolution analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[27]</ref>, and graph query and mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[111]</ref>. Recently, online social networks and Social media analysis have become popular <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">82]</ref>. One of the main obstacles regarding SNA is the vastness of Big Data. Analysis of a network consisting of millions or billions of connected objects is usually computationally costly. Two hot research frontiers, social computing and cloud computing, are in favor of SNA to some degree.</p><p>Higher level Big Data technologies include distributed file systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[148,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">32]</ref>, distributed computational systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[136]</ref>, massively parallel-processing (MPP) systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[185,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">181]</ref>, data mining based on grid computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[34]</ref>, cloud-based storage and computing resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[154]</ref>, as well as granular computing and biological computing. These technologies will be introduced in the following sub-sections.</p><p>Many researchers regard the curse of dimensionality as one aspect of Big Data problems. Indeed, Big Data should not be constricted in data volume, but all take the high-dimension characteristic of data into consideration. In fact, processing high-dimensional data is already a tough task in current scientific research. The state-of-the-art techniques for handling high-dimensional data intuitively fall into dimension reduction. Namely, we try to map the high-dimensional data space into lower dimensional space with less loss of information as possible. There are a large number of methods to reduce dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">56]</ref>. Linear mapping methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis, are popular linear dimension reduction techniques. Non-linear techniques include kernel PCA, manifold learning techniques such as Isomap, locally linear embedding (LLE), Hessian LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, and LTSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[98]</ref>. Recently, a generative deep networks, called autoencoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[70]</ref>, perform very well as non-linear dimensionality reduction. Random projection in dimensionality reduction also have been well-developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Big Data tools based on batch processing</head><p>One of the most famous and powerful batch process-based Big Data tools is Apache Hadoop. It provides infrastructures and platforms for other specific Big Data applications. A number of specified Big Data systems (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) are built on Hadoop, and have special usages in different domains, for example, data mining and machine learning used in business and commerce.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Apache Hadoop and map/reduce</head><p>Apache Hadoop is one of the most well-established software platforms that support data-intensive distributed applications. It implements the computational paradigm named Map/Reduce. Apache Hadoop (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>) platform consists of the Hadoop kernel, Map/Reduce and Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS), as well as a number of related projects, including Apache Hive, Apache HBase, and so on.</p><p>Map/Reduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[43]</ref>, which is a programming model and an execution for processing and generating large volume of data sets, was pioneered by Google, and developed by Yahoo! and other web companies. Map/Reduce is based on the divide and conquer method, and works by recursively breaking down a complex problem into many sub-problems, until these sub-problems is scalable for solving directly. After that, these sub-problems are assigned to a cluster of working notes, and solved in separate and parallel ways. Finally, the solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. The divide and conquer method is implemented by two steps: Map step and Reduce step. In terms of Hadoop cluster, there are two kinds of nodes in Hadoop infrastructure. They are master nodes and worker nodes. The master node takes the input, divides it into smaller sub-problems, and distributes them to worker nodes in Map step. Afterwards, the master node collects the answers to all the sub-problems and combines them in some way to form the output in Reduce step.</p><p>With the addition of Map/Reduce, Hadoop works as a powerful software framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[149,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">54]</ref> for easily writing applications which process vast quantities of data in-parallel on large clusters (perhaps thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner. We give a famous and prototypical example that counts the occurrence number of each word in a set of documents for Map/Reduce framework, where the two main functions Map () and Reduce () are given in the following. More detailed Java code from Hadoop is attached in Appendix B. The Map steps are implemented on Hadoop cluster in a parallel way, and a large number of lists of intermediate data pairs with the form (key, c) are produced, where key represents a specified word, and the parameter c indicates the count of the word appearance. In Reduce steps, those lists of data pairs are integrated to the final results recursively in the main function.</p><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, there are a master (JobTracker) and a number of slaves (TaskTracker) in the Map/Reduce framework. The master node is in charge of job scheduling and task distribution for the slaves. The slaves implement the tasks exactly as assigned by the master. As long as the systems start to run, the master node keeps monitoring all the data nodes. If there is a data nodes failed to execute the related tasks, the master node will ask the data node or another data node to reexecute the failed tasks. In practice, applications specify the input files and output locations, and submit their Map and Reduce functions via interactions of client interfaces. These parameters are important to construct a job configuration. After that, the Hadoop job client submits the job and configuration to the JobTracker. Once JobTracker receive all the necessary information, it will distribute the software/configuration to the TaskTrackers, schedule tasks and monitor them, provide status and diagnostic information to the job-client. From the foregoing, we know that coordination plays a very important role in Hadoop, it ensures the performance of a Hadoop job.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[139]</ref>, Andrew Pavlo gave an overall discussion on properties of Map/Reduce framework, as well as other approaches to large-scale data analysis. Many data mining algorithms have been designed to accommodate Map/Reduce. For example, data cube materialization and mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[126]</ref>, efficient skyline computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[61]</ref> and scalable boosting methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[138]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Dryad</head><p>Dryad <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[75]</ref> is another popular programming models for implementing parallel and distributed programs that can scale up capability of processing from a very small cluster to a large cluster. It bases on dataflow graph processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[101]</ref>. The infra- structure for running Dryad consists of a cluster of computing nodes, and a programmer use the resources of a computer cluster to running their programs in a distributed way. Indeed, Dryad programmers can use thousands of machines, each of them with multiple processors or cores. One bonus is that programmers does not need to know anything about concurrent programming. A Dryad application runs a computational directed graph which is composed of computational vertices and communication channels. The computation is structured as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>: graph vertices represent the programs, while graph edges denote the channels. A Dryad programmer writes several sequential programs and connects them using oneway channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[76]</ref>. A Dryad job is to generator a graph, and it has capability to synthesize any directed acyclic graph. These generated graphs can also be updated after execution, in order to deal with the unexpected events in the computation. Dryad provides a large number of functionality, including generating the job graph, scheduling the processes on the available machines, handling transient failures in the cluster, collecting performance metrics, visualizing the job, invoking userdefined policies and dynamically updating the job graph in response to these policy decisions, without awareness of the semantics of the vertices <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[101]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> schematically shows the implementation schema of Dryad. There is a centralized job manager to supervise every Dryad job. It uses a small set of cluster services to control the execution of the vertices on the cluster.</p><p>Because Dryad encompasses other computational frameworks like Map/Reduce and the relational algebra, it is more complex and powerful in some degree. Otherwise, Dryad is a self-contained system with complete functions including job creation and management, resource management, job monitoring and visualization, fault tolerance, re-execution.

Similar with JasperSoft, there is a chain between Pentaho's tool and many of the most popular NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[145]</ref> and Cassandra <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[36]</ref>. Once the connection to databases is established, users can drill up and drill down the columns into different information granules.</p><p>Business users can access their data though a web-based interface that Pentaho provided. With its easy way to use wizard-based approach, business users can turn their data into insight and make information-driven decisions very fast. The graphical programming interface developed by Pentaho, such as Kettle and Pentaho Data Integration, are very powerful tools to process massive data. Pentaho also develops softwares that are based on Hadoop clusters to draw HDFS file data and HBase data, so users just need to write their code and send them out to execute on the cluster. By this way, the data analytical processes are highly escalated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Stream processing Big Data tools</head><p>Hadoop does well in processing large amount of data in parallel. It provides a general partitioning mechanism to distribute aggregation workload across different machines. Nevertheless, Hadoop is designed for batch processing. It is a multi-purpose engine but not a real-time and high performance engine, since there are high throughout latency in its implementations. For certain stream data applications, such as processing log files, industry with sensor, machine-to-machine (M2M) and telematics requires real-time response for processing large amount of stream data. In those applications, stream processing for real-time analytics is mightily necessary. Stream Big Data has high volume, high velocity and complex data types. Indeed, when the high velocity and time dimension are concerned in applications that involve real-time processing, there are a number of different challenges to Map/Reduce framework. Therefore, the real-time Big Data platforms, such as SQLstream <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[6]</ref>, Storm and StreamCloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[57]</ref>, are designed specially for real-time stream data analytics.</p><p>Real-time processing means that the ongoing data processing highly requires a very low latency of response. Hence, there is not too much data accumulation at the time dimension for processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[175]</ref>. In general, Big Data may be collected and stored in a distributed environment, not in one data center. In the general Map/Reduce framework, the Reduce phase starts to work only after the Map phase finish up. But most of all, all the intermediate data generated in Map phase is saved in the disk before submit to the reducers for next phase. All these lead to significant latency of the processing. The high latency characteristic of Hadoop makes it almost impossible for real-time analytics.</p><p>Several Big Data tools based on stream processing have been developed or under developing. One of the most famous platforms is Storm, and others include S4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[128]</ref>, SQLstream <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[5]</ref>, Splunk <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[155]</ref>, Apache Kafka <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, and SAP Hana <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[93]</ref> (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Storm</head><p>Storm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[6]</ref> is a distributed and fault-tolerant real-time computation system for processing limitless streaming data. It is released as open source and free for remoulding. Storm is specifically designed for real-time processing, contrasts with Hadoop which is for batch processing. It is also very easy to set up and operate, and guarantees all the data will be processed. It is also scalable and fault-tolerant to provide competitive performances. Storm is efficient that a benchmark clocked it at over a million tuples processed per second per node. Therefore, it has many applications, such as real-time analytics, interactive operation system, on-line machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, and ETL.</p><p>A Storm cluster is ostensibly similar to a Hadoop cluster. Whereas on Storm users run different topologies for different Storm tasks. However, Hadoop platform implements Map/Reduce jobs for corresponding applications. There are a number  of differences between Map/Reduce jobs and topologies. The key one is that a Map/Reduce job eventually finishes, whereas a topology processes messages all the time, or until users terminate it <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[86]</ref>.</p><p>To implement real-time computation on Storm, users need to create different topologies. A topology (illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>) is a graph of computation and can be created and submitted in any programming language. There are two kinds of node in topologies, namely, spouts and bolts. A spout is one of the starting points in the graph, which denotes source of streams. A bolt processes input streams and outputs new streams. Each node in a topology contains processing logic, and links between nodes indicate how data should be processed between nodes. Therefore, a topology is a graph representing the transformations of the stream, and each node in the topology executes in parallel.</p><p>A Storm cluster consists of two kinds of working nodes. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>, they are only one master node and several worker nodes. The master node and worker nodes implement two kinds of daemons: Nimbus and Supervisor respectively. The two daemons have similar functions with according JobTracker and TaskTracker in Map/Reduce framework. Nimbus is in charge of distributing code across the Storm cluster, scheduling works assigning tasks to worker nodes, monitoring the whole system. If there is a failure in the cluster, the Nimbus will detect it and re-execute the corresponding task. The supervisor complies with tasks assigned by Nimbus, and starts or stops worker processes as necessary based on the instructions of Nimbus. The whole computational topology is partitioned and distributed to a number of worker processes, each worker process implements a part of the topology. How can Nimbus and the Supervisors work swimmingly and complete the job fast? Another kind of daemon called Zookeeper play an important role to coordinate the system. It records all states of the Nimbus and Supervisors on local disk.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Big Data tools based on interactive analysis</head><p>In recent years, Open source Big Data systems have emerged to address the need not only for scalable batch processing and stream processing, but also interactive analysis processing. The interactive analysis presents the data in an interactive environment, allowing users to undertake their own analysis of information. User are directly connected to the computer and hence can interact with it in real time. The data can be reviewed, compared and analyzed in tabular or graphic format or both at the same time. In 2010, Google proposed an interactive analysis system, named Dremel <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[118]</ref>, which is scalable for processing nested data. Dremel has a very different architecture compared with well-known Apache Hadoop, and acts as a successful complement of Map/Reduce-based computations. It has capability to run aggregation queries over trillion-row tables in seconds by means of combining multi-level execution trees and columnar data layout. The system scales to thousands of CPUs and petabytes of data, and has thousands of users at Google.</p></div>

It is similar to Google's Dremel. For Drill, there are more flexibility to support a various of different query languages, data formats and data sources.

Drill can be viewed as the open source version of Dremel. Google also provides Dremel-as-a-Service with its BigQuery offering. Other companies can design their own Big Data tools according to their special usages.</p><p>Every Big Data platform has its focus.

Each Big Data platform also has specific functionality, for example, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data stream processing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Principles for designing Big Data systems</head><p>Big Data analytics are doomed to be more complicated than traditional data analysis systems. How do we implement complex data-intensive tasks with satisfactory efficiency, especially in real-time? The answer is the capability to massively parallelize the analytical algorithms in such a way that all the processing happen entirely in memory and can linearly scale up and down on demand. When trying to exploit Big Data, we not only need to develop new technologies, but also new thinking ways. In designing Big Data analytics systems, we summarize seven necessary principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">51]</ref> to guide the development of this kind of burning issues. Big Data analytics in a highly distributed system cannot be achievable without the following principles: Principle 1. Good architectures and frameworks are necessary and on the top priority.</p><p>Big Data cannot be solved effectively and approvingly if there are no good and proper architecture for the whole Big Data systems. In traditional information architecture, data sources that use integration techniques to transfer data into a DBMS data warehouse or operational data store, and then offer a wide variety of analytical techniques to reveal the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[174]</ref>. Then some organizations have applied oversight and standardization across projects, and perhaps have matured the information architecture capability through managing it <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[135]</ref>. However, Big Data systems need high-level architecture than traditional one. Many distributed and parallel processing architectures have already been proposed to address Big Data problems. There are distinct technology strategies for real-time and batch processing requirements. For real-time, key-value data stores, such as NoSQL, allow for high performance, index-based retrieval. For batch processing, Map/Reduce can be applied according to a specific data discovery strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[174]</ref>. For different data-intensive applications, we should design different and appropriate architectures in the beginning of everything. For example, the Lambda architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[116]</ref> solves the problem of computing arbitrary functions on arbitrary data in real-time by decomposing the problem into three layers: the batch layer, the serving layer, and the speed layer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref>). But this architecture cannot fit all the Big Data applications.</p><p>Principle 2. Support a variety of analytical methods Big Data applications often produce complex tasks that make it impossible to be resolved by using one or a few of disciplines and analytical methods. The modern data science constantly involves a wide range of subjects and approaches. They range from data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, distributed programming and visualization to real-time analysis, in-memory analysis and human-computer interaction. These methods are often synchronously employed in different Big Data platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[136]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principle 3. No size fits all</head><p>When it comes to Big Data analytics, there is no one size which can fit all solutions, according to IBM's Latin America Big Data sales leader, Leonardo González <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[123]</ref>. Every Big Data tool has its own limitations, but if users use the proper tools for different tasks, they also can partially obtain significant benefits by using those tools. As the information keeps increasing at exponential rate, today's Big Data problem will surely become the small data set problem in the future. Therefore, how can we deal with the big Big Data problems? Until now, we cannot answer this question, but this question will give us some directions when we try to design data-intensive systems, especially for real-time analytics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principle 4. Bring the analysis to data</head><p>As the size of Big Data set is extremely large, it is unadvisable and infeasible to collect and move data to only one or several centers for analysis. Data-driven analysis needs contrary analysis direction, which needs to bring the analysis tasks to data sites. In data-intensive computation problems, data is the driver not analytical human or machines. Together with systematic thinking, this principle is also resonant with the following ones.</p><p>Principle 5. Processing must be distributable for in-memory computation.</p><p>If the fourth principle holds as expected, we naturally require the processing must be distributable, since the analysis which will be carried out on different data sites must be distributed to data locations. In-memory analytic <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[51]</ref> which probes data stored in RAM rather than on disk, as is traditionally the case, is becoming popular because it speeds up the analysis process, even as data volumes explode. In-memory analytic is also highly necessary for real-time analytic. With the development of hard disk drives, there are almost no differences between memory and hard disk in I/O speed. Thinking about that, we believe that applications based on real-time analytic will highly benefit from in-memory analytic or inmemory-like analytic. Principle 6. Data storage must be distributable for in-memory storage.</p><p>As a great portion of Big Data problems involve with the data and the information is generated at different addresses and different time, this principle is already met. But for the case that data generated or accumulated at data center, the data also need to be partitioned into a number of parts for in-memory analytic. The popular and potential technology cloud computing make the data storage in cloud. This is very appulsive in the Big Data problem solving. Once the data and services are stored in the cloud, users just like carry out their Big Data calculations on an unimaginative and powerful supercomputer. The real infrastructures are hidden in the cloud. Therefore, some data-driven applications can be realized.</p><p>Principle 7. Coordination is needed between processing and data units.</p><p>To improve scalability, as well as efficiency and fault-tolerance of Big Data systems, coordination between different processing units and data units on a cluster is highly necessary and essential. That is why both Storm and S4 employ independent and specialized cluster management frameworks (ZooKeeper) to control the whole data process. This principle guarantees the low latency of response which is particularly required in real-time analytics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Underlying technologies and future researches</head><p>The advanced techniques and technologies for developing Big Data science is with the purpose of advancing and inventing the more sophisticated and scientific methods of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and exploiting informative knowledge from large, diverse, distributed and heterogeneous data sets. The ultimate aims are to promote the development and innovation of Big Data sciences, finally to benefit economic and social evolutions in a level that is impossible before. Big Data techniques and technologies should stimulate the development of new data analytic tools and algorithms and to facilitate scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastructure so as to increase understanding of human and social processes and interactions. As we discussed, the novel Big Data tools, techniques, and infrastructures will enable breakthrough discoveries and innovation in science, engineering, medicine, commerce, education, and national security -laying the foundations for competitiveness for many decades to come.</p><p>A paradigm shift in scientific investigation is on the way, as novel mathematical and statistical techniques, new data mining tools, advanced machine learning algorithms, as well as other data analytical disciplines, are well-established in the future. Consequently, a number of agencies are developing Big Data strategies to facilitate their missions. They focus on common interests in Big Data researches across the US National Institutes of Health and the US National Science Foundation. In the following subsections, we will discuss several ongoing or underlying techniques and technologies to harness Big Data, including granular computing, cloud computing, biological computing systems and quantum computing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Granular computing</head><p>When we talk about Big Data, the first property of it is its size. As granular computing (GrC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[142]</ref> is a general computation theory for effectively using granules such as classes, clusters, subsets, groups and intervals to build an efficient computational model for complex applications with huge amounts of data, information and knowledge, therefore it is very natural to employ granular computing techniques to explore Big Data. Intuitively, granular computing can reduce the data size into different level of granularity. Under certain circumstances, some Big Data problems can be readily solved in such way.</p><p>GrC is a burgeoning conceptual and computing paradigm of knowledge discovery. In some degree, it has been motivated by the urgent need for efficient processing of Big Data, although the concept of Big Data have not be proposed when GrC is developing. In fact, GrC leads a significant transform from the current machine-centric to human-centric approach to information and knowledge. Theoretical foundations of granular computing are exceptionally sound and involve set theory (such as interval, box and ball), fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[71]</ref>, rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[83]</ref>, and random sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[122]</ref> linked together in a highly comprehensive treatment of this paradigm. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[143]</ref>, piecewise interval approximation and granular box regression are discussed to conduct data analysis. Su and his co-authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[176]</ref> introduced a new structure of radial basis function networks (RBFNs) that can successfully model symbolic interval-valued data. If Big Data can be transform into respective symbolic data, some algorithms in neural networks and machine learning come into play.</p><p>As well-known, GrC is called by a joint name for a variety of algorithms rather than one exact algorithm that is called granular computing. GrC is concerned with constructing and processing carried out at different level of information granules. The information represented by different level of granules show up distinct knowledge, features, and patterns, where the irrelevant features are hidden and valuable ones are highlighted. Taking satellite images as a example, the interests of researches within the low-resolution images may are the cloud patterns that present typhoons or other weather phenomena. However, in high-resolution satellite images, these large-scale atmospheric phenomena are ignored and small targets appear, such as a map of a city or a scene of a street. The same is generally true for all data. In different granularities of information, different features and patterns emerge. Hence, based on this fact, GrC is significantly useful to design more effective machine learning algorithms and data mining approaches.</p><p>There are a few of types of granularity that are often adopted in data mining and machine learning, including variable granulation, variable transformation, variable aggregation, system granulation (aggregation), concept granulation (component analysis), equivalence class granulation and component granulation.</p><p>As you known, the information hidden in Big Data maybe will lose partially if the data size is reduced to small ones. Not all the Big Data applications can use the GrC techniques as the process in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">14</ref>. It depends the confidence and accuracy of results the system required. For example, financial data in banks and government are very sensitive and require high accuracy in some special analysis, and the sensor data generated by users in ITS need to be processed and responded one by one. In these cases, GrC dose not work well, and we need other solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Cloud computing</head><p>The development of virtualization technologies have made supercomputing more accessible and affordable. Powerful computing infrastructures hidden in virtualization software make systems to be like a true physical computer, but with the flexible specification of details such as number of processors, memory and disk size, and operating system. The use of these virtual computers is known as cloud computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[50]</ref>, which has been one of the most robust Big Data techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[154,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">159]</ref>. The name of cloud computing comes from the use of a cloud-shaped symbol as an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it contains in system diagrams. It entrusts remote services with a user's data, software and computation. The combination of virtual machines and large numbers of affordable processors has made it possible for internet-based companies to invest in large-scale computational clusters and advanced data-storage systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[159]</ref>.</p><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">15</ref>, cloud computing not only delivers applications and services over the Internet, it also has been extended to infrastructure as a service, for example, Amazon EC2, and platform as a service, such as Google AppEngine and Microsoft Azure. Infrastructure vendors provide hardware and a software stack including operating system, database, middleware and perhaps single instance of a conventional application. Therefore, it shows out illusion of infinite resources without up-front cost and fine-grained billing. It leads to the utility computing, i.e., pay-as-you-go computing.</p><p>Surprisingly, the cloud computing options available today are already well matched to the major themes of need, though some of us might not see it. Big Data forms a framework for discussing cloud computing options. Depending on special need, users can go into the marketplace and buy infrastructure services from providers like Google and Amazon, Software as a Service (SaaS) from a whole crew of companies starting at Salesforce and proceeding through NetSuite, Cloud9, Jobscience and Zuora-a list that is almost never ending. Another bonus brought by cloud environments is cloud storage which provides a possible tool for storing Big Data. Cloud storage have good extensibility and scalability in storing information as demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">16</ref>.</p><p>Cloud computing is a highly feasible technology and attract a large number of researchers to develop it and try to apply to Big Data problems. Usually, we need to combine the distributed MapReduce and cloud computing to get an effective answer for providing petabyte-scale computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[108]</ref>. CloudView <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[15]</ref> is a framework for storage, processing and analysis of massive machine maintenance data in a cloud computing environment, which is formulated using the Map/Reduce model and reaches real-time response. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[84]</ref>, the authors extended Map/Reduce's filtering aggregation programming model in cloud environment and boosts the performance of complex analysis queries.</p><p>Apart from its flexibility, cloud computing addresses one of the challenges relating to transferring and sharing data, because data sets and analysis results held in the cloud can be shared with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[159]</ref>. There are a few disadvantages in cloud computing. The obvious one is the time and cost that are required to upload and download large quantities of data in the cloud environment. Otherwise, it becomes more difficult to control over the distribution of the computation and the underlying hardware. Furthermore, there are privacy concerns relating to the hosting of data sets on publicly accessible servers, as well as issues related to storage of data from human studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[159]</ref>. It is right to say that Big Data problems will push the cloud computing to a high level of development.   Human brain maybe can give a hand to help us to rethink the way we interact with Big Data. It captures and processes myriad of sensory data received moment of every day in an efficient and robust way. Human brain manages around a thousand TB of data and no neuron in the brain runs faster than 1 kHz, which is about the speed of a general PC in 1980s. However, human being does not feel heavy-headed while our brain boots up. That is because the biological computing system of our brain works in a distinct way compared with today's computer. Our brain does not need to locate and view large files with complex information sets. The information is partitioned and individually stored as simple data elements in the brain tissue. The processing for information in human brain is also executed in highly distributed and parallel ways. The multilocated storage schema and synchronous parallel processing approaches make our brain working so fast and efficiently.</p><p>Biological computing models (illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">17</ref>) are better appropriate for Big Data because they have mechanisms with high-efficiency to organize, access and process data in ways that are more practical for the ranging and nearly infinite inputs we deal with every day. For today's technology, all of information is locked away in backward style data collections that are fixed and unwieldy. However, if we can store all that information in a system which is modeled more on biology rather than traditional ways, and then apply significant and increasing processing power and intelligent algorithms to analyze, rather than just move it around mechanically, then we have the possibility of generating and interacting with the world and the characters of supernatural.</p><p>Computational intelligence, which is inspired by nature, is a set of computational methodologies and approaches to address complex real-world problems. We have reason to believe that computational systems can also be illuminated by biological systems. Biologically inspired Computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[26]</ref> maybe provides tools to solve Big Data problems from hardware design to software design. In analogy to nature, bio-inspired hardware systems can be classified as three axes, phylogeny, ontogeny, and epigenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[171]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[192]</ref>, authors give a review an emerging engineering discipline to program cell behaviors by embedding synthetic gene networks that perform computation, communications, and signal processing. Wang and Sun <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[188]</ref> proposed a bio-inspired cost minimization mechanism for data-intensive service provision. It utilizes bio-inspired mechanisms to search and find the optimal data service solution considering cost of data management and service maintenance. Tadashi <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[125]</ref> gave a review for biological communication (molecular communication) inspired by the cell and cell-to-cell communication. The data transformation and the communication between different computing units in Big Data systems maybe borrow some useful ideas from cells. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[140]</ref> two hardware processing architecture for modeling large networks of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, that integrate bio-inspired neural processing models into real-world control environments. Sergio <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> demonstrated self-synchronization mechanism, which borrowed from biological systems, as the basic tool for achieving globally optimal distributed decisions in a wireless sensor network.</p><p>Biocomputers is inspired and developed by biological molecules, such as DNA and proteins to conduct computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. A significant feature of biocomputer is that it integrates biologically derived materials to perform computational functions and receive intelligent and efficient performance. As demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">18</ref>, a biocomputer is composed of a pathway or series of metabolic pathways involving biological materials that are engineered to behave in a certain manner based upon the conditions as input of the system. The resulting pathway of reactions that takes place constitutes an output, which is based on the engineering design of the biocomputer and can be interpreted as a form of computational analysis. There are three kinds of distinguishable biocomputers, including biochemical computers, biomechanical computers, and bioelectronic computers <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[151]</ref>.</p><p>Once the Big Data technologies and techniques get mature enough, the following information revolution will incredibly change the way we process data. The computing systems become exponentially faster compared with current status, and novel data storage systems using biological models provide smarter interactions, inevitable data losses, and ambiguity. Genuine computational intelligence enables human-like analysis of massive quantities of data. It is true that the future con- structed by bio-inspired technologies are so remarkable that a large amount of funds and human resources are poured into related research activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Quantum computing</head><p>A quantum computer has memory that is exponentially larger than its apparent physical size, and can manipulate an exponential set of inputs simultaneously. It also can compute in the twilight zone of Hilbert space. This exponential improvement in computer systems might be possible, and real powerful computer is emerging. If a real quantum computer existed now, we could solve problems that are exceptionally difficult on current computers, of course, including today's Big Data problems. Although it is very hard to develop quantum computer, the main technical difficulty in building a quantum computer could soon be the thing that makes it possible to build one. For example, D-Ware Systems Company developed their quantum computer, called ''D-Wave one'' with 128 qubits processor and ''D-Wave two'' with 512 qubits processor on 2011 and 2013 respectively.</p><p>In essence, quantum computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[107]</ref> is to harness and exploit the powerful laws of quantum mechanics to process information. In a traditional computer, information is presented by long strings of bits which encode either a zero or a one. Dif-  ferently, A quantum computer uses quantum bits or qubits. The difference between qubit and bit is that, a qubit is a quantum system that encodes the zero and the one into two distinguishable quantum states. Because qubits behave quantumly, we can capitalize on the phenomena of ''superposition'' and ''entanglement'' <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. For example, 100 qubits in quantum systems require 2 100 complex values to be stored in classical computer systems. Nielsen and Chuang pointed out that ''Trying to store all these complex numbers would not be possible on any conceivable classical computer'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[129]</ref>.</p><p>Many certain problems can be solved much faster by larger-scale quantum computers compared with classical computers. That is because that quantum algorithms, such as Simon's algorithm, Shor's algorithm, and other algorithms for simulating quantum systems, are more efficient and faster than traditional ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[170]</ref>. Quantum computation does not violate the Church-Turing thesis, as classical computers also can simulate an arbitrary quantum algorithm with unlimited resources.</p><p>Despite quantum computing is still in a fledging period, quantum computational operations have been executed under a small number of quantum bits in practical experiments, as the theoretical research continues to be advanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[129]</ref>. Indeed, there are a number of university institutes, national governments and military funding research groups are working on quantum computing studies to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>As we have entered an era of Big Data which is the next frontier for innovation, competition and productivity, a new wave of scientific revolution is about to begin. Fortunately, we will witness the coming technological leapfrogging. In this survey paper, we give a brief overview on Big Data problems, including Big Data opportunities and challenges, current techniques and technologies. We also propose several potential techniques to solve the problem, including cloud computing, quantum computing and biological computing. Although those technologies are still under development, we have confidence that in the coming future we will receive several great breakthroughs in those areas. Undoubtedly, today and future's Big Data problems will benefit from those progresses.</p><p>There is no doubt that Big Data analytics is still in the initial stage of development, since existing Big Data techniques and tools are very limited to solve the real Big Data problems completely, in which some of them even cannot be viewed as Big Data tools in the true sense. Therefore, more scientific investments from both governments and enterprises should be poured into this scientific paradigm to capture huge values from Big Data. From hardware <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref> to software <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[163]</ref>, we imminently require more advanced storage and I/O techniques, more favorable computer architectures, more efficient data-intensive techniques (cloud computing, social computing and biological computing, etc.) and more progressive technologies (Big Data platforms with sound architecture, infrastructure, approach, and properties). Big Data also means big systems, big challenges and big profits, so more research works in these sub-fields are necessary to resolve it. We are fortunately witnessing the birth and development of Big Data </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
