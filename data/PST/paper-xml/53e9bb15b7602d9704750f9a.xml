<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R ESONANT tunneling devices play an important role as precursors for future nanoscaled ULSI circuits because at present they are the most mature type of quantum-effect devices. Compared to single electron transistors and more advanced quantum dot architectures, resonant tunneling devices are already operating at room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Furthermore, technological advances, such as the development of a III-V large scale integration process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and the recent demonstration of a Si/Si Ge /Si resonant interband tunneling diode at room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, are a motivation for circuit designers to investigate digital logic families and memory cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The basic idea behind resonant tunneling device circuit design is to exploit the nonlinear I-V characteristics with the typical negative differential resistance (NDR) region. If the properties of the devices are combined with novel circuit architectures beyond Boolean logic, the number of devices and the logic depth (latency) of basic circuit components are reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In this context, the isolation of the gate input and output signals is of fundamental relevance and has motivated the implementation of different three terminal tunneling devices. Significant examples are planar surface tunneling transistors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) that are integrated in the source or drain contact of a heterostructure field-effect transistor (HFET) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Vertical devices with Schottky or pn-junction side gates have also been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The common feature of these different devices is the combination of electronic amplification and NDR.</p><p>On the circuit level, different high-speed logic families based on the monostable-bistable transition logic element (MOBILE) have been proposed for tunneling devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The MOBILE gate is a pseudodynamic, clocked logic circuit and consists of two resonant tunneling diodes, which are operated in a monostable or bistable state depending on a pulsed powersupply voltage (clock).</p><p>The term pseudodynamic refers to the special circuit style in the sense that the logic transition of the gate is controlled by a clock similar to dynamic circuits. But in contrast to dynamic circuits where the logic state is represented by the electrical charge on a capacitor, MOBILE circuits are in a static, self-stabilizing state due to the inherent bistability of the devices. Consequently, they are more robust against charge leakage, and precharging is unnecessary.</p><p>The functionality of MOBILE-type gates is specified by embedding a logic input stage into the self-latching RTD pair <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This logic input stage can be used to implement a variety of different logic schemes, such as conventional Boolean logic, threshold logic, and multiple-valued logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Depending on the specific device technology, the input stage is composed of HFETs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, surface tunneling transistors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, or RTD-Schottky diode combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate suitable circuit architectures for MOBILE-type logic gates and improve the basic configuration by means of a monolithically integrated resonant tunneling diode heterostructure field-effect transistor (RTD-HFET), which is used in the input stage. Moreover, we analyze the impact of these novel logic gates on the circuit design methodology. A major intention of this paper is to investigate the use of multiple input threshold logic gates as a basis for speed-and area-optimized arithmetic circuits.</p><p>Starting from the device level, Section II describes the technology of an InP-based RTD-HFET. The basic principles of MOBILE-type circuits, their extension to threshold logic gates, and the question of an appropriate clocking scheme are discussed in Section III, including experimental results of a NAND/NOR gate. In Section IV, threshold logic gates are used as basic building blocks for two full adders having a minimum logic depth of two stages. Further aspects addressed in this section are an -bit pipelined threshold logic ripple carry adder and a pipelined carry-lookahead adder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. TECHNOLOGY OF InP-BASED RTD-HFETs</head><p>In this paper, a monolithically integrated three-terminal RTD-HFET <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is used to implement the logic input stage of a MOBILE circuit. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a cross section of the RTD-HFET fabricated on semi-insulating InP substrate. The monolithic integration of an RTD with any three terminal device requires:</p><p>1) a sequential planar growth of the different device layers, avoiding electronic barriers at the interface; 2) a self-aligned contact technology and a selective etch process, which provides low-resistance access to buried device terminals; 3) a device topology, which allows an appropriate adjustment of both absolute current and current density, respectively. While the growth of the two devices is very similar, several technological problems resulting from the three-dimensional monolithic integration have to be solved. In the following, a suitable layer stack of an RTD-HFET combination will be discussed in terms of the requirements mentioned above. The RTD structure is composed of an n-InGaAs layer, an i-InGaAs spacer, and an InGaAs/InAs quantum well, which is enclosed by two AlAs-barriers. The HFET is composed of a standard layer stack with a very thick, highly doped InGaAs-cap layer (50 nm). This layer structure is a modification of the RTD-HFET technology proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The Schottky barrier of the HFET is made of a Pt/Ti/Pt/Au gate, a 22-nm InAlAs/AlAs barrier, and a 4-nm InAlAs spacer.</p><p>At the boundary between the RTD and HFET structure, an n InAlAs etch stopper is included for a precise definition of the etching depth using selective etching. To enable a more effective tunneling through the InGaAs/InAlAs energy barrier, the InAlAs etch stop layer is highly doped and reduces the interconnection resistance between the internal HFET drain and the bottom RTD layer. The source and the drain contact of the RTD-HFET are alloyed Ni/Ge/Au electrodes. The alloy temperature was set to 300 C, which provides a contact resistance less than 0.2 mm per gate width without degrading the air bridges to the drain contacts.</p><p>In MOBILE circuits, the logic voltage levels and are depending on the RTD peak voltage and the amplitude of the pulsed power supply, as will be discussed in detail in Section III. To consider the gate voltage swing limitations of HFETs, an RTD peak voltage of V has been chosen so that the logic high voltage level is about V. This avoids gate currents due to HFET Schottky gate ( V) for logic high input voltages.</p><p>The I-V characteristics of a depletion-type RTD-HFET with a threshold voltage of V is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This device is a precursor for enhancement type RTD-HFETs, which are currently under development. At V (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, dashed line), the drain source current changes from an HFET-like saturating behavior to RTD I-V characteristics. For larger gate voltages V, the peak current is independent of the gate voltage because the RTD acts as a current limiting device. This is achieved by adjusting the RTD anode area and the HFET gate width , so that the saturation current of the HFET for V is larger than the RTD peak current . The RTD anode area is m , and the HFET gate length is m. To ensure the desired current limiting behavior of the RTD in spiteofthelargegatelength,anHFETgatewidthof m has been selected. In addition, we use a low peak current density of kA/cm based on an RTD layer stack with thick 2.2-nmAlAsbarriersand1.5-nmInGaAsspacerlayers.However, first-order approximations for scaled devices with submicrometer gate length and m show that a W/L ratio between 20 and 30 is sufficient to keep the HFET-RTD transition voltage below V. In this case, the improved HFET drive current allows the use of RTDs with an increased peak current density so that the device is suitable for logic circuits operating in the gigahertz regime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MOBILE-BASED LOGIC CIRCUITS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. RTD-HFET Inverter</head><p>In recent years, the MOBILE has become a fundamental circuit configuration for high-speed clocked RTD logic families <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. As mentioned in the introduction, the basic elements of a MOBILE are two RTDs, a driver RTD , a load RTD , and a pulsed power supply to switch the gate into a monostable or bistable state. The inset in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows a novel MOBILE-type inverter. In this circuit, the logic functionality is determined by the RTD-HFET, which has been proposed in the previous section.</p><p>The principle of the MOBILE inverter is illustrated in the load line diagrams in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>: During the initial phase in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(a), the circuit is in a monostable state. If the clock voltage is increased and exceeds a certain switching voltage V, the gate evaluates the logic state of RTD-HFET . The resulting logic output state depends on the difference of the peak currents between the load RTD and the bottom circuit branch at the metastable transition point, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4(b)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(c) shows the following active clock phase V where the gate remains in a self-stabilizing, bistable state.</p><p>From the circuit point of view, a MOBILE is a combination of a current-controlled logic circuit and a rising edge-triggered latch. The complete transfer function of the RTD-HFET inverter can be summarized as monostable for metastable for for and for and</p><p>(1) Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the transfer characteristics obtained from the stable equilibrium points of the load line diagrams. For a typical clock amplitude of V, the voltage swing of the RTD-HFET inverter is V. The areas of the RTDs are chosen so that the peak current of the load RTD is larger than the current of the driver RTD , but smaller than the current sum of and . From this follows that the gate switches to the logic high voltage if the input RTD-HFET is off. If is on, the current sum of and exceeds the current of the load RTD and the gate switches to the logic low voltage .</p><p>The difference between the RTD-HFET circuits proposed here and the original MOBILE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is the replacement of the HFETs in the logic input stage by RTD-HFETs. Our motivation for the use of NDR devices in the input stage is to achieve a systematic circuit design based on a single design parameter . For each NDR device, this design parameter describes the ratio of the RTD peak current in regard to an RTD designed with minimum dimensions. Here, the design parameter corresponds to the minimum RTD area of m . A significant feature of the RTD-HFET is that the peak current is independent of the gate voltage for V. Thus, if a logic high voltage is applied to the gate of the RTD-HFET, there is no difference between an RTD-HFET and the two RTDs, as is shown by the equidistant steps of the switching current difference in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4(b</ref>). In the original MOBILE with an HFET input stage, the implementation of a specific logic function can be quite complicated because a single design parameter corresponding to the RTD peak current is not available. Especially in more complex gates with multiple input terminals, the RTD-HFET input stage is of fundamental relevance to keep the design of threshold logic gates simple.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Two-Input NAND/NOR Gate</head><p>The next step towards a complete digital logic family is the implementation of a programmable NAND/NOR gate with two input RTD-HFETs and (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). The third RTD-HFET is used to switch between the NAND configuration ( V) and the NOR configuration ( V). Again, the specific logic function of the gate is determined by the design parameters of the RTDs and the RTD-HFETs , and . The only distinctive features between the NAND and NOR gate are the differences of the design parameters of the driver and load RTD (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>). Since the driver RTD is equal in both gates (</p><p>), the peak current difference is for the NOR gate and inverter and for the NAND gate, respectively, if all input transistors are off. The programmable NAND/NOR gate is basically a NAND gate. By switching on , the total current sum of the bottom circuit branch is increased by and thus the circuit function changes to a NOR gate.</p><p>A microphotograph of the NAND/NOR gate is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(b</ref>). The transient measurement results are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> for different combinations of the input voltages and in the NAND configuration. An important prerequisite for an application of these gates in larger circuits is the compatibility of the input voltage level and output voltage level (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The transient SPICE simulation (solid line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) is in good agreement with the measurement result apart from an overestimation of the logic low voltage. For the SPICE simulation, an analytical RTD equivalent circuit model has been developed using a simplified Tsu-Esaki formula for the resonance current similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In addition, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> demon-  strates that a very small input voltage swing of mV is sufficient to switch the NAND gate into the two different logic states.</p><p>A further advantage of the RTD-HFET input stage is the prospect that the proposed MOBILE is less sensitive to technological process variations if a complex logic function is implemented with multiple input terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In particular, HFET threshold voltage variations are a critical problem in the original three-input MOBILE <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For depletion-type HFETs ( V), standard deviations of 30 mV corresponding to 6.8% have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Since each input HFET has to provide an exactly defined amount of current at a distinct bias voltage, these deviations limit the total fan-in of this circuit configuration.</p><p>Although not experimentally verified yet, a MOBILE with RTD-HFET input stage can tolerate HFET threshold voltage variations to a greater extent because the switching current is defined by the RTD peak currents only. Here, recent investigations demonstrate RTD peak voltage and peak current variations of 2.5% and 5%, respectively, over a quarter 2-in wafer for the technology used in this work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. These values are comparable to standard deviations of (2.3-3%) achieved with other technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. A worst case estimation of the maximum fan-in based on these values predicts that RTD-HFET logic gates with up to seven inputs are manufacturable <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Driving Capability and Lateral Device Scaling</head><p>Due to the large HFET channel length of m and the low RTD peak current density, the technology used for the fabri-  In addition to the technological improvement, the circuit configuration also has been modified <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>: First, the load RTD is substituted by a depletion-type RTD-HFET. The clock is now applied to the HFET gate, and a constant supply voltage of V is used instead of a pulsed power supply. Second, a pulldown HFET is inserted, which is controlled by the inverse clock . The pulldown HFET speeds up the discharging of the load capacitance and reduces the high-to-low transition time at the end of a clock cycle. Since cascaded MOBILE gates require a multiphase clocking scheme, this inverse clock signal is available and does not lead to an additional circuit overhead. The HFET widths of the scaled logic circuits are m and m, respectively. For comparison, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>(b) shows a MOBILE with an HFET input stage, where the NAND function is implemented in the conventional way by means of two-input HFETs in series. The impact of different load capacitances has been simulated for both gates assuming the device parameters depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. The data for the enhancement and depletion mode HFETs with submicrometer gate length are extrapolated from the test circuit and agree with the experimental results from Mahajan and Adesida <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>For the gate in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>(b), the load capacitance is the sum of the driver RTD and the HFET gate-source capacitances of the subsequent circuit stage. The total load capacitance of the circuit in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>(a) also includes the capacitances of the RTDs in the input stage. Therefore, the load capacitance of this circuit is larger and depends on the fan-in.</p><p>In the transient SPICE simulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>), the effect of the subsequent circuit stage is considered by increasing a load capacitance from fF to fF in steps of 10 fF. This corresponds approximately to fan-out values up to six. The rise time of the clock signal is 15 ps for a supply voltage of V. The fan-out loading factor, that is, the increase of the output rise time per capacitance, of the RTD-HFET MO-BILE is 10 ps/10 fF and approximately twice of a MOBILE with HFET input stage. This result indicates that the RTD-HFET MOBILE has a slightly reduced driving capability compared to the MOBILE with HFET input stage for the critical logic input combination ( V, V) of the NAND gate. However, the simulation also demonstrates that gigahertz operation is achievable with the novel MOBILE circuit if the device parameters are comparable to the values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. For both circuits, the latching function of the MOBILE is clearly visible because the logic state is preserved in the second phase of the clock duty cycle when the input signals return to zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. RTD-HFET Threshold Logic Gate</head><p>Although the development of a complete Boolean logic family is an important milestone for RTD-HFET circuits, the prospect of implementing alternative logic schemes such as multiple-valued logic and threshold logic is of considerable interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. For circuit design, the most interesting feature of threshold logic is the parallel processing capability of multiple inputs on the gate level.</p><p>To implement an RTD-HFET threshold logic gate, the NAND/NOR gate is now extended by using more than three RTD-HFETs in the input stage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>). This enables a compact circuit design comparable to the size of conventional Boolean logic gates, but with extended functionality, as will be shown later. For simplicity, the clock HFET and the pulldown HFET introduced for the scaled NAND gates are omitted because they do not change the logic behavior of the threshold logic gates in principle.</p><p>A threshold gate computes a digital output by comparing the weighted sum of digital input signals to a given threshold value</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">sign if if<label>(2)</label></formula><p>(3)</p><p>If the weights and the threshold value are properly selected, a threshold gate computes any linear separable Boolean function of the inputs. Then, the design parameters of the RTD-HFETs are determined according to . For a positive weighted input , the corresponding RTD-HFET is placed in the upper circuit branch, whereas for , the device is connected in parallel to the driver RTD.  In a noninverting threshold gate, the threshold value is implemented as a single RTD together with the driver RTD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>). Assuming that the areas of and are equal [cf. (2)], that is, , the corresponding design parameter of the bottom RTD is then given by (4) Since the weighted sum is an internal, integer-valued signal, there is a certain similarity between threshold logic and multiple-valued logic, although threshold logic gates have digital encoded input and output states. For InP-based RTD-HFETs with a voltage swing below 1 V, this is advantageous because the noise margins of digital states are larger than those of multiple-valued logic states. Thus, threshold gates are more robust against device parameter variations than multiple-valued logic gates.</p><p>Typical applications of threshold logic circuits are arithmetic computations, such as parallel addition and multiplication <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. For these applications, the threshold gates have a fan-in of , a maximum weight of , and a maximum threshold value of . To illustrate threshold logic circuit design, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> shows a gate with two positive weighted inputs (</p><p>) and two negative weighted inputs ( ) implementing the function sign <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Here, the weights are and so that the design parameter of the input RTD-HFETs is . The weighted sum of the four inputs is given by the current sum .</p><p>Using this notation, it should be mentioned that the NAND/NOR Boolean logic gate introduced in Section III-B is an inverted threshold gate with three negative weighted inputs and negative threshold value. The negative threshold value is implemented by the load RTD. For the design of arbitrary threshold logic circuits, the basic steps are to find the optimal number of threshold gates, to determine the number of input terminals for each gate, to select the threshold values, and to connect the gates in a suitable multistage circuit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Clocking Scheme and Bit-Level Pipelined Operation</head><p>Before larger threshold logic circuits are presented, we focus on an appropriate clocking scheme for these gates. To operate cascaded MOBILE-type circuits composed of several stages in the correct order, it has to be guaranteed that the evaluation of a stage only starts after the output of the previous stage is valid. This is a typical requirement for clocked logic families.</p><p>Here, a possible solution is an overlapping clocking scheme with a phase delay between the clocks of two adjacent stages Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>. Four-phase overlapping clocking scheme. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. As an example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> shows a four-phase clocking scheme that can be locally generated on-chip from a single master clock and an appropriate inverter chain.</p><p>Together with the four-phase clocking scheme, the self-latching property of MOBILE circuits extends the capability of a conventional clocked logic family and enables a bit-level pipelined operation, also known as fine-grain pipelining, bit-level systolic operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and nanopipelining <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Bit-level pipelining generally increases the data throughput. Since the required latching function is an inherent property of MOBILE circuits, the implementation of the pipelined datapath does not increase the latency and the area. Apart from the enhanced logic capabilities, this is a further outstanding feature of MOBILE circuits compared to conventional circuit design where an overhead is caused by introducing latches between the logic stages.</p><p>If we concentrate on a four-phase clocking scheme, each of the four phases has an equal length 4 so that four pipeline stages are activated during a single clock cycle . The different phases of the clocking scheme are as follows.</p><p>Phase I: -Evaluation: During the rising edge of the clock, the gate evaluates the output (transition from monostability to bistability) and charges the load capacitance to the logic high voltage or logic low voltage , respectively. Phase II:</p><p>-Hold: After the evaluation phase has finished, the gate holds the result as long as the supply voltage remains high, that is, V. During this hold phase, the output is valid and the subsequent circuit stage starts with the evaluation phase.</p><p>Phase III:</p><p>-Reset: In the reset phase, that is, the falling edge of the clock, the load capacitance is discharged and the gate returns to the initial, monostable state (return to zero). Since this reset operation is a bistable-monostable transition, the switching process is symmetric for equal rise and fall times.</p><p>Phase IV:</p><p>-Wait: The clock cycle is finished by an inactive phase. During this phase, the inputs of the gate are changed according to the results of the preceding pipeline stage and thus race problems are avoided.</p><p>Although in this paper we restricted our considerations to a four-phase clocking scheme, it should be mentioned that an arbitrary multiphase clocking scheme is similarly applicable to operate MOBILE-type circuits in a bit-level pipelined way. In the sense of making the pipeline more elastic, the circuit performance can be further increased if the phase delay between two stage is adapted to the delay of different logic stages.</p><p>a self-timing approach provides a dedicated clock to each logic stage and is even discussed for submicrometer CMOS domino logic used in high-speed microprocessors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Since MOBILE-type logic is intended to operate at gigahertz clocking frequencies, it is obvious to consider these techniques when optimizing RTD-based circuit design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RTD-HFET ADDER CIRCUITS</head><p>Addition is the most frequently used operation in generalpurpose and application-specific processors. Therefore, the design of an efficient adder is essential for every circuit technology. In this section, two threshold logic full adder circuits are proposed as basic components of an -bit ripple carry adder (RCA). As a further improvement, a pipelined threshold logic version of a parallel -bit carry lookahead adder (CLA) is presented using a logarithmic depth tree structure. Due to the bit-level pipelined operation of the RTD-HFET threshold logic gates, our approach is interesting for future digital signal-processing applications where data throughput is of great relevance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Nonpipelined Threshold Logic Full Adder</head><p>As mentioned before, the main objective in developing threshold logic based RTD-HFET gates is to reduce the complexity of basic circuit components. To obtain a full adder function, three digital signals, the two operand bits ( ) of position , and the carry of the previous bit position are added to compute the sum and the carry . In the case of threshold logic, four different cases depending on the input sum are considered This is achieved by connecting two RTD-HFET threshold gates in a serial way (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>) so that the first gate computes the carry sign <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and the second gate performs the computation of the sum sign</p><p>The carry is also used as an internal carry flag in the second gate to compute the sum bit. Since two threshold gates are the most compact way to implement a full adder, this design demonstrates that threshold logic offers the opportunity to reduce the logic depth and the number of gates. However, in regard to a bit-level pipelined operation, the disadvantage of this first adder design is that the input operands ( ) are also used in the second stage. Due to the fourphase clocking scheme, the second stage starts the evaluation after a time delay of 4 and the input operands have to be stored in three MOBILE D-latches until this computation is finished in the third phase of CLK1. This leads to an additional circuit overhead if the full adder is used in an -bit pipelined ripple carry adder. Consequently, the adder design is not the best choice for a bit-level pipelined operation and one of the most characteristic features of MOBILE circuits is not efficiently exploited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Pipelined Threshold Logic Full Adder</head><p>To operate a threshold logic full adder in a bit-level pipelined fashion, the first design has to be modified in such a way that the input operands ( ) are not required to compute the sum bit in the second stage. The modified adder design is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref>. In this case, the complete adder cell comprises four threshold gates, which are arranged in two circuit stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The underlying idea of this alternative threshold logic algorithm is to exploit the periodical relationship between the sum bit and the operand sum . The first stage of the full adder contains three gates having the threshold values and classifies the operand sum according to the intervals , , and . Finally, the second stage </p><p>Again, the carry is computed in the first stage, but now the inputs of the second circuit stage are the intermediate results ( ). Consequently, the input operands of the first stage (</p><p>) are not required in the second stage. Therefore, at the cost of two additional gates, the modified full adder can be fully pipelined and is ideally suited for a pipelined -bit adder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Pipelined -Bit Ripple Carry Adder</head><p>The most simple hardware for parallel addition of two -bit numbers is an RCA composed of pipelined full adder cells. The carry bits are propagating in a diagonal direction so that the logic depth comprises pipeline stages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>). The carry-propagation path is the critical path of the RCA. Since the four-phase clocking scheme leads to four gate delays per clock cycle, the overall delay (latency) of an -bit RCA is . In addition to the full adder blocks, the RCA contains two triangular arrays of delay elements, which are typical for bit-level pipelined circuits to consider the propagation of the carries along the diagonal direction. This ensures that the operands and arrive simultaneously with the carry at the corresponding full adder at bit position . The delay elements are implemented as RTD-HFET threshold gates with a single input.</p><p>Also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref> is the input register where the -bit operands (</p><p>) and ( ) are stored before they are loaded into the first pipeline stage. The final sum bits ( ) are stored in the output register. Both the input and output registers are updated synchronously at each clock cycle and thus providing a high data throughput. The design of the registers for the RTD-HFET technology is straightforward using edge triggered MOBILE D-flip-flops <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Pipelined -Bit Carry Lookahead Adder</head><p>Carry lookahead addition is a well-known technique to decrease the latency of an -bit adder by reducing the logic depth to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The basis of a pipelined RTD-HFET threshold logic CLA is the Brent and Kung adder <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, which is modified to consider the properties of RTD-HFET threshold logic gates. The characteristic features that make the Brent and Kung adder attractive for nanoscale integrated circuits are the regular design of the binary tree structure and the low fan-out of the processing nodes. The processing nodes of the binary tree structure in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref>  The derivation of the equations above is based on a partition of the -bit adder into several blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. A single block comprises the bit positions (LSB) to (MSB) and generates a block carry : 1) if the MSB block from bit positions to generates a carry, that is, ; 2) if the MSB block propagates the carry of the LSB block , that is, . The complete block propagates a carry, that is, , if the LSB block and the MSB block propagate an incoming carry. The first stage of the and Kung adder computes the generate and propagate signals ( , ) from the input operands (</p><p>) at each bit position. The binary tree structure with depth results from the associative property of (9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>For an RTD-HFET circuit implementation, the Boolean equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> have to be transferred into threshold logic equations. Moreover, two important modifications are introduced to reduce the logic depth of the original Brent and Kung adder.</p><p>First, the double tree structure composed of the forward and inverse tree is transformed into a compressed tree by merging both structures together, as recently proposed for cell-based CMOS design <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and for a high-speed domino adder <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The resulting compressed tree structure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref>(b) and consists of two identical trees for even and odd bit positions. The tree structure for the even bit positions is shifted by one bit position to the left. In the case of an 8-bit adder, the computation of the carries (</p><p>) is done in the third stage together with . Carry is computed in the second stage together with .</p><p>The second modification is motivated by the capability of threshold logic gates to process multiple input signals. This removes the first stage of the Brent and Kung adder <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Instead   carries are available after the third stage and depend on an even or odd bit position <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> In the last circuit stage, the sum bits are computed from the two carries (</p><p>) and the input operands ( ) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The corresponding RTD-HFET circuit is the gate in the second stage of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>. Because of the bit-level pipelined operation, the operands ( ) are propagating through the CLA, and thus each generate and propagate block also contains two threshold logic D-latches, which are not explicitly shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">17</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Evaluation and Comparison</head><p>In spite of the fact that as yet only small test circuits composed of single RTD-HFET gates have been designed and fabricated, a first evaluation of the proposed RTD-HFET adders has been made to estimate the performance of this novel technology. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref> shows a comparison of the two -bit pipelined threshold logic adders and the original Brent and Kung adder in terms of time, area, and area-time product.</p><p>is the average area of an RTD-HFET block and is the clock cycle length.</p><p>The advantage of the threshold logic CLA is the reduced logic depth of compared to of the original Brent and Kung adder. If the progress in designing and fabricating MOBILE-based logic continues, these circuits could be operated at clocking frequencies of about 20 GHz. For the proposed CLA, this means that a 64-bit integer addition is computed by a seven-stage pipeline and would be finished in less than ps provided that an on-chip clock generation and distribution network for the four-phase clocking scheme is available.</p><p>The estimation of the overall area is more difficult and made under the assumption that the areas of the different circuit blocks are equal. This assumption is reasonable because each block consists of a comparable number of threshold gates with up to four input terminals. Then, the overall area can be approximated by the product of the logic depth, the average block size , and the number of bit slices, which is equal to the operand length .</p><p>A critical problem is the signal propagation delay of the interconnection wires. Since the full adders and the D-latches of the RCA are locally interconnected, we do not expect major difficulties for this type of adder. However, the CLA requires several nonlocal interconnections. Assuming that the distance between two adjacent circuit blocks is denoted by , we estimate the critical interconnection length of an -bit CLA tree structure using simple geometrical considerations for <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> The -delay of this block interconnect of length is <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where and are the wire resistance and the capacitance per unit length . Thus, the delay time of the critical interconnect increases proportional to the square of the operand length <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> In connection with the four-phase clocking scheme, the delay limits the clocking frequency of the CLA because the signals have to be transmitted to the subsequent pipeline stage within the hold phase (see Section III-E). Since the duration of the hold phase is , we obtain the following condition for a correct signal timing: <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> Consequently, the binary tree structure of the CLA is more sensitive to the impact of delays for larger operand lengths of 32 or 64 bit.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that the RCA architecture might be better suited for RTD-HFET circuits if a high integration density is intended and the RC delay dominates the circuit speed (</p><p>). For special-purpose III-V based RTD-HFET LSI digital signal-processing circuits with typical operand lengths of 8-16 bit, the CLA adder offers the highest performance. In this case, adding driver circuits to decrease the RC delay of long range interconnections might be a solution to overcome the performance limitation due to the signal propagation delay.</p></div>

CONCLUSION</head><p>The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive analysis of the design and application of RTD-HFET-based MO-BILE-type circuit architectures. Considering the present state of technology, the impact of these quantum-effect devices on logic circuit design has been investigated. Experimental results are presented for an RTD-HFET device and a NAND/NOR gate. Assuming an improvement of the technology, different topics such as driving capability, device scaling, clocking scheme, and interconnection delay have been discussed.</p><p>In particular, the benefits of threshold logic as a design style with an extended functionality are illustrated by two compact full adder circuits, a pipelined ripple carry adder, and a pipelined carry lookahead adder. The proposed designs demonstrate that the combination of quantum-effect devices, architectural improvements on the circuit level, and suitable VLSI algorithms are an important methodology for future nanoscale integrated circuits.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
