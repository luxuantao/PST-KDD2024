<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper establishes a type of total stability for the inputto-state stability property with respect to singular perturbations. In particular, if the boundary layer system is uniformly globally asymptotically stable and the reduced system is input-to-state stable with respect to disturbances, then these properties continue to hold, up to an arbitrarily small offset, for initial conditions, disturbances, and their derivatives in an arbitrarily large compact set as long as the singular perturbation parameter is sufficiently small.</p></div>

Representative examples of nonlinear multiple-time scale systems include chemical reaction networks <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, high-purity distillation columns 11 31, electromechanical networks <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, flexible mechanical systems <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, etc. Typically, such processes are modeled within the mathematical framework of' singular perturbations <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. These models are then used as a basis for the design of control systems. However, the majority of models are characterized by disturbances, unknown model parameters, etc., complicating further the stability analysis and controller design for such systems.</p><p>Motivated by the above, the problem of analyzing the stability properties of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems has received considerable attention in the literature. Early results focused on local results or imposed growth conditions on the nonlinearities of the system (see 191 and [SI for example). More recently, for systems without disturbances, <ref type="bibr">Saberi and Khalil [16]</ref> developed a set of sufficient interconnection conditions, expressed in terms of Lyapunov functions and their derivatives, to guarantee asymptotic stability of a point. <ref type="bibr">Da and Corless [7]</ref> followed the same approach to study the asymptotic stability of a class of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems whose fast dynamics are marginally stable. Other methods based on the so-called geometric approach for singularly perturbed systems have also been proposed 131. For systems with disturbances, approaches based on Lyapunov's second method have been proposed (see <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> for example) to derive sufficient conditions that guarantee boundedness of the trajectories of the system.</p><p>In this note, we address the analysis of singularly perturbed nonlinear systems having a reduced system that is input-to-state stable (see <ref type="bibr">[ 171)</ref> with respect to disturbances. We will show that this property is robust, in a sense to be made precise in Theorem I , to uniformly globally asymptotically stable singular perturbations. Our result is novel in that absolutely no interconnection or growth conditions are required, and the disturbances are not required to be small and/or slowly varying. The robustness we obtain is of a "total stability" type Manuscript received September 28, 1994; revised July 24, 199.5.

FURTHER FACTS ABOUT INPUT-TO-STATE STABILITY</head><p>In this section, we give three lemmas on the input-to-state stability property that will be used in the proof of Theorem 1. These lemmas are natural extensions of results given in [ 181 and should be useful as tools for other nonlinear stability results. Throughout, the lemmas will refer to (2). When applying these lemmas in the proof of Theorem 1, we may be considering systems with three groups of inputs.

(49)   Since we do not know a priori that z and are essentially bounded, to use the above inequalities we must work with the truncation of signals and exploit causality.  Note that even with H ( t ) 0, Theorem 1 does not provide any result concerning stability of or convergence to the origin. To guarantee such properties further assumptions are required. Indeed, consider the singularly perturbed system e4 = --% + t L where 1 ' E IR, z E R. One can easily see that the above system is in standard form, h(.c. 0) = 0, and its fast dynamics d?J ---.v possess a globally exponentially stable equilibrium ( y = 0). Moreover, the reduced system takes the form 2 = -T (59) which clearly possesses a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium (:r = 0). Thus, the assumptions of Theorem 1 are satisfied, and its result can be applied. However, the origin is not an asymptotically stable equilibrium for (57). This can be easily seen considering the linearization of (57) around the origin</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">3 E = % ti = --% + e.</formula><p>which possesses an eigenvalue in the right half of the complex plane for all positive values of 6. It is clear from the above example that we cannot draw any conclusions about the stability properties of the equilibrium point of the full order system from knowledge of the stability properties of the reduced-order systems without some type of additional interconnection condition. There are several possible interconnection conditions that can be imposed to guarantee stability of and convergence to the origin. Most efficient conditions are essentially related to the small gain theorem (see [21] and [15]) in one way or another. Saberi and Khalil provide Lyapunov conditions in [16] which are closely related to small gain conditions in an La setting. An L , nonlinear small gain condition is given in <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[ lo]</ref>. Perhaps the most straightforward, although conservative, interconnection condition i s the assumption that with B ( t ) 0, the origin of the slow and fast subsystems are locally exponentially stable. In this case, it can be shown <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> that there exists t sufficiently small such that the origin of ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is locally exponentially stable and that the basin of attraction does not shrink as t becomes small. In general, when a local interconnection condition is given that has this "nonshrinking" property, the result of Theorem 1 can be used to show stability and convergence from an arbitrary large compact set under Assumptions 1-3. This is obtained by choosing d,, d, sufficiently small to guarantee convergence in finite time to the domain of attraction of the origin.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The problem of estimating the stability domain [usually called domain of attraction (DA)] of an equilibrium point is well known in the area of nonlinear system analysis and control. In spite of a lot of work (see [I], [2], and references therein), there are no simple ways for finding reasonable guaranteed stability doma.ins especially when high-order general nonlinear systems are considered. Roughly speaking, a typical algorithm for computing estimates of the stability domain essentially consists of two distinct parts (see, for instance, [3]-[7]): i) a part where a Lyapunov function is selected according to some specified rules and ii) a part where an estimate of the domain of attraction is computed for the selected Lyapunov function. While part i) strongly depends on the used algorithm, part ii) is common to all the algorithms and irepresents the crucial point of the procedure. More precisely, part ii) requires one to compute the region where the derivative of the chosen Lyapunov function is negative definite and to embed the contour surfaces of the Lyapunov fumction within this region. This problem can be cast as a nonconvex optimization problem which is in general difficult to solve for the presence of local extrema. Most of the proposed approaches are based on gridding techniques (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[3] and [4]</ref>) which make them not very effective for higher dimensional systems. More recently, a more efficient Manuscript received February 17, 1994.
