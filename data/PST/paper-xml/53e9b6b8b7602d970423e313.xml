<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A new kinematic modeling convention for robot manipulators is proposed. The kinematic model is termed after its "completeness and parametric continuity" (CPC) properties. Parametric continuity of the CPC model is achieved by adopting a singularity-free line representation consisting of four line parameters. Completeness is achieved through adding two link parameters to allow arbitrary placement of link coordinate frames. The transformations from the world frame to the base frame and from the last link frame to the tool frame can in the CPC model be modeled with the same modeling convention as that used for internal link transformations. Since all the redundant parameters in the CPC model can be systematically eliminated, a linearized robot error model can be constructed in which all error parameters are independent and span the entire geometric error space. These properties make the CPC model particularly useful for robot calibration. The paper focuses on model construction, mappings between the CPC model and the Denavit-Hartenberg model, study of the model properties, and its application to robot kinematic calibration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION HE kinematic model for robot manipulators presented</head><p>T in this paper was motivated by the special needs of robot calibration [l], <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. A kinematic model suitable for robot calibration should be "complete" <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> and "parametrically continuous" [4] (or "proportional" as termed in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>). The proposed model has both properties and is thus named a "complete and parametrically continuous" (CPC) model.</p><p>It is assumed throughout the paper that the robot links are rigid. A complete kinematic model is one that has the capability of relating the joint displacements to the tool pose for any manipulator while allowing for the arbitrary placement of the world frame and arbitrary assignment of the manipulator zero position. Another way of defining completeness is to say that a complete model has enough parameters to express any variation of the actual robot structure away from the nominal design. To be complete, the model must contain the required number of independent kinematic parameters. This number, for a serial manipulator consisting of rigid links connected by lower pair joints, is 4N -2 P + 6, where N is the number of degrees of freedom and P is the number of prismatic joints ~31, PI. Parametric continuity implies no model singularities. Formally, a kinematic model is parametrically continuous if continuous changes of position and orientation of any robot joint axis result in continuous changes of the model link parameters. Lack of parametric continuity in the model may invalidate accuracy error models and may also cause numerical instabilities in the kinematic identification process.</p><p>The Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) modeling convention [6], as presented in <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, is neither complete nor parametrically continuous. Parameter jumps occur when two consecutive joint axes change from parallel to almost parallel [8], <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. An equally serious problem in the basic form of the D-H model is the restriction imposed by the modeling convention on the assignment of the world and tool coordinate frames. If the world and tool frames cannot be placed arbitrarily, their location will vary due to variations in the robot geometry, as was pointed out in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The D-H model can be made complete through the use of additional fixed D-H transformations <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>.</p><p>Alternative kinematic models have been proposed in the robot calibration literature to overcome these difficulties. Hayati <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> introduced an extra rotation Rot(y, @) to the D-H model to represent a small misalignment of two consecutive parallel axes. A unique technique to collect pose data making use of a closed-loop kinematic chain and Hayati's D-H model was demonstrated by Bennett and Hollerbach <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Stone [12]</ref> in his S-model added two parameters to the D-H model to allow an arbitrary placement of link frames. The S-model is thus complete but not parametrically continuous.</p><p>Mooring [SI and Mooring and Tang <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> used the so-called "zero reference" model, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. This model, which is based on Rodrigues' equation, first establishes a reference coordinate system that is fixed in the workspace and a tool coordinate system that is attached to the end-effector of the robot. A zero position for the manipulator is then defined. (Incidentally, the D-H model does not allow freedom in the selection of the robot zero position.) The values of the direction unit vector and the location of each axis in the reference coordinate frame are then defined for every joint while the robot is in the zero position. The tool coordinate frame is located arbitrarily. The model is complete. Construction of an error model needed for kinematic identification is, however, not straightforward. The elimination of redundant parameters as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> requires the strong assumption that rotation and translation errors in certain directions are negligible.</p><p>A robot calibration procedure, which requires neither knowledge of the nominal model nor the use of the error model of the robot, was developed by Broderick and Cipra <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, based on Sheth and Uicker's shape matrix notation [16]. The model description separates the joint motion from the link geometry. Each link transformation is a product of two matrices-the motion matrix and the shape matrix. The shape matrix is a general displacement matrix relating two fixed coordinate frames located on each "end" of the link. This model too is complete. The calibration method using such a model requires pose measurement to be taken while each robot joint is individually and successively moved beginning with the last joint and ending with the first. The shape matrix of each link can then be constructed using the identified geometric features of each joint. A limitation of the shape matrix convention in its general form is that the redundant link parameters introduced for the convenience of link frame assignment are difficult to eliminate, which prevents the application of the method to error-model based robot calibration.</p><p>Roberts [ 171 surveyed commonly used line representations (such as point-and-orientation, Plucker coordinates and Denavit-Hartenberg), and concluded that these all either have singularities or redundant parameters. He then presented a new line representation consisting of four parameters, which is the theoretical minimum. By way of specifying the orientation of a coordinate frame on the joint axis line, as shown in Section 11, the only singularity in the line representation becomes removable.</p><p>The CPC model proposed in this paper synthesizes many attractive features of the previously mentioned kinematic modeling methods. As in the zero-reference and the shape matrix notations, the CPC model separates the joint motion from the link geometry. The resulting link shape matrices are expressed in terms of the relative direction unit vector of each joint axis together with relative distance parameters. <ref type="bibr">Roberts</ref> The CPC convention allows for a closed-form solution to the kinematic parameter identification problem [ 181. The solution method consists of two stages. In the first stage, the CPC orientational parameters of the revolute joints are first determined recursively under the condition that the pose measurements of the robot are taken while moving each revolute joint individually and successively. In the second stage, the remaining CPC parameters are simultaneously determined using the orientational parameters obtained earlier.</p><p>The second stage computation allows the use of poses taken from random motions of both revolute and prismatic joints. This measurement strategy was employed by <ref type="bibr">Lenz and Tsai [19]</ref> for calibrating a Cartesian robot.</p><p>The closed-form kinematic identification solution method provided by the CPC convention, the direct joint axis identification methods [12], [20], [21], and the shape matrix method require all or some of the joints to be moved individually and successively. These methods have a common limitation associated with the calibration measurement phase. When using contact devices, such as coordinate measuring machines, it may be very difficult if not impossible to select an initial robot configuration and ranges of joint motions to keep the calibration tool, mounted on the robot end-effector, within the workspace of the measurement equipment. In the case of noninvasive calibration using camera devices or theodolites, there are issues of maintaining a line of visibility at all measurement configurations between the measuring device and the calibration tool.</p><p>Error-model-based robot calibration, on the other hand, usually avoids such limitations. Another advantage is that error-model-based calibration usually requires much fewer pose measurements compared to the joint axis identification or the shape matrix methods.</p><p>The CPC model is highly suitable for the construction of error models. Unlike the zero-reference and the shape matrix conventions, all additional link parameters to Roberts' line parameters, except for those necessary for the last link transformation, can be easily eliminated since these redundant parameters are only introduced for the convenience of link frame assignment. The remaining parameters are independent and span the entire parameter error space. Error models for the BASE and TOOL transformations can be constructed using exactly the same convention of error-model construction as for the internal 1inks.The CPC model is as compact and user friendly as the D-H model. For "simple" robots whose joint axes are nominally parallel or orthogonal one to another. the CPC link coordinate frames and link parameters can be assigned by inspection.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Roberts' line representation is summarized in the next section. Sections 111 and IV present the CPC modeling convention along with several illustrative examples. Extraction of link parameters from a given link homogeneous transformation is described in Section V. Sections VI and VI1 focus on the relationship between the CPC and the D-H model parameters. Section VI11 is an attempt to cast model parametric continuity on a more rigorous mathematical basis. Calibration simulation and experimental results using the CPC model are presented in Section IX.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">A SINGULARITY-FREE LINE REPRESENTATION</head><p>A line lI3 in 3-D space may be expressed in terms of four parameters by means of the following method [17]. Let the orientation of the line be specified by two direction cosines in a suitable reference coordinate frame ( 2 , y, z}. Let the position of the line be specified by a point P , the intersection of the line with a plane E3 that is perpendicular to the line and passes through the origin of {x, y, z } (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). A 2-D Cartesian coordinate frame is defined on the IB plane, the origin of which is taken to be coincident with that of the reference frame. The remaining two parameters are taken to be the coordinate values in that local frame of point P. Line lI3 can then be represented by a four tuple {b,, by, l,, Zy}, where b, and by are the z and y components of the direction unit vector b; 1, and 1, are the coordinates of point P in the 2-D coordinate frame defined on the IB plane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Note that b,, the z component of the (1)</p><p>By definition (through adopting the plus sign in (l)), the direction unit vector b is forced to lie in the upper half-space of the reference frame.</p><p>A convention for choosing the coordinate axes of the local 2-D frame remains to be defined. As suggested by Roberts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, the projection of the 2 axis of the reference frame on the B-plane is taken to be the 2 axis of the local frame. Let z be a unit vector along the z axis of the reference frame. The reference frame is thus rotated by an angle of a about an axis k, where a arccos(z. b) = arccos(b,)  Each joint is assumed to be either ideally revolute or ideally prismatic. A Cartesian coordinate frame {xi, y;, z;}, i = -1,O, . . . , n, is established for each link. The world, base, and tool frames are denoted as the -lth, Oth, and nth link frames, respectively. BASE, the transformation from the world to the base frames, is fixed and defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">BASE G Bo. (<label>6b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>Robot calibration often necessitates the definition of a so- called "flange frame" located on the mounting surface of the robot end-effector <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. FLANGE, the transformation from the ( n -1)th link frame to that frame, contains the joint variable q, while TOOL, the transformation from the flange to the tool frames, is fixed. Thus \I . 11 denotes the Euclidean norm. The rotation matrix R is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F L A N G E . TOOL E B,.

R is undefined from (4) when b = z. R, however, can be defined without explicit reference to z x b.

Since b, is by definition nonnegative, R is well defined for any direction of the line in 3-D space. Thus, the unit basis vectors z',g',z' for the new coordinate frame are given by the first, second, and third columns of R, respectively. and tool frames can be assigned arbitrarily with the only restriction that the z axis of the world frame must not lie opposite to that of the base frame and the z axis of the tool frame must not be opposite to that of the ( n -1)th link frame.</p><p>All other link frames are established based on the following convention:</p><p>1) The z; axis must be on the (i + 1)th joint axis for a revolute joint and parallel to it for a prismatic joint.</p><p>2) The coordinate frame {xi, yi, z;} forms an orthonormal right-hand system. Remark 1: Link coordinate frame assignment follows Roberts' convention (see (1)). If, however, due to a physical constraint, the z axis of the world frame must point in an opposite or almost-opposite direction to the z axis of the base frame, an intermediate frame can be introduced to avoid model singularity. This also holds in the case when the z axes of the tool and the ( n -1)th link frames are in opposite directions. A possible choice of such an intermediate frame is to have its z axis be perpendicular or almost perpendicular to the respective neighboring z axes.</p><p>The CPC modeling convention virtually allows arbitrary assignment of link coordinate frames. To achieve this, two parameters, pi and Z;,+, are added to Roberts' line parameters.</p><p>Rot(z, pi) is introduced to allow an arbitrary x axis orientation of the ith link frame, and Trans(O,O,Z;,,) is introduced to allow an arbitrary positioning of the ith link frame. pi and li,+ are redundant for i = 1,2, . . . , n -1, and thus can always be set to zero for these internal link transformations.</p><p>In the case of a revolute joint, the link transforma- If the ith joint is revolute, then (refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>) 1) bi is the direction unit vector of the (i + 1)th joint axis</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">tion</formula><p>2) pi depends on the arbitrary direction of the xi axis.</p><p>3) I; is the origin of the ith link frame represented in the rotated (i -1)th frame.</p><p>4) The zero position of joint variable 0; (for i = 1,. . . , n) corresponds to the zero reading of the ith joint position transducer.

This is an advantage of the CPC modeling convention over other six-or sevenparameter modeling conventions.

Vi is specified by all the fixed-link parameters in the ith link transformation Bi and is independent of the ith joint variable. The assignment of link frames and link parameters for a "simple" robot (ie, two consecutive links that are either perpendicular or parallel to each other) can be greatly simplified.

EXAMPLES OF THE CPC MODEL</head><p>Example 1: Consider two consecutive link transformations with revolute joints (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>). Let the zi-1 axis be nominally perpendicular to the zi-2 axis (bi-1 = [-l,O, OlT), and the z; axis be nominally parallel to the zi-1 axis (bi = [O,O, 1IT).

As can be seen, a small variation in the joint axis pose results in a small change of the CPC link parameters. Recall that in this case since the (i -1)th and the ith joint axes become intersecting, the D-H parameter a; (common normal length, refer to Section VI) jumps from the nominal value of to zero, and the D-H offset distance parameter di jumps from zero to a very large value of pi,yc;l(~ - Example 2 -Modeling of Joint Offsets: Consider a case in which the reading of a joint variable is set to zero while the actual (physical) joint angle is not at the zero position. The deviation from the zero joint position is called a "joint offset." Assume that the only geometric error of the ith link is its joint offset. In the D-H model, it is modeled by dei (or ddi). In the CPC model, nominal joint variables are used to describe the motion of the robot. Joint offsets can be accounted for through dZi. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> shows such an example in which the nominal geometry of the link is the same as that given in Example 1 (in the figure, the superscript "0" denotes a nominal entity). The joint offset here is modeled by dli,, and dlj,y.</p><p>If geometric errors involve both joint offsets as well as axis misalignment, it is important to stress that dei (or ddi) in the D-H model no longer represents the ith joint offset as the joint offset also depends on other parameter errors. This is similar for the CPC model. However, since joint offsets are redundant parameters, the identified independent CPC error parameters are sufficient for accounting, in the least squares sense, for precalibration pose errors. In addition, this set of independent parameters is sufficient for least squares updating of nominal joint commands to minimize the postcalibration pose errors 141, [221, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Remark5: In the case where the world and base z axes are parallel and opposite, the BASE transformation is broken into a product of two transformations. Using the same line of reasoning as above, one may fix one of these transformations at its nominal value and use six independent parameters from the other for kinematic identification and compensation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USING THE CPC ERROR MODEL</head><p>In this section, we present calibration simulation and experimental results performed on the PUMA 560 robot. A CPC error-model reduction to a model in which the unknown link parameter errors are all independent can be performed in quite a straightforward manner following the path given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. Readers are referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> and [4] for complete CPC error-model derivations and more detailed experimental results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simulation Results</head><p>A simulation study was conducted to compare the performance of the CPC error model with that of the Denavit-Hartenberg model.</p><p>The geometry of the PUMA arm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">9</ref> along with the CPC link coordinate frame assignment. The nominal link parameters of B1, Bz, . . . , Bg, obtained from engineering drawings of the PUMA arm, as well as those of B A S E and FLANGE.TOOL are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>. Six independent error parameters are allocated in the TOOL transformation.</p><p>The CPC error model is constructed following the method given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Care should be taken when eliminating an error parameter from the set { db,, db,, db,}. If, for instance, db, and db, are chosen as the independent parameter errors, then db, is eliminated by b,dbx + b db <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref> db, =b, y .</p><p>Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref>, however, has a singular point b, = 0. The following convention for selecting the independent parameters was used to avoid such singularities:   1) Eliminate the error parameter corresponding to</p><p>2) The direction cosines vector b shall be kept a unit vector For a complete kinematic error model, as was mentioned in the introduction, the maximum number of observable parameters is 4N -2 P + 6 [5], where N is the number of degrees of freedom of the robot and P is the number of prismatic joints.</p><p>Six additional parameters are used for the arbitrary placement of the tool and world frames. The error parameters in the CPC model are shown in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>.</p><p>To compare the performance of the CPC model to that of the D-H model, Hayati's modified D-H model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> was adopted for some of the internal link transformations since the error model derived from the original version of the D-H model is always singular for robots with parallel consecutive joint axes. Whenever two consecutive axes are not parallel, the ordinary D-H model is used. On the other hand, whenever two consecutive axes are parallel, Hayati's convention is used. Thus. for the PUMA robot In Hayati's convention, the elimination of Trans(aa,O, 0) and inclusion of Rot(y,pz) avoid singularities of the D-H model for two consecutive parallel axes. To completely describe the geometry of the PUMA arm, a TOOL transformation needs to be specified. The following six-parameter was initially attempted but turned out (as will be seen shortly) not to be a good choice.</p><p>A total of 30 independent parameters are used in this error model too. The error model based on the modified D-H (MDH) convention, except for the TOOL transformation, was reported in <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. The modified D-H parameters of the PUMA arm are listed in Table <ref type="table">111</ref>.</p><p>To check the sensitivity of the identification algorithms to measurement noise, uniformly distributed random noise processes were injected to all components of position and orientation measurements. The position noise was U[-O.l,O.l] mm and the orientation noise was U[-O.OO1,0.001] rad. Twenty-five measurements were randomly taken within the PUMA workspace. Among these, 15 were used for identification and 10 for verification. The Levenberg-Marquardt <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> nonlinear least squares procedure was applied for parameter estimation.</p><p>Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate the mean and maximum position and orientation errors produced by the two algorithms. The standard deviation plots follow a similar pattern to the mean and maximum errors and were therefore omitted. While both models produced similar position error results if the number of measurements exceeded 7, the modified D-H model totally failed in estimating orientation errors. This is because the rotation part of the error model is singular whenever = 0" and a6 = C6 = 0. Physically, this is the case in which the tool z-axis is coincident with the last joint rotation axis. Indeed, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, a different convention was adopted to model TOOL. By changing the direction of the z axis of the tool frame to avoid = 0", we obtained accuracy results that were very similar to those of the CPC model. It is evident that the choice of independent parameters in the TOOL transformation with the convention given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> requires the user to have a fair amount of understanding of robot kinematics. The CPC model, in comparison, requires no special BASE and TOOL conventions, no matter what the respective joint axes orientations are. Users need only specify the number of degrees of freedom, the joint types, and whether two consecutive joints are nominally parallel or perpendicular. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experimental Results</head><p>The PUMA 560 calibration experiment system, similar to the one used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">12</ref>), consisted also of a Mitutoyo Model CX-D2 coordinate measuring machine (CMM) and an IBM PC-AT computer. The CMM had a rated repeatability of 0.01 mm and a work volume of 400 x 500 x 800 mm3. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">13</ref> shows the operating envelopes of both the PUMA arm and the CMM. Calibration results may not be valid outside of the calibration work volume.</p><p>The robot base coordinate frame was placed at the intersection of the first joint and second joint axes of the PUMA arm. The tool coordinate frame was placed at the tooling ball center of the end-effector. The CMM position indicators were set to zero after driving each axis to its travel limit. This established the coordinate frame for the CMM, which was then defined as the world coordinate frame for the measurement process.</p><p>The nominal CPC parameters for the PUMA arm in the experimental study are the same as those listed in   in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref>. This set of nominal parameters was established experimentally using "crude" position measurements. Since the end-effector orientation is not measured in the experiment, the number of observable parameters is reduced by three. Furthermore, the z axes of the last two link frames    model are unobservable <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. Thus, a total of 25 error parameters were used in kinematic identification. The error parameters for links 0 to 4 are shown in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>, and the remaining observable parameters are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">V</ref>.</p><p>A B A S E error model that expressess the differential relationship between the pose errors of the robot and the CPC B A S E parameter errors only was also employed in the experiments. There were six independent error parameters, dbo,x, dbo,z, dlo,x, dlo,y, dlo,= and dp, in the B A S E error model.</p><p>Sets of 10, 25, and 50 calibration points from both left-and right-arm configurations of the PUMA robot were used in the experiment. The linearized CPC error model and the B A S E error model were applied for error parameter estimation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">VI</ref> shows the identified error parameters with 10 calibration points using the B A S E error model only. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">VI1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">VI11</ref> show the identified error parameters with 10 and 25 calibration points, respectively, using the complete CPC error model. The identified error parameters with 50 calibration points came very close to those presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">VI11</ref> and therefore are not shown.</p><p>In order to supress the influence of measurement noise, and as a rule of thumb, the number of measurement equations should be roughly twice to three times larger than the points taken from both arm configurations. Model-5: The identified complete CPC model with 50 data points taken from both arm configurations. Accuracy compensation experiments were performed following the error parameters identification process. Unfortunately, the time period between the identification and compensation experiments was about two months since during this time the PUMA arm was not available. Both the PUMA arm and the CMM were placed at different locations in the two experiments. Therefore, the B A S E transformation had to be reidentified before carrying out the compensation experiment. Eight test points were checked for all identified models. The linear quadratic regulator algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> was used to compute the required joint corrections. The compensation results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">14</ref>. By accuracy compensation, the mean positioning errors of the PUMA robot were reduced from about 1.7 mm to about 0.3-0.4 mm. Further accuracy improvements are limited by measurement noise in the system, quantization effects in the VAL I1 controller, and unmodeled nongeometric errors. compact and easy to apply as the D-H model. The CPC model is very convenient for the construction of error models since error models for the BASE and TOOL transformations can be constructed using exactly the same convention of errormodel construction as for the internal links. For a general error model, users need only specify the number of degrees of freedom, the joint types, and whether two consecutive joints are nominally parallel or perpendicular. The model was tested experimentally and was shown to be effective for error-modelbased kinematic identification. Another advantage of the CPC model is that, since direction vectors of joint axes are directly used as link parameters, the model is particularly suitable for joint-axis identification techniques. One more advantage is that the CPC parameters can be solved linearly from the robot forward kinematic model, provided that the robot full poses are measured in a certain sequence [MI. This provides a means for kinematic parameter identification in cases of large parameter errors. Whether or not the CPC model will be helpful in robotic applications other than calibration remains to be studied.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>' line representation is adopted to ensure parametric continuity of the CPC model.
