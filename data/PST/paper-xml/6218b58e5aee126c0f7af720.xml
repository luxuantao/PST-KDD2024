			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>There exist complex interactions among a large number of latent factors behind the decision making processes of different individuals, which drive the various user behavior patterns in recommender systems. These factors hidden in those diverse behaviors demonstrate highly entangled patterns, covering from high-level user intentions to low-level individual preferences. Uncovering the disentanglement of these latent factors can benefit in enhanced robustness, interpretability, and controllability during representation learning for recommendation. However, the large degree of entanglement within latent factors poses great challenges for learning representations that disentangle them, and remains largely unexplored in literature. In this paper, we present the SEMantic MACRo-mIcro Disentangled Variational Auto-Encoder (SEM-MacridVAE) model for learning disentangled representations from user behaviors, taking item semantic information into account. Our SEM-MacridVAE model achieves macro disentanglement by inferring the high-level concepts associated with user intentions (e.g., to buy a pair of shoes or a laptop) through a prototype routing mechanism, as well as capturing the individual preferences with respect to different concepts separately. The micro disentanglement is guaranteed through a micro-disentanglement regularizer stemming from an information-theoretic interpretation of VAEs, which forces each dimension of the representations to independently reflect an isolated low-level factor (e.g., the size or the color of a shirt). The semantic information including visual and categorical signals extracted from candidate items is utilized to further boost the recommendation performance of the proposed SEM-MacridVAE model. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to achieve significant improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines. We also show that the learned representations are interpretable and controllable, capable of potentially leading to a new paradigm for recommendation where users have fine-grained control over some target aspects of the recommendation candidates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Learning representations that can accurately reflect users' preference, based chiefly on user behavior, has been an important research focus for recommender systems since the advent of collaborative filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Despite the huge success in the past decade, existing user behavior-based representation learning methods, including the deep structure approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, generally ignore the complex interactions among the latent factors behind the users' decision-making processes. These latent factors can be highly entangled, ranging from macro concepts that govern the intention of a user in a particular behavior, to micro individual preferences at a granular level when implementing a specific intention. Existing methods fail to disentangle these latent factors, resulting in the fact that those learned representations may mistakenly preserve the confounding of the highly entangled factors, which leads to non-robustness and low interpretability.</p><p>Disentangled representation learning, which targets at learning factorized representations capable of uncovering and disentangling the latent explanatory factors hidden in the observed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, has recently attracted lots of attentions in the research community. Disentangled representations benefits in more robustness, i.e., less sensitive to the misleading correlations discovered in the limited observed training data. Besides, the enhanced interpretability brought by disentangled representation also finds direct application in recommendation-related tasks, such as transparent advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, customer-relationship management, and explainable recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> etc. Moreover, the controllability exhibited by many disentangled representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> can provide users with explicit controls over their desired recommendation results and offer them more interactive experience, which has great potential in driving a new paradigm for recommendation. However, the existing literature on disentangled representation learning mainly focuses on computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> rather than recommender systems.</p><p>User behaviors in recommender systems can be driven by both macro intentions and micro preferences, where macro intentions may involve high-level user intentions such as purchasing a pair of shoes or a laptop and micro preferences may refer to low-level user preferences such as the size or color of the shoes. Therefore, given that the above discrete relational user behavior data is essentially different from continuous image data, learning disentangled representations based on user behavior data for recommendation becomes largely unexplored and poses two challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The macro intentions and micro preferences co-exist in user behaviors, requiring the disentangled representation learning to separate these two levels of factors in a way that can preserve the hierarchical relations between high-level user intentions and lowlevel individual preferences under the intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The observed user behavior data, such as user-item ratings and user-item consumptions, are discrete and sparse in essence, differing themselves from continuous image data, which implies that the observed user behavior data is only associated with a very small number of entries in the high-dimensional representation space. This will be especially problematic when exploring the interpretability of a particular isolated dimension through varying the value of that dimension with other dimensions fixed.</p><p>To solve the challenges, we propose the SEMantic MACRo-mIcro Disentangled Variational Auto-Encoder (SEM-MacridVAE) model for learning disentangled representations based on user behavior with item semantic information being taken into consideration in this paper. Our proposed method explicitly models the separation of macro and micro factors when performing disentanglement at each level. In particular, macro disentanglement is achieved by discovering the high-level concepts associated with user intentions through a prototype routing mechanism, and separately capturing the individual preferences of a user with respect to different concepts. Micro disentanglement is strengthened through a micro-disentanglement regularizer derived from interpreting VAEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> in terms of an information-theoretic perspective, which aims at forcing each individual dimension to indicate an independent micro factor. The semantic information including visual and categorical signals from items is employed to further boost the model performances of the proposed SEM-MacridVAE model. To handle the conflict between sparse discrete user behavior observations and dense continuous latent representations, we propose a beam-search strategy for investigating the interpretability of each isolated dimension through finding a smooth trajectory within different representations.</p><p>We conduct extensive empirical experiments to show that our SEM-MacridVAE model can achieve significant improvement over several state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental results also demonstrate that the learned disentangled representations from SEM-MacridVAE can be interpretable and controllable, which may potentially bring a promising new paradigm for recommendation where users are given finegrained controls over target aspects of the recommendation candidates.</p><p>To summarize, this paper makes the following contributions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we review existing works on user behavior representation learning and disentangled representation learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Learning Representations from User Behavior</head><p>Learning from user behavior has been a central task of recommender systems since the advent of collaborative filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Being able to predict user preferences through uncovering complex and unexpected patterns hidden in users' past behaviors without any domain knowledge, factorization based recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> has become one of the most popular methods in recommender systems. These factorization based collaborative filtering models factorize user and item information into latent representations to approximate user preferences and item attributes, either in a deterministic way <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> or a probabilistic manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. In addition to early factorization based attempts, the more recent deep learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> achieve massive improvement by learning highly informative representations. The entanglement of the latent factors behind user behavior, however, is mostly neglected by the black-box representation learning process adopted by the majority of the existing methods. To the extent of our knowledge, we are the first to study disentangled representation learning on user behavior data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Disentangled Representation Learning</head><p>Disentangled representation learning aims to identify and disentangle the underlying explanatory factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Being  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> demonstrates that disentanglement can emerge once the KL divergence term in the VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> objective is aggressively penalized.</p><p>In particular, Kingma and Welling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> propose to utilize Bayesian posterior inference and variational estimation to learn the controllable factors hidden in the observed data. Higgins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> propose β − V AE by setting a weight β for the KL divergence to improve representation disentanglement learned in the observed data while sacrificing mutual information between input data and latent representations. Later approaches separate the information bottleneck term <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and the total correlation term, and achieve a greater level of disentanglement <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Other works either design an attentive architecture to learn aspect matrix for word embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or utilize methods based on triplets to learn aspect representations from sentences where each aspect has a separate encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Though a few existing approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> do notice that a dataset can contain samples from different concepts, i.e., follow a mixture distribution, their settings are fundamentally different from ours. To be specific, these existing approaches assume that each instance is from a concept, while we assume that each instance interacts with objects from different concepts. The majority of the existing efforts are from the field of computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Disentangled representation learning on relational data, such as graph-structured data, was not explored until recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. This work focuses on disentangling user behavior from both the macro intention and micro preference in recommender systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHOD</head><p>In this section, we describe our SEM-MacridVAE model for learning disentangled representations from user behaviors in detail, whose whole framework is demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Notations and Problem Formulation</head><p>A user behavior dataset D consists of the interactions between N users and M items. The interaction between the u th user and the i th item is denoted by x u,i ∈ {0, 1}, where x u,i = 1 indicates that user u explicitly adopts item i, whereas x u,i = 0 means there is no recorded interaction between the two. For convenience, we use x u = {x u,i : x u,i = 1} to represent the items adopted by user u. The goal is to learn user representations {z u } N u=1 that achieves both macro and micro disentanglement. We use θ to denote the set that contains all the trainable parameters of our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Macro Disentanglement</head><p>Users may have very diverse interests, and interact with items that belong to many high-level concepts, e.g., product categories. We aim to achieve macro disentanglement, by learning a factorized representation of user u, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">z u = [z (1) u ; z (2) u ; . . . ; z (K) u ] ∈ R d ′</formula><p>, where d ′ = Kd, assuming that there are K high-level concepts. The k th component z</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(k)</formula><p>u ∈ R d is for capturing the user's preference regarding the k th concept. Additionally, we infer a set of one-hot vectors C = {c i } M i=1 for the items, where c i = [c i,1 ; c i,2 ; . . . ; c i,K ]. If item i belongs to concept k, then c i,k = 1 and c i,k ′ = 0 for any k ′ ̸ = k. We infer {z u } N u=1 in an unsupervised way, and learn C in a supervised manner through the categorical signals of the semantic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Micro Disentanglement</head><p>High-level concepts correspond to the intentions of a user, e.g., to buy clothes or a cellphone. We are also interested in disentangling a user's preference at a more granular level regarding the various aspects of an item. For example, we would like the different dimensions of z</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(k)</formula><p>where the meanings of x u , z u , C are described in the previous subsection. We also assume that</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p θ (z u ) = p θ (z u | C)</formula><p>in Equation (1), i.e., z u and C are generated by two independent sources. Note that c i = [c i,1 ; c i,2 ; . . . ; c i,K ] is one-hot, since we assume that item i belongs to exactly one concept. We also remark that</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p θ (x u,i | z u , C) = Z −1 u • K k=1 c i,k • g (i) θ (z (k) u )</formula><p>is a categorical distribution over the M items, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Z u = M i=1 K k=1 c i,k • g (i) θ (z (k) u ),<label>and g (i) θ</label></formula><p>: R d → R + is a shallow neural network that estimates how much a user with a given preference is interested in item i. We use sampled softmax <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to estimate Z u based on a few sampled items when M is very large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Macro Disentanglement</head><p>We assume above that the user representation z u is sufficient for predicting how the user will interact with the items. And we further assume that using the k th component z (k) u alone is already sufficient if the prediction is about an item from concept k. This design explicitly encourages z (k) u to capture preference regarding only the k th concept, as long as the inferred concept assignment matrix C is meaningful.

Nevertheless, we note that p θ (C) requires careful design to prevent mode collapse, i.e., the degenerate case where almost all items are assigned to a single concept.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Micro Disentanglement</head><p>A natural strategy to encourage micro disentanglement is to force statistical independence between the dimensions, i.e., to force</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">q θ (z (k) u | C) ≈ d j=1 q θ (z (k) u,j | C),</formula><p>so that each dimension describes an isolated factor, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">q θ (z u | C) = q θ (z u | x u , C)p data (x u ) dx u .</formula><p>Fortunately, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the lower bound above does provide a way to encourage independence.

On the other hand, the former term I q (x u ; z u ) is the mutual information between x u and z u under q θ (z u | x u , C) • p data (x u ). Penalizing I q (x u ; z u ) is equivalent to applying the information bottleneck principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, which encourages z u to ignore as much noise in the input as it can and to focus on merely the essential information. We therefore follow β-VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and strengthen these two regularization terms by a factor of β ≫ 1, which brings us to the following training objective:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">E p θ (C) E q θ (zu|xu,C) ln p θ (x u | z u , C)<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">−β • D KL q θ (z u | x u , C)∥p θ (z u ) .</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Prototype-based Concept Assignment</head><p>A straightforward approach would be to assume p θ (C) = M i=1 p(c i ) and parameterize each categorical distribution p(c i ) with its own set of K − 1 parameters. This approach, however, would result in over-parameterization and low sample efficiency. We instead propose a prototype-based implementation. To be specific, we introduce K concept prototypes {m k } K k=1 and reuse the item representations {h i } M i=1 from the decoder. We then assume c i is a one-hot vector drawn from the following categorical distribution p θ (c i ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">c i ∼ CATEGORICAL SOFTMAX([s i,1 ; s i,2 ; . . . ; s i,K ]) , (6) s i,k = COSINE(h i , m k )/τ,</formula><p>where COSINE(a, b) = a ⊤ b/(∥a∥ 2 ∥b∥ 2 ) is the cosine similarity, and τ is a hyper-parameter that scales the similarity from</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">[−1, 1] to [− 1 τ , 1 τ ].</formula><p>We set τ = 0.1 to obtain a more skewed distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Preventing Mode Collapse</head><p>We use cosine similarity, instead of the inner product similarity adopted by most existing deep learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.

In fact, with inner product, the majority of the items are highly likely to be assigned to a single concept m k ′ that has an extremely large norm, i.e., ∥m k ′ ∥ 2 → ∞, even when the items {h i } M i=1 correctly form K clusters in the high-dimensional Euclidean space. And we observe empirically that this phenomenon does occur frequently with inner product (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3c</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4c</ref>). In contrast, cosine similarity avoids this degenerate case due to the normalization. Moreover, cosine similarity is related with the Euclidean distance on the unit hypersphere, and the Euclidean distance is a proper metric that is more suitable for inferring the cluster structure, compared to inner product.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Incorporating Semantic Information</head><p>In this section, we discuss the incorporation of semantic information extracted from items to further boost the model performance. Specifically, we consider two types of semantic information, i.e., visual signals and categorical signals.</p><p>Incorporating Visual Signals. The two key elements, i.e., concept prototypes {m k } K k=1 and item representations {h i } M i=1 , in the prototype mechanism which has a crucial influence on both encoder and decoder, are so far initialized randomly without taking any semantic information from items into consideration.</p><p>Therefore, to further improve the model performances, we encode visual semantic information through a pre-trained AlexNet over the raw item image to obtain visual feature v i for each item i. To match the dimension of v i with that of the item embedding, we conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on v i . Then we initialize h i with the lowdimensional visual feature conduct initialization for m k by calculating the cluster center (obtained from K-means) of item representations belonging to concept k. Concretely, the visual features are obtained from the output of the last second fully-connected layers of the AlexNet, which has five convolutional layers followed by three fully-connected layers and is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset with semantic categorical labels. Assuming the visual features output from AlexNet is denoted as {v i } M i=1 = AlexN et(•), then the process of initializing {h i } M i=1 and {m k } K k=1 can be formulated as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">vi = 1 M M i=1 v i ,<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">V = 1 M M i=1 (v i − vi )(v i − vi ) T , V = QΛQ T , P = Q T [: d], {h i } M i=1 = {P v i } M i=1 , {m k } K k=1 = Kmeans(h 1 , h 2 , • • • , h M )</formula><p>, where each column of Q represents an eigenvector of V and P contains d eigenvectors corresponding to the largest d eigenvalues.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Solution</head><p>Here we illustrate our approach to this task. We first probe the suitable range (a, b) for h * ,j . Let us assume that prototype k * is the prototype closest to h * . The range (a, b) is decided such that: prototype k * remains the prototype closest to h * if and only if h * ,j ∈ (a, b). We can decide each endpoint of the range using binary search. We then divide the range (a, b) into B subranges, a = a 0 &lt; a 1 &lt; a 2 . . . &lt; a B = b. We ensure that the subranges contain roughly the same number of items from concept k * when dividing (a, b) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Datasets</head><p>We conduct extensive experiments on five public real-world datasets, including a MovieLens dataset (i.e., ML-latestsmall) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and four Amazon product datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> of different meta categories (i.e., Movies&amp;TV, Musical Instruments, Home&amp;Kitchen and Clothing&amp;Shoes&amp;Jewelry 1 ). We follow MultiVAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and binarize these five datasets by labeling ratings of four or higher as 1, and keeping users who have at least fifteen rating actions. Each item in MovieLens and Amazon datasets is associated with its corresponding image, and we utilize an AlexNet pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to obtain 4096-dimension visual features which will then be transformed to a d-dimension latent factor to initialize item representation h of this item. Given that the ImageNet dataset contains semantic guidance for visual features through providing ground-truth labels for various types of images, in this way we are able to incorporate semantic information of each item into our learning process. All datasets are preprocessed using the script provided by MultiVAE. Half of the held-out users are used for validation, while the other half of the held-out users are for testing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Model Performance</head><p>We evaluate the performance of our approach on the task of collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, one of the most common settings for recommendation. We follow the experiment protocol established by the previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> strictly, as well as use the same preprocessing procedure and evaluation metrics. The results on the five datasets are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>.</p><p>We observe that our SEM-MacridVAE model outperforms the baseline methods significantly in all but one case for all datasets. The improvement is likely due to two desirable properties of our approach. Firstly, macro disentanglement not only allows us to accurately represent the diverse interests of a user using the different components, but also alleviates data sparsity by allowing a rarely visited item to borrow information from other items of the same category, which is the motivation behind many hierarchical methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Secondly, as we will later show in Section 4.4 that the dimensions of the representations learned by our approach are highly disentangled, i.e., independent, which should take credits from the micro disentanglement regularizer leading to more robust performances. This second property implies that our approach can be more robust to the scenario where multiple factors are co-influencing the data generating process, especially when there is a limited amount of available data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For example, it would not overreact to the preference for bag size when making a prediction that is only related with the preference for bag color.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussions</head><p>The ablation studies on the two-level (macro and micro) disentanglement and the semantic (visual and categorical) signals show the improvement of the model performance brought by these core components in our proposed SEM-MacridVAE model. On the one hand, the macro disentanglement helps to capture user high-level intentions from a diversity of potential interests, while the micro disentanglement targets at learning the user low-level preferences in a more fine-grained way. Taking both levels of intentions into consideration enables the proposed SEM-MacridVAE model to more accurately infer user interests, thus improving the final recommendation performance. On the other hand, incorporating the categorical signals can more accurately align the learned macro disentangled intentions (i.e., the prototype concepts) to the ground-truth item categories, thus leading to better representation learning. Moreover, employing the visual signals to initialize the item embeddings is able to ease the process of learning detailed user visual preferences (e.g., the color of a bag) for our SEM-MacridVAE model. These two types of semantic supervision are taken into account to improve both the disentanglement and explainability of SEM-MacridVAE with human prior, which is illustrated by the ablation studies in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> as we expect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Macro Disentanglement</head><p>In order that we can qualitatively examine to which degree our proposed SEM-MacridVAE model is able to achieve macro disentanglement, the high-dimensional representations learned by our approach are visualized on three Amazon datasets, i.e., Amazon Musical Instruments, Amazon Home&amp;Kitchen and Amazon Clothing&amp;Shoes&amp;Jewelry. We pick subsets from these three Amazon datasets respectively such that every item only belongs to one category, and the number of items in every category is balanced to be closed to each other. Concretely, we set K to 4 for Amazon Musical Instruments, 5 for Amazon Home&amp;Kitchen and 3 for Amazon Clothing&amp;Shoes&amp;Jewelry i.e., the number of ground-truth categories, when training our model. We then match each learned prototype to a ground truth category by greedily minimizing the distance between the prototype and the center of the items from that category. We visualize the item representations and the user representations together using t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, where we treat the K components of a user as K individual points and keep only the two components that have the highest confidence levels. The confidence of component k is defined as i:xu,i&gt;0 c i,k , where c i,k is the value inferred by our SEM-MacridVAE model rather than taken from the ground-truth.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4</ref> depict the visualization results on Amazon Musical Instruments, Amazon Home&amp;Kitchen and Amazon Clothing&amp;Shoes&amp;Jewelry respectively. Specifically, item i is colored according to arg max k c i,k , i.e., the inferred category. The discovered clusters of items (see Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4a</ref>), learned in an unsupervised manner, align well with the ground-truth categories (see Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4b</ref>, where the color order is chosen such that the connections between the ground-truth categories and the learned clusters are easy to verify). Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3c</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4c</ref> highlight the importance of using cosine similarity rather than inner product to combat mode collapse, where items are obtained by training a new model that uses inner product instead of cosine, colored according to the value of arg max k c i,k .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Interpretability</head><p>Again, we take the Amazon datasets as instances. Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4a</ref> show the clusters inferred based on the prototypes on Amazon Musical Instruments, Amazon Home&amp;Kitchen and Amazon Clothing&amp;Shoes&amp;Jewelry respectively, which are similar to Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4b</ref> showing the ground-truth categories respectively. Given that the proposed SEM-MacridVAE model is trained without the ground-truth category labels, we believe that our approach is able to discover and disentangle the macro structures underlying the user behavior data in an interpretable manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Cosine vs. Inner Product</head><p>To further present the necessity of adopting cosine similarity instead of the widely used inner product similarity, we train an additional model using inner product rather than cosine to calculate similarity. The item representations obtained from this additional model on Amazon Musical Instruments, Amazon Home&amp;Kitchen and Amazon Clothing&amp;Shoes&amp;Jewelry are visualized in Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3c</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4c</ref> respectively.</p><p>We observe that by adopting inner product as the similarity measure, the clustering results may vary for different datasets. The prototype assignments are similar on Amazon Musical Instruments (see Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>), while the majority of the items are assigned to the same prototype on Amazon Home&amp;Kitchen (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3c</ref>) or assigned to wrong prototypes different from the ground-truth prototypes on Amazon Clothing&amp;Shoes&amp;Jewelry (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4c</ref>). On the other hand, each of the prototypes learned by the cosine-based model is assigned quite a significant number of items, being consistent with the ground-truth categories (see Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4a</ref>).</p><p>These results support our claim that an appropriate metric space such as the one defined through the cosine similarity will play an important role in preventing the mode collapse problem.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Independence</head><p>One important motivation of disentangled representation learning is to achieve robust performance by letting the dimensions capture the underlying explanatory factors in a statistically independent way.</p><p>To gain further insight, we vary the hyper-parameters related with micro disentanglement, i.e., β for our proposed SEM-MacridVAE, MacridVAE and MultiVAE. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">5</ref>, we plot the relationships between the level of independence (micro disentanglement) achieved and the corresponding recommendation performance. Each method is evaluated on ML-latest-small, Amazon Musical Instruments, Amazon Movies&amp;TV, Amazon Home&amp;Kitchen and Amazon Clothing&amp;Shoes&amp;Jewelry. We quantify the level of independence achieved by a set of d-dimensional representations using 1− 2 d(d−1) 1≤i&lt;j≤d |corr i,j |, where corr i,j is the correlation between dimension i and j. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">5</ref> indicates that high performance is in general associated with a relatively high level of independence (micro disentanglement) and SEM-MacridVAE achieves a higher level of micro disentanglement than MultiVAE.</p></div>

The examples from these three datasets suggest that our SEM-MacridVAE model has the potential to offer users fine-grained controls over targeted aspects of the candidate items in recommendation lists. However, we note that not all dimensions are human-understandable.</p><p>Moreover, as is pointed out by Locatello et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, welltrained interpretable models can only be reliably identified with the help of external knowledge, e.g., item attributes.

We relate macro factors to high-level concepts associated with user intentions (buy a pair of shoes or a laptop) and micro factors to low-level individual user preferences (the size or the color of a shirt). Extra semantic item information, including visual semantic and categorical semantic, are further taken into consideration to boost recommendation performance. Empirical results including both quantitative and qualitative experiments over five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning disentangled representations that are robust, interpretable, and controllable.

The macro disentanglement is accomplished through learning a set of prototypes (macro concepts) based on which the user intention related with each item is inferred. Different colors (blue, yellow and green) in the figure indicate different macro concepts where each macro concept (one color) has one single independent prototype, encoder and decoder (with the same color). The micro disentanglement is achieved by capturing the preferences of the target user over different intentions separately, guaranteed by magnifying the KL divergence where a term penalizing the total correlation can be separated with a factor of β. Semantic information included categorical and visual signals extracted from candidate items is utilized to further improve model performance. In particular, visual signals are used to initialize the item factors and prototype representations, and categorical signals serve as the supervisions for learning macro concept C.</figDesc></figure>
