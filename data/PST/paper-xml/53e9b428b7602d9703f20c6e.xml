<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many dynamical systems involve not only process and measurement noise signals but also parameter uncertainty and known input signals. When LZ or E, filters that were designed based on a "nominal" model of the system are applied, the presence of parameter uncertainty will not only affect the noise attenuation property of the filter but also introduce a bias proportional to the known input signal, and the latter may be very appreciable. In this paper, we introduce a finitehorizon robust E, filtering method that provides a guaranteed E, bound for the estimation error in the presence of both parameter uncertainty and a known input signal. This method is developed by using a game-theoretic approach, and the results generalize those obtained for cases without parameter uncertainty or without a known input signal. It is also demonstrated, via an example, that the proposed method provides significantly improved signal estimates.</p></div>

INTRODUCTION</head><p>N contrast with the conventional C2 estimation algorithms I that minimize the variance of the estimation error (see, e.g., [ l]), recent advancement in signal estimation has focused on the development of E , estimation methods ([2]-[9],</p><p>[11]- <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>) that aim at minimizing the peak of the spectral density of the estimation error. The motivation for the ' FI , approach is that the statistical assumptions and information on the noise sources are often inaccurate, or unavailable, and also that the C2 estimation methods are sensitive to parameter variations in the signal process; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for a survey of the ' FI , estimation algorithms.</p><p>As in the Cz case, IH, filters are usually designed based on a "nominal" model of the signal process. For this reason, we shall refer to them as "nominal" IH, filters. Although the "nominal" 'FIm filter has been shown to be less sensitive to parameter variations in the signal process than the corresponding Cz filter (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> and Section II), no guaranteed performance is provided when the true signal process deviates from the assumed model.</p><p>To solve the above problem, a robust IH, filtering method has been developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and 1161 to guarantee a prescribed ' FI , performance in the presence of parameter un-Manuscript received March 18, 1993; revised <ref type="bibr">February 15, 1994</ref>. This work was supported by the Australian Research Council and the C. &amp; M. Maus Chair of Computer Systems Engineering at Tel-Aviv University, Israel.

Fu are with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, Australia.</p><p>U. Shaked is with the Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.</p><p>IEEE Log Number 9408228.</p><p>certainty. It will be demonstrated, via an example, in Section I1 that such a robust IH, filter far outperforms the corresponding "nominal" IH, and the C2 filters.</p><p>The focal point of this paper is to address the robust ' FI , filtering problem for signal processes with both parameter uncertainty and a known input signal. Note that if the signal process does not involve parameter uncertainties, it is well known that for both C2 and IHm filters the existence of a known input does not affect the estimation error, i.e., the contribution of the known input signal can be completely cancelled (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, [ 111). This significant feature is, however, no longer valid in the presence of uncertain parameters. As a result, the estimation error will have, in general, components due to both the process and the measurement noise signals and the known system input. In Section 11, we shall show, via an example, that the second component may be far more appreciable than the first one, when the filter is designed based on the nominal values of the parameters.</p><p>In this paper, we generalize the robust IH, filtering approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> to cope with the case where the process has a known input signal. The goal of the filter is to provide a uniformly small estimation error for any process and measurement noise signals and for any initial state in the presence of parameter uncertainty and a known input signal. The problem will be solved in the finite-horizon setting. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, one of the key ideas is to convert the parameter uncertainty into a fictitious C2 noise signal and to formulate an auxiliary problem that does not involve any parameter uncertainty. It will be shown that the solution to the auxiliary problem, if it exists, guarantees, when applied to the original problem, a prescribed performance in an IH, sense. A game-theoretic approach is used to solve the auxiliary problem, which gives a solution in terms of Riccati differential equations. Three types of input signals are considered: causal, causal with known average, and noncausal. Causal signals are those that can be measured but not predicted, whereas noncausal signals are known a priori. Different filters are derived for the three cases.</p><p>The results of this paper will be demonstrated in an example that illustrates the significant improvement that can be achieved in signal estimation with the new technique.</p><p>It should be noted that the filtering methodology of this paper resolves one of the major difficulties that was encountered with IH, filtering, namely, the filter design in presence of measurable disturbances. This difficulty is easily resolved by the theory of this paper by considering the measured part of the disturbances as a known input signal. </p></div>

Both infinite horizon Kalman and "nominal" 'Hm filters are designed for the nominal system that has been chosen to correspond to S = 0. These filters are of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2 ( t ) = [O 100]i(t)</formula><p>with M = [0 1001, where 2 ( t ) is the estimate of z ( t ) and K is the filter gain. For the Kalman filter design, the noise sources w ( t ) and v(t) were assumed to be uncorrelated, zeromean, white signals with unit power spectrum density. The corresponding filter gain is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">K = K K = [0.447 0.9091T.</formula><p>For the "nominal" ' H , filter design, we take y = 1.1 = 0.8 dB and design the filter to achieve Ilell2 &lt; r[llwll; + ll~ll;lf where e ( t ) denotes the estimation error z ( t ) -i ( t ) .

From these figures, we make the following observations: Gev(jw)] and Ge,(jw) are worsened for both designs when the parameter uncertainty exists (note that G,,(s) 0 when there is no parameter uncertainty).</p><p>2) The magnitude of G,,(jw), which is identically zero in the absence of parametric uncertainty, may be far more significant than that of [G,,(jw) Gev(jw)] for both designs, even in the case of a moderate T-.</p><p>3) The Kalman filter is more sensitive to changes in the parameter S than the "nominal" ' H , filter. Based on the above observations, there is a need to consider the uncertainty in the design procedure, and a more robust filter design methodology needs to be developed.</p><p>For the case where there is no deterministic input signal, i.e., r ( t ) = 0, a robust ' H , filtering theory has been developed to cope with parameter uncertainty (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and [16]).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. AN EXAMPLE</head><p>We consider the example in Section I1 and will show that a filter designed by using the proposed robust ' FI , filtering method will yield much more satisfactory signal estimates, i.e., improved robustness properties, compared to the Kalman and standard ' FIm filters based on the nominal model. The uncertainty in this example is of the form (3.4H3.5) with</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">HI = [0.3 OIT, H2 = 0, E = [O 11.</formula><p>Since the simulation of Section I1 is for the infinite horizon case, we apply below the theory of Sections 111 and IV for a very large T.

Obviously, this filter performs far better than the Kalman filter and the "nominal" ' FIm filter in Section 11. It is observed that the improvement for G,,(s) is more significant in the low-frequency range than in the mid frequencies. This is because our design was done for constant r and steady-state.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">q t ) = i ( t ) = [ 0.</formula><p>It is worth noting that the function G,,(s) for the filter (5.6)-(5.7) is actually identical to that of the robust filter (2.4)- <ref type="bibr">(2.6)</ref> in Section I1 where T is not considered. This is natural because the auxiliary filtering problem <ref type="bibr">(3.14)</ref> is identical to the one in [61 when T 0, 20 = 0, and R -+ oc. For comparison purposes, we finally consider an altemative method for designing G,,(s), which we call the cancellation method. The idea is simply as follows: Because G,(s) only effects Ge,(s), it is therefore obvious that the role of G,(s) is to minimize G,,(s) in a certain sense. One possibility is to choose GT(s) such that G,,(s) is completely cancelled, i.e., G,,(s) 0 for the nominal model. However, we show using the above example that such a method may not give an optimal worst-case solution. This observation is made from the dotted curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">5</ref> that correspond to the magnitude spectrum of GeT( s), resulting from the cancellation method for different values of S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>vr. CONCLUSION</head><p>A new robust ' FIm filtering method has been developed via a game theoretic approach for systems with both parametric uncertainty and a known input signal in the finite time horizon setting. The solution to the robust ' FI , filtering involves two Riccati differential equations with a scaling parameter. The robust ' Hfilter contains two components, one for process and measurement noise attenuation and the other for the attenuation of the known input signal. The former turns out to be the same as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which treated the case without known input signal, but the latter depends on the a priori information on the extemal signal. The simulation of the results in an example has demonstrated that the proposed robust filtering method offers far better robustness, and hence performance, than the conventional C2 and ' FI , filtering, for both noise and bias attenuation.</p><p>We expect that this new method can also be applied to the following problems: i) robust C2 filtering with parametric uncertainty and ii) robust tracking for systems with parametric uncertainty.</p><p>known input signal</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
