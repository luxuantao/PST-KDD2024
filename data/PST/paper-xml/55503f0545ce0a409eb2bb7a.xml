<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Global path planning of mobile robot in a static environment is one of the most important problems in the field of mobile robot. Biogeography-based Optimization (BBO) is a relative new algorithm inspired by biogeography. It mainly uses the biogeography-based migration operator to share the information among solutions. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a classical heuristic search method whose mechanics are inspired by the swarming or collaborative behavior of biological populations. This paper presents a new method of global path planning by combining BBO, PSO and approximate voronoi boundary network (AVBN) in a static environment. The idea of this paper is to apply position updating strategy of PSO to increase the diversity of population in BBO and then use the obtained biogeography particle swarm optimization algorithm (BPSO) to optimize the paths in path network obtained by AVBN modeling. Experimental results in simulation show that the proposed method is feasible and effective.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Robot path planning (RPP) is a key issue in autonomous robot technology. The basic RPP problem deals with static environments, that is, workspaces solely containing stationary obstacles. RPP is also an important problem in navigation of autonomous mobile robots, which is to find an optimal collision-free path from a starting point to a goal in a given environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>There have been various methods proposed by researchers to solve RPP problems. Methods in RPP can be divided into the following two methods. The first method is based on environment information directly. Though such a method has a good adaptability to the changes of environment, it is difficult to find an ideal path under complex environment. So it is generally adopted in the local path planning. The second method is based on a structured model. The structured model embodies the typical character of the environment and can help to decrease the calculation of path planning.</p><p>Many conventional path planning methods, such as cell decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, roadmaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have difficulty in solving RPP with complex environments due to their high cost of computation. Approximate voronoi boundary network (AVBN) is a structured method that obtains the non-smooth path network from the sensors in formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It needs not decompose the complex obstacles, so the model of the environment is simplified. Such a method embodies the network structure of the free area of environment with less nodes, so the complexity of path planning problem is reduced largely.</p><p>In recent years, we have seen that many intelligent optimization approaches inspired by natural phenomenon or mechanisms had been used for RPP due to their robust and abilities of parallel computing. Genetic algorithm and neural networks, both of which are well known intelligent optimization approaches, had been used for solving RPP many years ago. Sugihara et al. had adopted a genetic algorithm to solve the problem based on cell representation of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Gemeinder et al. presented a genetic algorithm (GA)-based path planning software for mobile robot systems focusing on energy consumption. AL-Taharwa et al. presented genetic algorithm to help a controllable mobile robot to find an optimal path between starting and ending point in a grid environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Mohanta et al. used petri-GA for path planning strategy of autonomous mobile robot navigation.Yang et al. applied a neural network to program the collision-free path of a mobile robot in a dynamic environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Xiong et al. proposed a RPP method based on recurrent neural network <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Besides the classical intelligent approaches mentioned above, Bell and McMullen had used ant colony algorithm, a well known swarming intelligence approach, to solve RPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A novel method for the real-time globally optimal path planning of mobile robots is proposed based on the ant colony system (ACS) algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Another well known swarm intelligence method-particle swarm optimization (ACO) had also been utilized to solve RPP problem. Saska et al. used PSO to optimized the parameters of splines, which was a path description approach proposed by the authors Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/neucom <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Chen et al.proposed an improved PSO to optimize the path of a mobile robot through an environment containing static obstacles <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. It can get smooth path. Lu et al. used particle swarm optimization, another well known swarm intelligence method to solve RPP in unknown environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The other intelligent algorithms used in RPP include artificial immunes systems, which are the intelligent approaches inspired by immunology theories and mechanisms of human immune system also applied in RPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Culture algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, memetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and simulation annealing algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> had also been used for RPP.</p><p>Each method has its own advantage over others in certain aspects. So, a hybrid technique based on ACO and fuzzy system was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the problem of finding the optimal collision free path in complex environments for a mobile robot is solved using a hybrid neural network, GA and a local search method.</p><p>Generally speaking, the main difficulties for RPP problems are computational complexity, local optimum and adaptability, so researchers have always been seeking alternative and more efficient ways to solve the problem.</p><p>PSO was invented by Kennedy and Eberhart in the mid 1990s while attempting to simulate the choreographed, graceful motion of swarms of birds as part of a sociocognitive study investigating the notion of 'collective intelligence' in biological populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In PSO, a set of randomly generated solutions (initial swarm) propagates in the design space towards the optimal solution over a number of iterations (moves) based on a large amount of information about the design space that is assimilated and shared by all members of the swarm. It seems to be an attractive one to study since it has a simple but efficient nature added to being novel. It can even be a substitution for other basic and important evolutionary algorithms.</p><p>Recently, the science of biogeography had been paid attention by researchers from computer science. BBO is a bio-inspired optimization technique inspired by biogeography <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Over the past three years, many improvement to BBO had been finished by Simon and some other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Bhattacharya et al. used BBO to solve the problem of economic load dispatch problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. We have used BBO to successfully solve the problem of traveling salesman problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. BBO is a new intelligent algorithm which shows good performance in many respects.</p><p>In the following sections, we design a new RPP method by combining BBO and PSO. In order to calculate the trajectory in the global map, this paper presents a new RPP method based on the combination of BPSO and AVBN method. The biogeography based particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to search the possible paths and the best one is obtained.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the basic BBO and PSO algorithm are introduced and then BPSO is proposed. In Section 3, we combine BPSO and AVBN to solve the RPP. Simulation results and analysis are shown in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Biogeopraphy-based optimization</head><p>In BBO, each possible solution is an island and their features that characterize habitability are called suitability index variables (SIV). The goodness of each solution is called its habitat suitability index (HSI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. A habitat is a vector of SIVs initialized randomly and then follows migration and mutation step to reach global minima. For solving an engineering problem, a good solution is analogous to an island with a high HSI, and a poor solution represents an island with a low HSI. High HSI solutions resist change more than low HSI solutions. By the same token, high HSI solutions tend to share their features with low HSI solutions. Poor solutions accept a lot of new features from good solutions. In BBO, a population of candidate solutions is represented as vectors of integers. Each integer in the solution vector is considered to be an SIV.</p><p>The main feature of BBO differs from the other evolutionary computation lies in its migration strategy or migration operation. In BBO, each individual has its own emigration rate λ s and immigration rate μ s , which are functions of the number of species s; ðs ¼ 1; 2:::i; :::PÞ in the habitat and can be expressed by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">λ s ¼ E s P<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">μ s ¼ I 1 À s P<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where E ¼ maxλ s , I ¼ maxμ s , and P ¼ population size. Generally, E and I are unit matrix. Let us consider the probability P s that the habitat contains exactly s species. The probabilities of each species count can be calculated using the differential Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P : s ¼ Àðλ s þ μ s ÞP s þ μ s þ 1 P s þ 1 ; s ¼ 0 Àðλ s þ μ s ÞP s þ λ s À 1 P s À 1 þ μ s þ 1 P s þ 1 ; 1 r s os max À 1 Àðλ s þ μ s ÞP s þ λ s À 1 P s À 1 ; s ¼ s max 8 &gt; &lt; &gt; :<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where s max is the maximal number of species count.</p><p>In migration process, the information shared among habitats is depended on λ s and μ s of each solution. Migration strategy is described as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>:</p><p>Step In the migration procedure, each habitat (candidate solution) is modified based on other habitats. If a given habitat is selected to be modified, then its immigration rate λ i is used to probabilistically decide whether or not to modify each suitability index variable (SIV) in that habitat. If a given SIV in a given habitat H i is selected to be modified, then the emigration rates μ i of the other habitats are used to probabilistically decide which of the habitats should migrate a randomly selected SIV to solution.</p><p>Based on the process of migration, the adaptive ability of habitat is improved by regulating immigration rate and emigration rate, migration topology, and migration strategy. Thus, it can get optimal solution of problem. The main characteristic of BBO is that the original population does not disappear in each generation, but improve the fitness by migration, and it can decide migration rate by fitness.</p><p>After migration process, the mutation is used to increase the diversity of the population to get better solutions. Mutation operator changes a habitat's SIV randomly based on mutation rate m i . The mutation rate m i is expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">m i ¼ P mute 1 À P s P max<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where P max ¼ arg max P s ; i ¼ 1; :::; P:P mute is a parameter deciding mutation rate. Suppose that G is maximum number of generation. The procedure of BBO is as follows:</p><p>Step 1: Initialize parameters:P,G,P mute Step 2: Evaluate the fitness for each individual in P Step 3: While the termination criteria is not met do Step 4: Save the best habitats in a temporary array Step 5: For each habitat, map the HSI to number of species s, λ i and μ i according to (1) and (2)</p><p>Step 6: Probabilistically choose the immigration island based on the immigration rates Step 7: Migrate randomly selected SIVs based on the selected island in <ref type="bibr">Step 6</ref> Step 8: Mutate the worst half of the population according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> Step 9: Evaluate the fitness for each individual in P Step 10: Sort the population from best to worst Step 11:G ¼ G þ1</p><p>Step 12: End while</p></div>

Within the defined problem space, the system has a population of particles. Each particle is randomized with a velocity and flies in the search space. The velocities and positions of the particles are constantly updated until they have all reached the target.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Environment modeling</head><p>The RPP problem considered in this section is in a known static environment. And the robot possesses the information of the target and the obstacles being detected during the path planning. In RPP, the goal is to find the safest and shortest path, at same time, keeping as far away from obstacles as possible. To reach this aim, a Voronoi diagram of the obstacle boundaries may be constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Considering a 2-dimensional environment, the mobile robot is regarded as a point. The working area is divided into 400 Â 400 grids environment. Each grid is corresponding to a small area in real environment. The distribution of obstacles in the environment is represented by integer matrix 400 Â 400. The value indicates the obstacle grid, and the value 0 indicates the free grid.</p></div>

At first, the obstacle grid is enlarged to its neighbor grids, so some small obstacle clusters are fused to an integrated obstacle block. The scale of obstacle pre-enlargement should involve the consideration of not only the safe traversing radius of mobile robot, but also the error of sensors and positioning. The algorithm checks obstacle blocks and labels them. Every grid of the same obstacle block is 1abeled in the same number. The working area is assumed being surrounded by a rectangular obstacle.</p><p>3.1.2.1. Raster based enlargement of obstacles. The obstacle cluster is the kernel of enlargement. Free-grid is eroded by its neighboring obstacle grid. Every obstacle cluster grows up uniformly after one enlargement.

A grid will be labeled as a boundary grid if the upside grid or right grid is not at the same value as itself.

A boundary grid and its neighboring grids are integrated as one Voronoi node if the neighboring grids belong to three or more than three different areas (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(d)</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Global path planning</head><p>The AVBN method can establish the feasible paths network of mobile robot. Thus, it can transfer the path planning problem into the shortest path between two route nodes in network. According to the connecting relation in the network, a distance matrix can be establised as follows. In the distance matrix, in order to avoid searching the same route nodes repeatly, the distance between diagonal is set to infinite.</p><p>A mobile robot should search the shortcut to the network when it plans to move from a start point to a destination point. From the start point S and the destination point Q, search the shortest distance point in AVBN individually, and the intersection is named start node (node 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and end node (node 15 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). For example, from the start point, search the intersecting points on the network in every direction and chose the point as the start node which has the shortest distance to the start point. The end node is searched out in the same way. Calculating the cost of each branch, then the correlated nodes table of the network can be obtained.</p><p>The correlated nodes table in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> is listed as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L 1 ¼ f2; 8g; l 1 ¼ 2; L 2 ¼ f1; 3; 5g; l 2 ¼ 3; L 3 ¼ f2; 4; 7g; l 3 ¼ 3; L 4 ¼ f3</formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">l 14 ¼ 3; L 15 ¼ f10; 13g; l 15 ¼ 2:</formula><p>where l j is the element number in L j ; jA ½1; 15.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The AVBN based BPSO path planning algorithm</head><p>The path is a curve obtained by enlarging obstacles, so the best path in AVBN is not certain in reality. So we need to find a group of ideal paths in AVBN, then reoptimize them in vector space and select the best one according to the Euclid distance. We adopts BPSO to so1ve the problem. The algorithm is explained according to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. In the path planning, the series of route nodes is set as a  habitat of BPSO, that is, an individual. The AVBN based BPSO path planning algorithm is as follows:</p><p>Step 1: Initialize parameters: P,G,P mute ,w; c 1 ; c 2 .</p><p>Step 2: Encoding Each SIV in a habitat corresponds to a route node in AVBN. Consider the optimal path should not contain the same route node, so the length of encoding is less and equal to the number of network route nodes. The starting point is the number 1 route node, so the length of encoding is Node À 1. For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, the set of network route nodes is: Q ¼ f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15g. The length of habitat is 14.SIV value of a habitat G i is any integral number of Q, where G j ¼ fg 1 ; g 2 ; :::g,g j A Q , jA ½1; 15. In the process of network modeling, the distance matrix is obtained. And we can get the candidate connecting list of route nodes.</p><p>Step 3: Decoding In this step, the value g j of SIV is mapped to a route node. Here, L j ½m is the mth node of L j in correlated nodes table. Assuming s j is a node selected to be one of the route nodes, then the next node is: s j þ 1 ¼ L j ½m, where m is the sequence number in L j ; and the decoding rule is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">m ¼ MODðg j ; l j Þþ1<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where MODðg j ; l j Þ is the reminder of g j divided by l j . When a route node is selected to one of the path nodes, it will be deleted from all correlated nodes table for avoiding being reselected. This operation continues till we get a solution S.</p><p>Step 4: Mapping of emigration and immigration rates After decoding the habitat, the cost of every branch of AVBN is calculated by adding up at the grids on path between every two nodes based on the obtained route. The sum of the distance between two nodes of a route and the punishing cost is the  total cost of a habitat. That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">CðG i Þ ¼ CðS i Þ ¼ ∑ N i ¼ 1 D s i ;s i þ 1 þ kα<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where k ¼ 1, if the habitat is useless, else k ¼ 0;α is the punishment, N is the path node number of S i .</p><p>After the costs of all habitats are obtained, sort habitats in descending order. The order number of each habitat is considered as species s in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>). So we get the emigration and immigration rates.</p><p>Step 5: Record the previous best position of each habitat P i and their neighborhood best position P g .</p><p>Step 6: Migration The obtained emigration and immigration rates of each solution are used to probabilistically share information between habitats.</p><p>If a given solution is selected to be modified, then we use its immigration rate to probabilistically decide whether or not to modify each suitability index variable (SIV) in that solution. If a SIV in a solution is selected to be modified, then the emigration rates of the other solutions are used to probabilistically decide which of them should assign a SIV in it to replace the selected SIV in the solution.</p><p>For example, suppose G 3 and G 10 are selected according to the migration process, that is, G 3 is the habitat with few species (high cost, low HSI, and poor solution) has low μ and high λ, while G 10 habitat with more species (low cost, high HSI, and good solution) high μand low λ in population in a generation. The immigration process of two selected paths is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. After the migration process, G 3 is modified to be G' 3 ¼ f1; 5; 6; 13; 5; 8; 9; 6; 12; 11; 14; 4; 15; 3; 8; 3g, while G 10 is not changed at the same time. But it maybe selected to be modified in next iteration.</p><p>After the migration process is finished, some habitats will be modified, and the others will not. All of them are combined together as a population to the mutation process. If no solution is selected to be modified, the position of current habitat is updated according to (5).</p><p>Step 7: Mutation</p><p>The costs of generated habitats after migration are recalculated and sort these habitats in descending order of their costs. Only the worst half of the habitats population is mutated based on mutation ratem i (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>)), randomly generated SIV (route node) is used to replace a SIV in G i .</p><p>After the mutation process, the costs of generated habitats are recalculated and sort these habitats in descending order of their costs. The best two habitats are kept to the next iteration.</p><p>The cycle is ended when there is no best habitat emerging after some generations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Grid environments</head><p>In order to analyze the performance of BPSO in the path planning based on AVBN mode, we design three grid environments for the performance comparison of algorithms and compare BPSO with BBO, Genetic Algorithm(GA), and PSO on the same problems.</p><p>Three grid environments are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> (a)-(c).The black blocks are obstacles. The white area is free grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Parameters setting</head><p>The setting of parameters is as follows. BBO: P mod ¼1, P mute ¼0.005. GA: crossover rate¼ 0.9, mutation rate¼0.01. PSO: inertia w ¼0.9, c 1 and c 2 ¼2. Besides the parameters above, the number of initial population is 100. The maximal iteration generation number is 100. The tests represented in this paper consist of 100 trials. This test evaluates the efficiency and stability of shortest path planning with BPSO and gives a reference for evaluating the performance in partially modeled and unknown environments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Simulation results and analysis</head><p>The best paths of three grid environments by BPSO are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(a)-(c), respectively.</p><p>The best solutions of problems 1, 2 and 3 are 144,153 and 122 respectively. The values of best, worst, mean and standard variance of algorithms after 50 runs are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, we can see that BPSO can find the optimal path for all problems. The performance of BPSO is superior to BBO and PSO. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, the success rates of the four algorithms are shown. Success rate is the proportion of failure trail times and the total trail times.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, the success rates of trials of the four algorithms are shown. It can be seen that BPSO has the highest success rates for the three problems.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>(a)-(c), the convergence of the four algorithms in one trial are shown. It can be seen that BPSO has the best results for the three problems.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>(a)-(c), it is clear that PSO is not good at solving the given RPP problems. The migration strategy of BPSO is more effective than PSO in solving the given problems. For problem3, both BBO and BPSO can easily find the solution at the beginning. It can be seen that BPSO has better performance than the other three algorithms in total for the three RPP problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a new robot path planning approach, which combines a new hybrid optimization algorithm BPSO and approximate voronoi boundary network. The process of environment modeling is introduced. And then we use the modified BPSO to find a best path based on AVBN. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient for the given RPP problems. It has much faster convergence speed and higher success rates than the compared algorithms. It provides a new approach for solving RPP by intelligent optimization. In further study, we will try to use BPSO to solve RPP in more complex static environment, such as multi-objective RPP and also dynamic environment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
