We take an information-theoretic view of some simple protocols for reliable packet communication based on "Hybrid-ARQ," over a slotted multiple-access Gaussian channel with fading and study their throughput (total bit per second per hertz) and average delay under idealized but fairly general assumptions. As an application of the renewal-reward theorem, we obtain closed-form throughput formulas. Then, we consider asymptotic behaviors with respect to various system parameters. The throughput of automatic retransmission request (ARQ) protocols is compared to that of code division multiple access (CDMA) with conventional decoding. Interestingly, the ARQ systems are not interference-limited even if no multiuser detection or joint decoding is used, as opposed to conventional CDMA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N order to support new services (e.g., wireless mobile access to the Internet), next-generation wireless communication systems will implement packet-oriented data transmission in addition to standard mobile telephony <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. This implies bursty sporadic communication from a large population of users, that may require instantaneous large data rates and very small error probabilities for a short time. Motivated by the above consideration, we take an information-theoretic view of some simple protocols for reliable packet communication based on "Hybrid-ARQ," i.e., on combining channel coding and Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Several types of Hybrid-ARQ protocols have been proposed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and references therein). The throughput of ARQ schemes can be improved by packet combining, i.e., by keeping the erroneous received packets and using them for detection. Packet combining can be based on hard decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> or on soft channel outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. In the latter case, several noisy observations of the same packet obtained by retransmission are combined by a suitable diversity technique (e.g., maximal-ratio, equal-gain, or selection combining <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>). Soft decoding of maximal-ratio combined packets can be seen as an elementary form of Hybrid-ARQ, based on soft decoding of a repetition code of variable length. This idea can be extended to more general classes of codes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, rate compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes are used in an incremental redundancy ARQ scheme. Transmission starts with the highest rate code of the RCPC code family and additional redundancy bits are requested whenever necessary. More recently, turbo codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have been suggested as candidates for packet combining, exploiting the fact that they are systematic and produce incremental redundancy by puncturing the parity bits <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Analysis of Hybrid-ARQ protocols in terms of throughput, error rates, and delay can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Most works carry out a "separated analysis," i.e., consider a completely symmetric system with respect to any user, and study the behavior of the protocol for a particular reference user modeled as a Markov chain. In general, analysis depends on the type of codes and decoding/error detection technique employed. Modeling the system by a Markov chain might be complicated, since in each state one must convey all the information about the memory of the system. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, Zorzi proposes the use of renewal theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> in order to analyze ARQ protocols.</p><p>As remarkably well illustrated by Ephremides in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, information-theoretic techniques are not yet of widespread use in the domain of networking with random user activity. Steps in this direction are represented by the work of Shamai and Wyner on cellular systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and of Telatar and Gallager <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the multiple-access Gaussian channel is assimilated to a processor-sharing system and is analyzed as a queue with single server and an infinite buffer. The required service for each user is defined in terms of random coding bound on the error probability. A code-independent analysis of the mean transmission duration is obtained as an application of Little's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>This paper was mainly inspired by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. We assume that users transmit their signal bursts at high instantaneous power and in a completely uncoordinated way. The receiver is formed by a bank of single-user decoders, and does not implement joint decoding, i.e., each decoder treats the signals from other users as noise. 1 We refer to this model as the Gaussian collision channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The transmission of each user is governed by an Hybrid-ARQ protocol, designed to cope with background noise, fading, and interference (or "collisions") from other users.</p><p>We study the system performance in terms of throughput (total bit per second per hertz) and average delay for three 1 Even though any point in the capacity region of multiple-access channels can be implemented with low complexity by successive "stripping" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, this requires a good deal of coordination among the users which must allocate their rate and power in a proper way <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and may not be suited to random user activity.</p><p>simple idealized protocols: a coded version of Aloha, a repetition scheme with maximal-ratio packet combining, and an incremental redundancy scheme with general coding. By applying the renewal-reward theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, we obtain a closed-form throughput formula under a delay constraint (timeout) and code rate constraint. Since we consider random coding and typical set decoding, our results are independent of the particular coding/decoding technique and should be regarded as a limit in the information-theoretic sense.</p><p>The system throughput is compared to that of code division multiple access (CDMA) with conventional single-user detection and decoding. Interestingly, the ARQ system is not interference-limited even if no multiuser detection or joint decoding is used, i.e., arbitrarily high throughput can be obtained simply by increasing the transmit power of all users, as opposed to conventional CDMA, where the throughput tends to a finite limit as all users increase their transmit power <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. As a byproduct of this analysis, we provide a stronger operational meaning to the information outage probability of block-fading channels and we obtain the closed-form probability distribution of signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) with Rayleigh fading and a Poisson-distributed number of interferers, extending the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the system model; in Section III, we deal with typical set decoding and error detection; in Section IV, we carry out system throughput analysis; in Section V, we present some limiting behaviors; and in Section VI, we point out our conclusions. The proofs of the results are provided in the Appendixes A-D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE SLOTTED GAUSSIAN COLLISION CHANNEL WITH FEEDBACK</head><p>In the system under investigation, users share a common radio channel with complex baseband equivalent bandwidth in order to transmit their information messages to a single receiver. Users are provided with a common time reference. The time axis is divided in slots of duration and users transmit signal bursts of duration slightly less than , aligned with the slots. Apart from the slotted transmission mode, users are completely uncoordinated. Each user can transmit about independent complex symbols over one slot (assuming <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>). A discrete-time signal model is adopted and slots are denoted by their index . Let and denote the received signal, the transmitted signal from user , and the background noise during slot , respectively. Noise is assumed circularly symmetric complex Gaussian, with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) components with vari-ance . User transmits with constant average energy per symbol . The propagation channel is assumed slowly time varying and frequency flat for each user. In particular, the complex channel gain of user over slot is assumed to be constant on the whole slot (block fading <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). The received signal over slot can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where denotes the set of active users over slot .</p><p>User encodes its information messages, of bits each, independently of other users, by using a channel code with codebook of length over the complex numbers, where is a given integer. Codewords are divided into subblocks of length , each of which is modulated into a signal burst and is transmitted over one slot. We let , for denote the punctured code of length obtained from by deleting the last subblocks. Each user selects the slots for transmission according to its own time-hopping (pseudo)random sequence, independently of the other users <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Time-hopping sequences can be seen as random "on-off" processes, where a user can transmit only when it is "on." We assume that the receiver knows a priori the time-hopping rule of all users in the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref>Transmission is governed by the following simple Hybrid-ARQ protocol, run in a decentralized way by each user . When a new codeword is ready for transmission, user sends the first symbols on the first allowed slot, say , according to its time-hopping rule. The receiver decodes the code by processing the received signal . If decoding is successful, a positive acknowledgment (ACK) is sent back to user over an error-and delay-free feedback channel and the transmission of the current codeword stops. On the contrary, if the receiver detects an error, a negative acknowledgment (NACK) is sent. In this case, user sends the second block of symbols of the same codeword on the next allowed slot, say . Now, the receiver decodes the code by processing the received signal blocks . Again, if decoding is successful an ACK is sent and the transmission of the current codeword stops. On the contrary, if a decoding error is detected, a NACK is sent back and user transmits the third block of symbols of the same codeword on the next allowed slot. The process goes on this way: after the transmission of bursts of the current codeword, code is decoded by processing the received signal</p><p>, where denotes the sequence of slots where transmission of user took place. If successful decoding occurs at the th transmission, the effective coding rate for the current codeword is bits per second per hertz (b/s/Hz), where . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref>In general, the slots are nonadjacent. We let denote the delay (expressed in number of slots) between the instant where a codeword is generated and the current time (time ticks at the slot rate). Obviously, (see example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In any practical application, an information message must be delivered to the receiver within a maximum delay of slots, where for simplicity is assumed common to all users and all messages. If successful decoding does not occur within delay , the message becomes useless. Moreover, since the codewords of have subblocks, the same message can be transmitted in at most signal bursts. If successful decoding does not occur within transmitted bursts, the message is lost. We shall refer to and as the "delay" and "rate" constraints, respectively. The transmission of a codeword can stop in three cases. i) Successful decoding occurs at the th transmitted burst and in slots, with and . ii) No successful decoding occurs after transmitted bursts and slots. ii) No successful decoding occurs after slots and transmitted bursts.</p><p>There are several ways to handle transmission failures (cases ii) and iii) above). For example, in the case of time-sensitive information, the current message is simply discarded. In other applications, delay is not a strict requirement ( is very large) and the current message may be kept in the transmission buffer for a later attempt. Several practical ARQ protocols have been proposed to handle transmission failures (see references in Section I). The analysis carried out in the rest of this paper considers the simplified scenario where an infinite sequence of messages is available to all users and, in the case of transmission failure, the current message is discarded and the next message is encoded and transmitted in exactly the same way. The time-hopping sequence for slot selection is not modified by transmission failures (e.g., there is no idle state, waiting for better channel conditions). It is important to notice that each user runs its own ARQ protocol independently of the other users. The only way in which users influence each others is through mutual interference (collisions) that occurs when several users transmit their bursts over the same slot.</p><p>The single-user decoder for user has perfect knowledge of the channel gain and of the SINR <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> for all such that , where denotes the channel power gain. Estimation of the channel gain and of the SINR can be achieved in practice by inserting training symbols into each signal burst, as is currently done in most CDMA and time division multiple access (TDMA) cellular standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>The Hybrid-ARQ protocol described above is a general incremental redundancy scheme (denoted by "INR" for brevity). We consider also the following particular cases.</p><p>1) Generalized Slotted Aloha: The slotted Aloha protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (denoted by "ALO" for brevity) is obtained by assuming for each user a suboptimal decoder that considers only the last received signal block. In classical Aloha it is assumed that a decoding failure occurs (and is detected) whenever a collision occurs. In mobile systems, users might be received at very different power levels because of fading, shadowing, and different distances from the receiver. In this case, a packed can be decoded successfully even if a collision occurs (capture effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Here, we consider a generalized ALO where channel coding is used and messages may be decoded correctly even in the presence of collisions, depending on the SINR.</p><p>2) Repetition Time Diversity: A simple time-diversity scheme (denoted by "RTD" for brevity) is obtained by repeating the same burst of symbols <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This is equivalent to constructing the user code as a concatenated code, where is the outer code and a simple repetition code of length is the inner code. After the th transmission, the receiver performs maximal-ratio combining (MRC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> of the signals and decodes the outer code based on the combined signal Because of the analogy with a rake receiver that performs MRC of the different multipath components of the received signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, this scheme is sometimes referred to as "repetition rake" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CODING, DECODING, AND ERROR DETECTION</head><p>We assume that all codebooks are generated randomly and independently, with i.i.d. components, according to a given probability density function (pdf) over with mean zero and variance . For each user, an encoding function is defined and revealed to the receiver. A key point of the ARQ schemes described in Section II is that decoding errors should be detected. Any complete decoding function, based on a partition of the channel output space into regions (e.g., maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding or maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding), is not suited to this purpose, unless an explicit error-detection stage after channel decoding is introduced (e.g., in many cellular systems a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code is inserted into the information message <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>). This, however, is undesirable since it decreases the throughput by adding extra redundancy. An alternative is the use of possibly suboptimal decoders in terms of error probability, but featuring a built-in error detection capability. Moreover, it is desirable to decode all punctured codes , for , by the same decoder. In particular, we examine the following error correction/detection scheme. Consider decoding for user after received blocks, and let be the transmitted codeword corresponding to information message . The decoder adds to the received signal other dummy signal blocks , generated independently of the received signal, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> to form the observation and then decodes the "mother code" according to the typical set rule (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> and Appendix A for details) defined as follows.</p><p>Let be the event that is the unique codeword jointly typical with . Then • if, for some , the event occurs; • in any other case.</p><p>Since decoder treats all other user signals as additive noise, it "sees" a virtual additive noise channel given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where is the interference plus noise vector. We let denote the single-letter transition pdf of the above channel, conditioned on the channel gains and on the set of active users , and we define to be the mutual information (per letter) of channel (3), expressed as a functional of the pdf's and . Obviously, varies randomly from slot to slot, since it depends on the random set and on the random channel gains . We examine the behavior of codes with decoder defined above, for a given sequence of channel transition pdf's . The average error probability is defined by error (4)</p><p>A decoding error when message is transmitted is not detected if, for some , the event occurs. Then, the average probability of undetected error is defined by undetected error</p><p>(5)</p><p>The following results, proved in Appendix A, show that the typical set decoder defined above is asymptotically optimal for both error and undetected error probabilities, for large burst length :</p><p>Lemma 1 (Achievability): For all there exist and codes of size with error for all and channel sequences such that Lemma 2 (Converse): For all channel sequences such that error for any code of size as .</p><p>Lemma 3 (Error Detection): For all and channel sequences there exists such that any code of size satisfies undetected error .</p><p>The optimal input distribution of the interference channel (3) is not known in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. For the sake of mathematical tractability, we consider (somewhat arbitrarily) circularly symmetric complex Gaussian inputs for all users. Then, the mutual information takes the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> From the above results we have that, by using Gaussian codes and typical set decoding at each step of the ARQ protocols of Section II, the probability of decoding error is arbitrarily small if , very large if , and decoding errors are detected with arbitrarily large probability, for sufficiently large . Practical future system for mobile data transmission will be characterized by a very large value of the product , in order to support large instantaneous bit rates. This motivates a system analysis under the assumption of very large . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> In this regime, we shall assume that, for all and error error and undetected error</p><p>Remark: Bounded Distance and Iterative Decoding: Obviously, the typical set decoder considered above is not suited for practical implementations. However, it is interesting to notice that some non-ML practical decoding schemes show a behavior similar to the typical-set decoder. For example, bounded-distance decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> outputs the message if the received signal falls inside a sphere centered on the codeword corresponding to , while if the received signal is not in any sphere, an error message is declared. Another example is provided by the iterative decoding scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> used to decode turbo codes. The component codes of the turbo code are individually decoded by symbol-by-symbol soft-in soft-out decoders sharing and updating some common information about the reliability of the symbol-wise decisions. Typically, if the codeword is correctly decoded, all component decoders agree on the symbol-wise decisions, while in the presence of decoding errors the decoders keep on reversing the symbol decisions at each iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This ill behavior, as well as the low reliability for some symbols, can be used as error indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Remark: Analogy with the Block-Fading Channel: Under the assumption of Gaussian user code made here, the channel model ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is totally analogous to the block-fading additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with perfect channel state information at the receiver introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, decoding is always performed after blocks and the probability of decoding failure for large is given by , and is referred to as information outage probability. Outage probability finds a very natural interpretation as the limiting error probability for large block length averaged over the random coding ensemble and over the fading states <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. A question left open in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and in many subsequent works is whether there exists a code sequence (for increasing values of the block length ) with error probability arbitrarily small for all fading states such that . Notice that this is not a trivial question, since if the choice of the code sequence depends on the particular fading state, outage probability would not be achievable (it would require side information at the transmitter). The existence of codes asymptotically good for all fading states satisfying is given by Lemma 1 (see the details of the proof in Appendix A). In this respect, information outage probability is not just an average probability of error over a code ensemble, but it can be approached by a given (deterministic) sequence of codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ALO and RTD Schemes:</head><p>In analogy to what was done above for the INR scheme, we can define random coding and typical-set decoding for ALO and RTD. For the sake of brevity, we state without details that, as , also for these schemes there exist codes for which error and undetected error vanish and error goes to , provided that the correct expression for the mutual information is used. ALO takes into account only the most recent received signal burst, therefore, the corresponding is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> In RTD, the SINR after MRC of received bursts is given by the sum <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, therefore, the corresponding is given by ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)</p><p>IV. THROUGHPUT ANALYSIS In this section, we compute the throughput of the ARQ protocols of Section II with the coding and decoding scheme of Section III, in the limit for large . Our analysis is valid under the following idealized assumptions.</p><p>1) An infinite number of information messages is available for each user. As soon as a user stops the transmission of the current codeword, it encodes the next packet and starts its transmission in the next selected slot. As explained in Section II, transmission of a codeword can stop either because successful decoding occurs, or because the delay or rate constraints and are violated (decoding failure).</p><p>2) The ACK/NACK feedback channel is delay-free and error-free. 3) Users select slots for transmission so that the number of slots between two consecutive transmissions of the same user is i.i.d., geometrically distributed with identical parameter for all users. In other words, on each slot each user transmits a signal burst with probability and does not transmit with probability . The expected number of users transmitting over a slot is (average channel load). 4) The channel power gains are i.i.d. random variables (RVs), for all users and slots. 5) All users have the same transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (i.e., ).</p><p>Let count the number of slots, the number of information bits from user successfully decoded up to slot , and the corresponding number of bits per second per hertz. The overall throughput measured in bits per second per hertz is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where the second line follows from the symmetry of the system with respect to any user.</p><p>Consider user 1 transmission. Under the above assumptions, the event that user 1 stops transmitting the current codeword is recognized to be a recurrent event <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. A random reward is associated to the occurrence of the recurrent event. In particular, b/s/Hz if transmission stops because successful decoding, and b/s/Hz if transmission stops because delay/rate constraint violation. We can apply the renewal-reward theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and get with probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where is the random time between two consecutive occurrences of the recurrent event (inter-renewal time). Thus, the desired throughput general expression is <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> In order to evaluate , the mean reward, and , the mean inter-renewal time, we focus on the transmission of a given codeword of user 1 and we define the auxiliary RV to be the number of transmitted bursts between the instant when the codeword is generated and the instant when its transmission is stopped (i.e., between two consecutive occurrences of the recurrent event). We define the event , and the probability that the random sequence of mutual information at the user 1 decoder crosses level at the th step (and not before), or, in other words, the probability of having successful decoding with transmitted bursts. This is given by ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) where <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> The joint probability distribution of and is obtained explicitly as follows (in the case , otherwise, the rate constraint is meaningless): , elsewhere</p><p>(we use the shorthand notation for ).

At this point, we are ready to compute and . A reward is obtained for if successful decoding occurs in slots with transmitted bursts. This corresponds to placing transmissions in the first slots without success, and the th transmission in the th slot with success, which occurs with probability . Therefore,</p><p>The average inter-renewal time is simply given by ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>)</p><p>Finally, the desired closed-form expression for the system throughput is given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">17</ref>) as shown at the bottom of the page (we write in order to stress the dependence on and ).

In fact, in this case, a large number of users transmit with very small probability, and the probability that a user transmits more than once in any finite time is negligible. Therefore, either the packet is successfully decoded at the first attempt, or it is discarded, like in ALO.

The quantity is the capacity of the memoryless -block interference channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, where the interference signal is circularly symmetric complex Gaussian with i.i.d. components and where is the SINR for block .

From a practical system design point of view, in the absence of rate and delay constraints it is convenient to work with a very high burst spectral efficiency , irrespectively of the channel load and the SNR .</p><p>The maximum throughput is achieved for infinite delay. It is interesting to notice that, with infinite delay, the same maximum throughput (with zero packet loss probability) can be achieved by a system without feedback (just forward error correcting codes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. It is natural to ask why the ACK/NACK feedback channel should be implemented at all. The answer is provided by closer examination of the average delay: the system without feedback needs a very large (infinite) delay in order to transmit with arbitrarily small packet loss probability for all values of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. On the contrary, the INR protocol achieves zero transmission failure probability with finite average delay for all strictly less than .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Limits for Large</head><p>We consider an optimized system with respect to and we let . In Appendix C, we show that INR RTD ALO <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> where , and is the cdf of . For AWGN, is a step function with jump in , therefore, . For Rayleigh fading, , therefore, and This shows that for large channel load all schemes are equivalent in AWGN, while ALO performs worse than INR and RTD in Rayleigh fading. In fact, ALO considers only the most recent received block for decoding. Hence, there is no "averaging effect" with respect to the fading affecting the useful signal over a long sequence of slots. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows versus for ALO, 10 dB on AWGN and Rayleigh-fading channel.</p><p>In order to gain insight in the behavior of the ALO protocol, it is useful to take a closer look at the throughput curve in the case of AWGN. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> This curve is obtained by noticing that the supremum of given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> for fixed and is always obtained when for some integer , where is the maximum number of users that can collide on the same slots without causing a decoding error. Therefore, maximizing with respect to (for given ) is equivalent to searching for the maximum of the expression over the nonnegative integers . In particular, for small the maximum is obtained by . In this case, the throughput is maximized by choosing the largest possible , i.e., , and by letting the protocol alone to take care of collisions, like in conventional Aloha. As increases, the maximum is obtained by larger and larger . In this case, the throughput is maximized by choosing in order to tolerate up to interferers, i.e., (a decoding error occurs only when there are more than interferers). In this way, the task of coping with collisions is shared by channel coding and by the retransmission protocol: channel coding yields no errors for up to active users in the slot, while if the number of active users is larger than retransmission is needed.</p><p>As becomes large, a very large number of users transmit in every slot. In the limit, the system is equivalent to a CDMA system with an infinite number of users and infinite spreading gain , such that the ratio is equal to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. In fact, the channel load is precisely the (average) number of users per dimension (per chip).

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows versus for INR and CDMA, 10 dB for AWGN, and Rayleigh-fading channel. Both the multiaccess schemes have the same limiting throughput, equal to , for , however, the INR scheme tends to this limit from above while CDMA from below. Also, notice that for large , the fading increases the throughput of the INR scheme, while it decreases the throughput of CDMA. This can be interpreted in terms of the capture effect. With the bursty discontinuous transmission of slotted INR, only a finite number of users are going to collide on every slot, for every finite . Because of fading, some of the interferers are received with low power and, apparently, this provides a throughput increase for large . On the contrary, in CDMA all users transmit all the time and interfer-ence converges quickly to a deterministic average. Because of the concavity of the logarithm, this provides a throughput decrease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Limits for Large</head><p>In Appendix C we show that <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> for all protocols examined, as opposed to CDMA, for which the limit of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> for large yields for AWGN and in Rayleigh fading . This means that the ARQ system is not interference limited, even if no joint decoding is implemented at the receiver: arbitrarily high throughput can be obtained by simply increasing transmit SNR of all users, irrespectively of power control, fading, etc. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that there is a nonzero probability that only one user is active on any given slot, and can transmit at very high instantaneous rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>Combined channel coding and retransmission protocols appear to be a viable and simple solution for reliable packet-radio communication requiring high instantaneous rates and very low error probability and characterized by bursty sporadic transmission and by mild delay contraints.</p><p>In this paper, we present an information-theoretic throughput analysis of some Hybrid-ARQ protocols under idealized but fairly general conditions. We showed that typical set decoding has very desirable properties for Hybrid-ARQ, in the limit for large slot dimension. From a renewal-reward theory approach, we obtained closed-form throughput formulas for three simple protocols: a generalization of slotted Aloha (ALO), a repetition time diversity scheme with maximal-ratio packet combining (RTD), and an incremental redundancy scheme based on progressively punctured codes (INR). We analyzed the effect of delay and rate constraints on the throughput, as well as the limiting behavior with respect to the slot spectral efficiency, the channel load, and the transmit SNR. Interestingly, all three protocols are not interference limited, and achieve arbitrarily large throughput by simply increasing the transmit power of all users.</p><p>We conclude by pointing out some future research directions inspired by this analysis.</p><p>• Practical coding and decoding schemes based on incremental redundancy and featuring built-in error detection capability should be used with Hybrid-ARQ. Turbo codes (or other forms of concatenated coding) with iterative decoding appear to be a promising solution. However, the behavior of iterative decoders in the presence of decoding errors should be better characterized in order to exploit it for error detection. • The assumption that the receiver knows exactly the timehopping sequences of all users might not be realistic. If user activity is random and not known to the receiver, our results can be seen as an upper bound on the achievable throughput obtained by a genie-aided receiver which knows a priori the active users in each slot. True random access, where the receiver must also detect which users are active in order to make the appropriate packet combining, might be studied by inserting in our framework an active user detection scheme. • In this work, we concentrated on a very simple receiver that does not attempt to decode the users jointly. A natural direction for future research is to consider joint decoding at the receiver (e.g., implemented by stripping). A theoretical difficulty is represented by the user random activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In fact, because of random access, the capacity region varies from slot to slot and it is not known in advance, unless a complicated reservation/allocation scheme is implemented. Also, the set of interfering users might be different from slot to slot, and it is not clear how to carry out joint decoding across the slots. First steps in this direction are taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. • In most practical applications, packet-radio networks must coexist with other systems, as for example, a connectionoriented CDMA system where a large number of lowpower low-rate users transmit continuously. Quite a lot of work has been dedicated to the problem of power control for bursty transmission, where closed-loop schemes are not effective, in the fear that high-rate high-power bursty users might create too much interference to an underlying CDMA system. An appealing consequence of our study is the following: instead of trying to control bursty users, we can let them transmit at full power. Thanks to the ARQ protocol, the signal from all bursty users can be eventually decoded correctly and subtracted from the received signal, so that the underlying CDMA system "sees" a clean channel, as if the bursty users were not there. In this way, the two quite different systems could be layered one on top of the other. Obviously, in order to make this claim, several rigorous issues must be addressed in the details: perhaps the most important of which is the delay. In fact, CDMA users can be decoded only after the signal from bursty users has been subtracted. Then, the variable decoding delay associated with the ARQ protocol imposes a variable decoding delay also on the CDMA system. If CDMA users have a strict delay constraint (e.g., due to real-time speech transmission, like in cellular telephony), outages due to the occurrence of large decoding delay events must be taken into account.</p><p>APPENDIX A PROOFS OF LEMMAS 1, 2, AND 3 Following standard continuity arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, we consider a quantization of the input and a partition of the output of (3) and we work on the resulting discrete channel. The results for the continuous channel can be obtained by taking the supremum over all input quantizations and output partitions. Fix a sequence of channel transition probabilities . Let , where the heft-hand side is the limiting normalized information density over the slots and where, for a fixed sequence of channels, the right-hand side (RHS) is a constant.
