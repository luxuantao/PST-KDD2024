<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present a new scheme for dynamic adaptation of transmission power and contention window (CW) size to enhance performance of information dissemination in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). The proposed scheme incorporates the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism of 802.11e and uses a joint approach to adapt transmission power at the physical (PHY) layer and quality-of-service (QoS) parameters at the medium access control (MAC) layer. In our scheme, transmission power is adapted based on the estimated local vehicle density to change the transmission range dynamically, while the CW size is adapted according to the instantaneous collision rate to enable service differentiation. In the interest of promoting timely propagation of information, VANET advisories are prioritized according to their urgency and the EDCA mechanism is employed for their dissemination. The performance of the proposed joint adaptation scheme was evaluated using the ns-2 simulator with added EDCA support. Extensive simulations have demonstrated that our scheme features significantly better throughput and lower average end-to-end delay compared with a similar scheme with static parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>W E are witnessing an unmistakable convergence of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) that is poised to bring about a revolutionary leap by making our roadways and streets safer and the driving experience more enjoyable <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Working in tandem with the fielded ITS infrastructure, VANET is expected to enhance the awareness of the traveling public by aggregating, propagating, and disseminating up-to-theminute information about existing or impending trafficrelated events. In support of their mission, VANET communications, employing a combination of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) wireless communication are expected to integrate the driving experience into a ubiquitous and pervasive network that will enable novel traffic monitoring and incident detection paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It is worth noting that the vast majority of the traffic advisories are of a general interest and, therefore, benefit from being broadcast. For instance, when a traffic incident occurs, all the vehicles on the road benefit from timely and accurate information dissemination allowing the drivers to make informed decisions. Thus, reliability and low delay are extremely important factors in VANET safety applications. It is widely known that, due to high-speed mobility, V2V and V2I communication links tend to be shortlived. Thus, it is important to propagate traffic-related information toward a certain region of interest instead of sending to a particular vehicle; moreover, one of the best ways of propagating trafficrelated advisories toward a particular region is some form of (controlled) broadcast transmission.</p><p>One strategy of increasing duration of communication links in VANET is by increasing the transmission range in sparse traffic conditions, where only a few vehicles may be present on the road. However, increasing the transmission range may generate high levels of disruptive interference and high-network overhead in dense traffic conditions. It follows that dynamic adaptation of transmission power in response to changing traffic density is a critical requirement in VANET. In addition, in order to propagate emergency messages in a timely manner, VANET must support some form of message differentiation, similar in spirit to service differentiation for QoS in the contention-based channel access mechanism EDCA of 802.11e <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To implement this strategy, different priority levels can be assigned to various traffic-related messages according to their urgency or delay requirements. For example, messages related to an incident on the roadway should be propagated to the target region on time and in an accurate manner in order to avoid congestion and potential secondary accidents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>Because of the advantages it offers, the IEEE 802.11 wireless standard is used by a host of protocols for information forwarding and dissemination in VANET. In 2004, the IEEE Task Group p (TGp) started to develop IEEE 802.11p <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> by amending the IEEE 802.11 standard to include vehicular communication operating at speeds up to 200 km/h and with a communication range as large as 1,000 m. The IEEE 802.11p standard was designed to operate at 5.9 GHz and data rates up to 27 Mb/s with the stated goal of supporting V2I communication or V2V communication in the context of the FCC-mandated Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>To set the stage for the proposed scheme, it is appropriate to note that the use of the EDCA mechanism of 802.11e in the context of VANET was discussed by Suthaputchakun and Ganz <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, where a priority-based scheme for V2V communications was proposed. However, while the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed incorporating of the EDCA mechanism of 802.11e in VANET, they did not address the problem of adapting QoS parameters or that of adapting transmission power according to local traffic conditions.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge the problem of adapting transmission power in VANET based on vehicle density was first discussed by Artimy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, while the problem of dynamically adapting the CW size for reliable broadcast in VANET was discussed by Balon and Guo <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> only considered the channel access time according to the urgency of messages and their delay requirements, without considering the adaptation of transmission power, or the prioritization of messages according to their urgency, or the adaptation of the CW size for transmission opportunity, which can enhance system throughput while reducing end-to-end message delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Our Contribution</head><p>Our work was motivated by the observation that the existing schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> did not take into account the dynamically changing topology of VANET and, consequently, kept either the transmission power of a vehicle or the QoS related parameters fixed. Indeed, the major contribution of this work is a new scheme for joint adaptation of transmission power at the PHY layer and of the CW size at the MAC layer, according to local vehicle density and network condition, respectively.</p><p>The proposed scheme adapts transmission power dynamically based on estimated local traffic/vehicle density. For estimating local vehicle density, we use a different approach than the one proposed by Artimy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; as it turns out, our traffic density approximation is more accurate than the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, resulting in a more appropriate transmission range. In addition, we prioritize messages according to their urgency by incorporating IEEE 802.11e EDCA for timely propagation of high-priority messages toward the destination region.</p><p>We assume that the vehicles start running the proposed scheme as soon as they receive traffic-related messages and note that issues related to incident detection, admission control, as well as security and privacy of transmitted messages and participating vehicles, which are important for ITS, are outside of the scope of this paper.</p><p>The remainder of this work is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the EDCA mechanism of 802.11e and its role in VANET, and we formally state our problem. In Section 3, we present the proposed scheme for joint dynamic adaptation of transmission power and CW values based on vehicle density estimation and network condition. In Section 4, we formally state the algorithm for joint power and CW adaptation followed by presentation of numerical results obtained from simulations in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 offers concluding remarks and directions for future investigations. It is widely known that the baseline IEEE 802.11 standard does not provide for the service differentiation necessary for supporting QoS for time critical data such as voice traffic in WLAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In order to address the issue of service differentiation the IEEE 802.11e standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> specifies the distributed contention-based channel access mechanism, referred to as EDCA. The EDCA is available in the ad hoc mode, where no infrastructure is available. The EDCA scheme relies on CSMA/CA along with a slotted Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) mechanism for contention-based channel access <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and supports MAC-level QoS and prioritization of different data/traffic by defining multiple Access Categories (ACs) with different CW and Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS) values.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> a station with QoS implements four access categories and there is a set of EDCA parameters associated with each AC. These parameters include AIFS [AC] and CW with its minimum and maximum value CWmin [AC] and CWmax [AC], respectively. Each AC from every station independently starts a backoff timer after detecting that the channel is idle for an AIFS [AC] interval and competes with other ACs for channel access and the opportunity to transmit. For each AC, the backoff period is selected from a uniform distribution over [0, CW <ref type="bibr">[AC]</ref>]. The CW size is initially assigned CWmin and doubles when transmission fails, up to CWmax. The CW size is reinitialized when the CW reached CWmax, and the process is repeated. We note that the smaller CWmin [AC], the shorter the channel access delay for the corresponding priority, and hence the better the chance of the station to access the channel in a given traffic condition. When an application is admitted, it has a number of QoS parameters. If two or more backoff timers within the same station finish backoff at the same time, there will be a virtual collision which will be solved by the station's internal scheduler.</p><p>We note that MAC protocols for VANET have to consider different types of traffic messages as well as a rapidly changing network topology. For example, it is highly desirable for emergency messages related to traffic incidents on the roadway to have higher priority than other messages in order to get rapid channel access, and thus prioritization of different messages according to their urgency is an important requirement in VANET. As a consequence, incorporating EDCA in VANET enables better message differentiation and ensures that the high-priority messages get transmission opportunities on a preferential basis.</p><p>Furthermore, in congested traffic the network topology is very dense, while, as soon as the congested region is passed the network topology may become sparse again. In the context of broadcast transmission used for V2V communication, high-transmission power in a region with highvehicle density results in high-network load. Therefore, vehicle density in a given region is a useful metric for adapting the transmission power.</p><p>We present a new method which combines the advantage of dynamic adaptation of transmission power at the PHY layer as a function of vehicle density with dynamic adaptation of CW size in EDCA at the MAC layer to enhance the performance of V2V communications in VANET. The proposed approach ensures that propagation and dissemination of prioritized messages will occur with high throughput and low end-to-end delay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TRANSMISSION POWER ADAPTATION AND PRIORITIZATION OF MESSAGES</head><p>In this section, we describe how transmission range and transmission power are calculated based on local density of vehicles and network conditions, and how different messages are assigned different priorities based on their urgency. One of the starting points of our investigation was provided by the following expression derived in Artimy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for the transmission range (TR) based on the estimated local vehicle density</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T R ¼ min Lð1 À KÞ; ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi L ln L K r þ L ;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where . is a constant from traffic flow theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>,</p><p>. L is the length of the road segment over which the vehicle estimates its initial local vehicle density, and</p><p>. K is the local vehicle density for a given vehicle, calculated as the ratio K ¼ AN T N of the actual number (AN) of vehicles on the road that are present within its transmission range to the total number (T N) of vehicles that can be present on the road for current transmission range, travel speed and safety separation distance as shown schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We note that the method used for estimating K in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> is based solely on the vehicle's movement and may not always give a good estimate of the local traffic density K. For instance, when a given vehicle moves at low speed the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> will estimate that the local vehicle density K is high, while when it moves at high speed it will estimate a low vehicle density K. In order to improve the accuracy of the local vehicle density estimate K, we employ a different method which uses information obtained from the interaction of a given vehicle with other vehicles in the network. For this purpose, we note that in the DSRC standard a given vehicle exchanges its status with neighboring vehicles approximately 10 times each second <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and individual vehicles can use this information to estimate the actual number of vehicles AN in their vicinity by using the 12-bit sequence number of the IEEE 802.11 MAC header. We note also note that this method does not introduce significant network overhead since it exploits the periodic message in DSRC enabled systems, and that a similar approach has been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in a different context where it was used to measure the collision.</p><p>For example, consider that the current TR for a given vehicle is 600 m that is obtained from (1) with L ¼ 1;000 m and the vehicles on the same lane maintain average safety separation distance of 20 m. For a separated highway with two lanes of traffic in each direction, the T N for the given vehicle is calculated as T N % ½600=20 Ã 2 Ã 2 ¼ 120, while the AN for the given vehicle is calculated based on the received information from its neighboring vehicles. Assuming, for example, that AN ¼ 65 we calculate the estimated vehicle density K ¼ AN=T N % 0:54. Using this value of K the given vehicle will update its transmission range using (1). The transmission range TR obtained by using the outlined method for estimating K was compared to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the results, plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> show that our method provides a better estimates of the local vehicle density and, consequently, of the normalized transmission range T R L , which turns out to be closer to the theoretical value obtained when the actual vehicle density K is used in (1) instead of its estimates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Transmission Power Adaptation</head><p>Once the transmission range is obtained using (1), we need to map it to an actual transmission power value. For this purpose, we use the lookup table captured in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> containing the transmit power values corresponding to different transmission ranges. We note that the data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> was obtained by simulations of basic wireless propagation models for different VANET scenarios and a specific power value is assigned for a given transmission range interval to include urban, city, and rural environments. We also note that the lookup table approach is faster since no computations are required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Prioritization of Messages</head><p>As discussed in Section 2, the IEEE 802.11e EDCA has the service differentiation to provide QoS for different types of messages: voice traffic, video traffic, best effort traffic, and background traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To incorporate the EDCA mechanism in VANET, we categorize the different messages according to their urgency and delay requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> as listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>The different access categories in EDCA will have different QoS parameters associated with them. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> gives the QoS parameters corresponding to the ACs in 802.11e EDCA. The higher the access category number, the higher the channel access or transmission opportunity will be. That means the CWmin value for AC(3) will be the least among all ACs. The backoff counter drawn uniformly from [0, CW [AC]] will have an initial value of CWmin, implying that AC(3) will get the highest transmission opportunity over others. Moreover, high priority classes in turn use a shorter interframe spacing (IFS) and a smaller CW size, so that they will get preferential treatment over lower priority classes. Each vehicle will have four different queues, one for each priority class with a virtual collision handler to handle internal collisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Contention Window Size Adaptation</head><p>In order to support message differentiation for different types of messages listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> the size of the CW in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> should also be adapted taking into account the fact that vehicles that have higher priority messages should not get the chance to be greedy (i.e., get channel access most of the time) while higher priority messages should not be waiting for a long time for the opportunity to transmit.</p><p>We note that a vehicle attempting to get transmission opportunity must wait for the channel to remain idle for the duration of the AIFS before starting its backoff timer. We also note that holding channel access for a long time for higher priority messages may result in a delay in message propagation which will not be able to notify and/or prevent incidents on the roadway, such as congestion and trafficjam buildups.  Therefore, to mitigate these adverse effects the dynamic adaptation of QoS parameters, in particular CW sizes, for different access categories is essential since the backoff counter value is obtained uniformly from [0, CW [AC]] and the initial CW value is CWmin. In our proposed approach, the size of the CW may either increase or decrease, and CW adaptation is carried out by applying the well-known approach used in the IEEE 802.11 algorithms by which the size of window CW [AC] is varied by a factor of two. In other words, the window size is doubled if one has to increase the size, and is reduced by half if one has to decrease its size. The CW size will continue to increase until it reaches to maximum size of the window, CWmax <ref type="bibr">[AC]</ref> after which it will be reinitialized to CWmin. Thus, in our proposed approach the window size fluctuates according to the network conditions observed by a vehicle while in conventional 802.11 technologies (including EDCA) the size of the window remains fixed no matter what the network condition is. We note that the increase in CW [AC] values (for all ACs maintaining the hierarchy of CW [AC] values as in EDCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) when the network is congested, will give less opportunity for all ACs to reduce network load because of broadcast and rebroadcast. Similarly the decrease in CW [AC] values (for all ACs maintaining hierarchy of CW values) when the network has less or no collision, will give higher opportunity for all ACs. In both cases, the preferential treatment is preserved by hierarchical increments in corresponding CW [AC] values.</p><p>The local state of the network can be determined as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> by using the record of sequence numbers corresponding to individual vehicles from which it receives messages. By using lost sequence numbers each vehicle can calculate the approximate percentage of lost frames sent by other vehicles to in a given period of time. Using these statistics and based on the local reception rate, each vehicle determines the local state of the network as suggested by Balon and Guo <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and can use it to adapt the CW parameters in the EDCA mechanism. The adaptation of CW size according to network conditions results in high throughput and lower delay for high-priority messages, while lower priority messages also get channel access but with lower preference over higher priority ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The throughput obtained by the proposed scheme using dynamic adaptation of CW values based on network condition was compared to the one reported by Chen et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and the results, plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, 2 show that our scheme outperforms the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">THE ALGORITHM</head><p>Based on the methods discussed in the previous section, we present an algorithm which adapts both transmitted power and CW size and which should be run by individual vehicles periodically to ensure that proper updates of transmission power and CW [AC] values occur according to the local vehicle density and the network condition, respectively. The algorithm is formally stated as Algorithm 1 and consists of two stages: transmit power adaptation and CW size adaptation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dynamic Adaptation of Transmission Power</head><p>Initially, individual vehicles start with an arbitrary transmission power and listen for information from other vehicles. Once a vehicle receives message packets from other vehicles, it starts to analyze the sequence numbers and to count the vehicles around its locale. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of high-transmission power and to increase the duration of the communication link in case of low traffic density for intervehicle communication, each vehicle dynamically adapts its transmission power based on the estimated local vehicle density. The vehicle density within its transmission range is calculated using the method discussed in Section 3.1 which is based on observation of packets that are currently received and does not introduce significant network overhead to identify the neighbors of the vehicle <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Using the estimated vehicle density the algorithm calculates the transmission range using (1), and then sets up the corresponding transmission power using the look up Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>We note that maximum transmit power corresponding to maximum transmission range is selected when either the local vehicle density K is sparse, that is, lower than some application-dependent threshold value 1 or when the vehicle needs to transmit priority 1 messages. 3 The choice of threshold value 1 plays a significant role in the implementation of the algorithm and is also adapted according to the local density observed by a given vehicle periodically based on the threshold history for the given vehicle. Moreover, since the algorithm is employed in a distributed manner threshold values for different vehicles might be different.  <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Throughput versus simulation time for proposed scheme (i.e., by keeping transmission power fixed and without running the power adaptation steps of Algorithm 1) and the method used in Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for higher priority messages (AC(2) and AC(3)).</p><p>2. The simulation setup used to obtain Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> is described in the supplementary electronic document file, which can be found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/ 10.1109/TPDS.2011.41.</p><p>3. Priority 1 messages are transmitted in case of accidents or from emergency vehicles as shown Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. They have low delay requirements and should propagate on time in a single hop (if possible) within the maximum transmission range as all vehicles in the destination region seek emergency related messages, so that they respond to the situation according to the message received. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Dynamic Adaptation of CW Size</head><p>Dynamic adaptation of CW size causes changes in the backoff counter so that timely transmission of messages occurs according to the network conditions, U, the perceived collision rate and local vehicle density. The CW size adaptation is performed as discussed in Section 3.3, in response to network conditions estimated by analyzing the received sequence numbers at MAC layer as discussed in Section 3. The estimated collision rate is an indication of how congested the network is and how information flow from a vehicle should be controlled. The dynamic adaptation of the CW size is regulated by a threshold value 2 . We note that, as it was the case with the power adaptation, proper choice of the threshold value 2 in CW adaptation is important and affects the performance of the system, and that the threshold 2 may also be adapted periodically based on the network conditions and on the threshold history for a given vehicle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SIMULATIONS AND NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed joint dynamic adaptation scheme, we have simulated Algorithm 1 and have compared it with the default EDCA scheme which has fixed values for transmission power and QoS parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The simulation setup is described in the supplementary electronic document file, which can be found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http:// doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.41 and its simulation parameters are summarized in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p><p>In order to incorporate the EDCA mechanism in VANET using ns-2, we have mapped the suitable messages with the corresponding service differentiated EDCA access categories as listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, and have assigned the QoS parameters for each AC once the message becomes available at the vehicle.</p><p>We illustrate the performance of the proposed joint dynamic adaptation scheme for transmit power and contention window by comparing it with the default scheme in terms of the overall throughput and end-to-end message delay in a scenario consisting of approximately 50 percent highest priority messages AC (3) and approximately 50 percent other types of messages AC (0)-AC (2) in the network. This corresponds to the third simulation experiment as described in the supplementary electronic document file, which can be found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http:// doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.41. The  throughput variation is plotted Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, and the average end-toend message delay is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, we note that initially (up to approximately 48 s) the throughput value is similar for both schemes since the vehicles might not be able at first to detect their neighbors, in order to estimate vehicle density and adjust their transmission power and CW size values. As soon as Algorithm 1 start adjusting the transmission power and CW size according to vehicle density and network condition, the overall throughput of the proposed scheme is higher than that of the default scheme. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows the average end-to-end delay for 1) all messages, 2) the highest priority-AC(3) only-messages, and 3) the other AC(0)-AC( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) categories (all message types except highest priority). In all cases there is no delay in the beginning stage (up to approximately 48 s) since all messages get transmission opportunity as soon as they are available at the vehicle. Delay at around 50 s is high since vehicles could not able to adapt the power and CW values according to the vehicle density and network condition during the initial stage of the simulation.</p><p>As simulation time increases, the delay decreases since individual vehicles adapt their transmission power and CW values dynamically according to vehicle density and network condition. As can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> the average end-to-end delay is lower for the proposed scheme than for the default scheme in all cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we presented a new scheme for reliable broadcast transmission in vehicular communication with joint dynamic adaptation of transmission power and CW size. The scheme incorporates the EDCA medium access mechanism of IEEE 802.11e in VANET to set priority for different messages according to their urgency, and consists of an algorithm by which individual vehicles dynamically adapt transmission powers according to the estimated local vehicle densities and adjust CW [AC] for all ACs based on data collision rate on the network.</p><p>Performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated with numerical results obtained from simulations which show that better throughput is achieved with lower delay than when the default scheme is used. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
