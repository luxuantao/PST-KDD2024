<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), or monopedal hopper, is an archetypal model for running in numerous animal species. Although locomotion is generally considered a complex task requiring sophisticated control strategies to account for coordination and stability, we show that stable gaits can be found in the SLIP with both linear and "air" springs, controlled by a simple fixed-leg reset policy. We first derive touchdown-to-touchdown Poincaré maps under the common assumption of negligible gravitational effects during the stance phase. We subsequently include and assess these effects and briefly consider coupling to pitching motions. We investigate the domains of attraction of symmetric periodic gaits and bifurcations from the branches of stable gaits in terms of nondimensional parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Introduction. Locomotion, "moving the body's locus," is among the most fundamental of animal behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A large motor science literature addresses gait pattern selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, energy expenditure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, underlying neurophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and coordination in animals and machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In this paper, we explore the stabilizing effect of a very simple control policy on a very simple running model.</p><p>Legged locomotion is generally considered a complex task <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> involving the coordination of many limbs and redundant degrees of freedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Full and Koditschek note that "locomotion results from complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamically coupled interactions between an organism and its environment." They distinguish locomotion models simplified for the purpose of task specification (templates) relevant range of parameter values. Specifically, we show that a liftoff-event-triggered reset of the leg angle during flight to achieve a touchdown angle fixed at the same value for each stance phase (hereafter, fixed-leg reset) suffices for stability. Such selfstabilized SLIP gaits have already appeared in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure 2]</ref>, where periodic SLIP trajectories were compared to experimental data, although their stability properties were not discussed. Our present work also complements a recent paper of Seyfarth et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, in which parameter ranges for stable, symmetric, periodic SLIP gaits are found by numerical simulation and are compared with data from human running. Here we derive analytical results, perform detailed bifurcation and parameter studies (including a second, nonlinear spring model), explain mechanisms responsible for stable gaits, and elucidate limits to fixed-leg reset stability. We relate our results to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> where appropriate and summarize the relationship between that and the present work in section 5. (Since the first version of the present paper appeared, Geyer, Seyfarth, and Blickhan have also carried out analytical studies by linearizing about the midstance compressed state <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We comment further on this in our conclusions.) Specifically, using conservation laws and simple geometric relations, we produce closed form approximations (explicit up to the evaluation of a quadrature integral) for the touchdown-to-touchdown Poincaré map and the "stability eigenvalue" of its fixed point for a simplified version of the model; see <ref type="bibr">(2.20)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(2.24)</ref>, and Figures <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>. These allow us to plot branches of stable and unstable periodic gaits (Figures <ref type="bibr">8 and 13)</ref> and to understand how the domains of attraction of the stable gaits depend upon parameters. Particular spring laws appear only in the quadrature. We believe that such explicit approximations have not previously appeared; moreover, exact Poincaré maps, requiring only numerical evaluation of the leg sweep angle during stance, are implicit in our derivation. An appropriate notion of stability for such piecewise-holonomic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> is that of partial asymptotic stability. Due to energy conservation and rotational invariance (in the case of coincident "hip joint" and mass center), one or three of the eigenvalues of the linearized Poincaré map are necessarily unity, leaving a single stability eigenvalue that may lie within or outside the unit circle. Thus, at best, the orbits are only Liapunov or neutrally stable. We also find that domains of attraction may be small, especially at high speeds.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we set up the general rigid body model and then focus on an integrable case, in which pitching motions decouple and gravity is neglected during the stance phase <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref>. This allows us to derive explicit stride-to-stride (Poincaré) maps and obtain expressions characterizing periodic gaits, their stability, and bifurcations. Apart from illustrations, this is all done for general leg-spring laws. We then give convincing numerical evidence that stable gaits persist under the inclusion of gravity during stance (2.2) and under coupling to pitching motions <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref>. In section 3, we illustrate our results using the classical Hooke's law spring (3.1) and a progressively hardening compressed air spring <ref type="bibr">(3.2)</ref>. In section 4, we reformulate the equations of motion in nondimensional variables and include gravity during stance, thereby clarifying the effects of parameter variations and the resulting range of behaviors exhibited by the model. Finally, section 5 summarizes the work and notes possible extensions.</p><p>Our work has two main goals: to better understand animal locomotion and to stimulate and enable the creation of "bio-inspired" robots. The former is the subject of an extensive survey paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (currently in press for this journal), to which we refer the interested reader. With regard to the second goal, a significant part of robotics research is driven by the desire to exploit the advantages of legs as opposed Downloaded 11/21/14 to 131.155.81.2. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php to wheels and tracks. Nature suggests, and engineers are increasingly concerned to demonstrate, that legged robots can operate over a greater range of environmental and surface conditions, combining dexterity with mobility and efficiency (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>); moreover, runners that use ballistic flight phases do not require continuous support paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Legged machine designs have traditionally relied on cancellation of natural dynamics by the selection of effective limb reference motions or force balance principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>; indeed, a growing number of commercial entertainment-oriented humanoid robots are controlled in this manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, much as the robot arms used in factory assembly lines. A part of the biped control literature relaxes the assumption of a "grounded" foot in favor of point contacts more suited to modeling locomotion on unstructured terrain, so that arbitrary moments can no longer be supported and a true dynamical analysis is required. In the best case, this leaves just one unactuated degree of freedom, in which case walking <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and running <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> gaits may be developed by using the actuators to anchor a specifically tuned single-degree-of-freedom template. This yields an integrable stride map for which closed form gait stability analysis is possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to low power densities of current devices, completely actuated machines seem unlikely to be agile or to bear much payload (beyond substantial battery packs) for the foreseeable future. In contrast, an underactuated hexapedal robot, RHex, whose design was inspired by rapidly running insects (primarily cockroaches) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, has already demonstrated remarkable agility and stability over rough ground. RHex has a simple feedforward control system in which a single motor actuates each three-degree-of-freedom compliant leg, whose circulation tracks a preprogammed pattern, approximating the fixed-leg reset procedure assumed in this paper. Moreover, empirical evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> suggests that RHex's mass center dynamics, restricted to the sagittal plane, is essentially that of a SLIP, and simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> suggest that, even allowing body pitching and rolling, a suitably rich sensor suite can be used to anchor a three-degree-of-freedom SLIP template. The present analysis of the SLIP and modest generalizations of it should therefore be useful in developing nimble legged robots.</p><p>The high cost, volume, and weight of sensors will limit their numbers as much as those of actuators, so "low attention" controllers, requiring little or infrequent sensing, are of considerable interest. A specific example and natural extension of the present work is the design of control algorithms that enlarge the small basin of attraction of the SLIP with fixed-leg reset <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. A controller yielding global attraction was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> by making the leg angle trajectory time-dependent during flight, based on a numerically precomputed leg trajectory and using velocity sensing. This raised the question of how much sensing is required to obtain "large" basins of attraction. A first step in this direction was undertaken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, where an analytical framework based on symmetric factorization of the return map was shown to yield a necessary condition for the stability of fixed points for arbitrary leg angle trajectories. That condition is formulated in terms of the sensor requirements at liftoff and serves to indicate the sensory "cost of control." A preliminary application of this theory to a SLIP model for RHex appeared in a companion paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Control enters the present paper only as the fixed feedforward leg placement strategy used at touchdown to define the hybrid switching condition. (or hopping) biped with at most one foot on the ground at any time. This model incorporates a rigid body of mass m and moment of inertia I, possessing a massless sprung leg attached at a hip joint, H, a distance d from the COM, G. The figure depicts the attitude or pitch angle θ, the angle ψ formed between the line joining foothold O to the COM and the vertical (gravity) axis, and the distance ζ from foothold to the COM. The quantity</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">η = d 2 + ζ 2 + 2dζ cos (ψ + θ) (2.1)</formula><p>measures the (compressed) leg-spring length: the distance between O and the hip pivot H. We take frictionless pin joints at O and H. The body is assumed to remain in the vertical (sagittal) plane, and its state at any point in time is defined by the position of G, (x G , y G ) referred to a Cartesian inertial frame, and the pitch angle θ. During stance we will also use the generalized polar coordinates ζ, ψ, based at the foothold O, and θ. (Note that ψ increases clockwise, while θ increases counterclockwise.) Unlike many earlier studies of the SLIP, we consider a rigid body with distributed mass and allow pitching motions,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> although in the present paper we focus our attention upon the uncoupled case d = 0 and assume θ ≡ 0, thus largely restricting ourselves to the point mass case.</p><p>A full stride divides into a stance phase, with foothold O fixed, the leg under compression, and the body swinging forward (ψ increasing); and a flight phase in which the body describes a ballistic trajectory under the sole influence of gravity. The stance phase ends when the spring unloads; the flight phase then begins, continuing until touchdown, which occurs when the landing leg, uncompressed and set at a predetermined angle β, next contacts the ground. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This defines a hybrid system <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref> in which touchdown and liftoff conditions mark transitions between two dynamical regimes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> the SLIP model was recast in this framework.</p><p>Recalling previous robotics research <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> and looking ahead to control studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, β could be adjusted from stride to stride (necessitating at least intermittent active neural feedback), but here it will be taken as a fixed parameter. The "fixed leg reset angle" policy of stated interest might be implemented with respect either to the body or to the inertial frame. In the first case, touchdown occurs when the hip reaches the height η 0 sin(β -θ), and in the second case when the hip reaches the height η 0 sin β. Liftoff occurs automatically when the spring force drops to zero, requiring no sensing, but in any physical implementation, even a fixed-leg reset policy requires some state information to initiate the swing phase (e.g., a contact sensor in the foot or force sensor in the spring).</p><p>The kinetic energy of the body is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T = 1 2 m( ζ2 + ζ 2 ψ2 ) + 1 2 I θ2 , (2.2)</formula><p>and its potential energy is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V tot = mgζ cos ψ + V (η (ζ, ψ, θ)) , (2.3)</formula><p>where V = V spr denotes the spring potential. Forming the Lagrangian L = T -V and writing ∂V /∂η = V η , we obtain the equations of motion for the stance phase:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ζ = ζ ψ2 -g cos ψ - V η (η) mη (ζ + d cos (ψ + θ)) , ζ ψ = -2 ζ ψ + g sin ψ + d V η (η) mη (sin (ψ + θ)) , θ = dζ V η (η) ηI sin (ψ + θ) . (2.4)</formula><p>The equations of motion during the flight phase are simply the ballistic COM translation and torque-free rotation equations, which may be integrated to yield</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x G (t) = x LO + ẋLO t, y G (t) = y LO + ẏLO t - 1 2 gt 2 , θ(t) = θ LO + θLO t, (2.5)</formula><p>where (x G , y G ) denotes the COM position and θ the pitch angle, and the superscripts LO refer to the system state at liftoff.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The Case d = 0 Neglecting Gravitational Effects in Stance.</head><p>If the leg is attached at the COM (H ≡ G), then d = 0, ζ ≡ η, the stance phase dynamics simplifies to the "classical" SLIP, and the pitching equation decouples:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ζ = ζ ψ2 -g cos ψ - V ζ (ζ) m , ζ ψ = -2 ζ ψ + g sin ψ, θ = 0 ⇒ θ (t) = θ (0) + θ (0) t.

A detailed analysis of the validity of this approximation for different spring potentials was performed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> using Hamiltonian instead of Lagrangian formalism. This simplification was shown to be too crude over a large range of running gaits, and several closed form approximations to the stance phase dynamics were proposed, although existence and stability of periodic solutions that can arise from concatenation of stance and flight phases were not investigated. Despite the limited accuracy of the gravity-free approximation, we adopt it here in order to gain an analytical understanding of periodic gaits. We will subsequently compare these results to numerical simulations of the full stance dynamics with gravity and show that analogous bifurcation structures persist in the physically more accurate model. We note that a recent analysis of Geyer, Seyfarth, Downloaded 11/21/14 to 131.155.81.2. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php and Blickhan <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> retains gravity and uses linearization about midstance (maximum compression) to derive an approximation that is more effective for small angles.</p><p>Neglecting gravity, the first two equations of (2.6) simplify to</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ζ = ζ ψ2 - V ζ (ζ) m , ζ ψ = -2 ζ ψ. (2.7)</formula><p>The second of these equations expresses the conservation of the moment of linear momentum of the COM about the foot: m ψζ<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> = p ψ = const. The first equation is, therefore, integrable:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ζ = p 2 ψ m 2 ζ 3 - V ζ (ζ) m ⇒ m ζ ζ = p 2 ψ mζ 3 ζ -V ζ (ζ) ζ ⇒ H = m ζ2 2 + p 2 ψ 2mζ 2 + V (ζ) = const. (2.8)</formula><p>Indeed, in the absence of dissipative forces, the total energy, which coincides here with the Hamiltonian H = T + V = E, is conserved. The original three degrees of freedom reduce to one due to the conservation of moment of linear momentum p ψ and body angular momentum p θ individually. The phase portrait during stance is then given by the level sets of H in the region ζ ≤ η 0 ; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> illustrates this for a linear spring and also includes comparisons to solutions of the full system (2.6), including gravity. Three cases are shown, with different stiffness/gravity ratios characterized by the nondimensional parameter 2 γ = kη0 mg ∈ <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">100]</ref>. As expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>, the integrable portraits are perturbed by the inclusion of gravity, but orbits retain the same qualitative characteristics. Leg stiffnesses estimated for human running, for example, give γ ∈ (10, 21) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A]</ref>). Errors approach 20% at the lower end of this range at midstance (near ζ = 0 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(c</ref>)) but are smaller at liftoff. Extensive simulation experience confirms that errors decrease with increasing γ (or k) for initial conditions away from the extremes of the physically interesting operating regimes; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> for a careful discussion of such modeling errors; also see section 2.2 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> below. Moreover, for orbits reflection-symmetric about midstance for which ψ(t) is an odd function, such as the periodic gaits to be found below, the net angular impulse delivered during each stance phase is zero so that, while p ψ is not conserved, it does regain its touchdown value at liftoff. This also tends to minimize errors.</p><p>In principle, we can integrate (2.8), first solving for time in terms of ζ and then inverting and solving for ζ(t) and ψ(t). In particular, the quadrature determining the angle swept by the leg may be written as ∆ψ(v n , δ n ) = τ 0 p ψ mζ 2 dt, where v n and δ n denote the COM velocity magnitude and direction relative to horizontal at the nth touchdown instant. Hence the moment of linear momentum for the nth stance phase may be computed as p ψ = mη 0 v n sin(βδ n ). Then, from conservation of energy (2.8), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ζ = 2 m (E -V (ζ)) - p 2 ψ m 2 ζ 2 ⇒ dt = m dζ 2m (E -V (ζ)) - p 2 ψ ζ 2</formula><p>, (2.9) so that the sweep angle may then be expressed as the quadrature</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∆ψ (v n , δ n ) = 2 η0 ζ b η 0 v n sin(β -δ n ) dζ ζ 2 v 2 n -2V (ζ) m - η 2 0 v 2 n sin 2 (β-δn) ζ 2 . (2.10)</formula><p>Here we have set E = 1 2 mv 2 n , corresponding to the initial energy at touchdown, and ζ b ≤ η 0 denotes the midstride (compressed) leg length.</p><p>Computations of ∆ψ in specific cases of a linear spring and an "air spring" with potential V (η) = c 2 ( 1 η -1 η0 ) 2 are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Schwind and Koditschek <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> develop an approximate expression for this quadrature and compare it with both the exact integral and the analogous stance sweep angle including gravitational effects. In the present paper, we illustrate the general model again with a linear Hooke's law spring but adopt a different version of the nonlinear air spring model-specifically, that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref>. While this potential,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">V (η) = c 2 ( 1 η 2 -1 η 2 0</formula><p>), results in an inverse cubic force law of the form -c η 3 that is nonzero at touchdown and liftoff, energy is conserved since the leg lengths are the same (η = η 0 ), and velocities are continuous. The explicit sweep angle expression for this law is given in Appendix A of the original version of this paper (technical appendices are omitted in this version). For the linear spring,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">V (ζ) = k 2 (η -η 0 ) 2 = k 2 (ζ -η 0 ) 2 , and we have ∆ψ = (2 sin(β -δ)/ k)D( k; β -δ),</formula><p>where k = . The quadrature for a different air spring model is also given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The stance phase dynamics described above must be composed with the ballistic dynamics of the flight phase of (2.5), and the overall dynamics and the stability of this piecewise-holonomic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> are best described via Poincaré or return maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>. It is convenient to choose as generalized coordinates to describe the map the magnitude of touchdown and liftoff velocities v between the velocity vectors and the horizontal datum; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>. The full map is obtained by composition of the stance phase map</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">P st : v T D n δ T D n → v LO n δ LO n (2.11)</formula><p>and the flight map</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P fl : v LO n δ LO n → v T D n+1 δ T D n+1</formula><p>(2.12)</p><p>as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P = P fl • P st : v T D n δ T D n → v T D n+1 δ T D n+1 .

Since V (η) is decreasing on the interval (0, η 0 ) for physically reasonable spring laws, the condition λ 2 = -1 can be met.

The unstable fixed point is lost, and the (previously stable) fixed point δ → 0 + , as shown in Figures <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref>. (As we shall see, this "change of type" does not occur for the air spring model, which has the physically desirable property that the spring force increases without bound as it is compressed to zero length.)

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Two Examples.</head><p>In section 2.1.3, we discussed general conditions for stability, saddle-node bifurcations, period-doubling, and the appearance of a gap, and we classified the solutions in terms of ∆ψ max , the maximum leg angle swept during stance, assuming only that the function ∆ψ(v, δ) has a unique maximum but without specifying any particular spring law. In the following section, we consider two specific and commonly used spring models: a linear Hooke's law spring and an air spring that mimics the compressed air strut used in certain hopping robots. Throughout this section, we employ the approximation of section 2.1, ignoring gravity during stance.</p></div>

We note that the domain of attraction of the stable fixed point opens and grows following v = vSN until it is invaded by the gap; thereafter, it shrinks as v increases. Also note that the larger δ n fixed point disappears at a finite speed v ≈ 5.9 due to the change of type of ∆ψ and the stance map when δ → β, and kinetic energy at touchdown exceeds the potential energy stored in the spring at zero length (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and also see Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</p><p>We have also seen gaps in the domain of definition of P 2 for low velocities v &lt; vSN (before the saddle-node), but these are of less concern since there are no sustained gaits in this range.</p><p>As noted in section 2.1.5, period-doubling bifurcations may occur as v increases, depending upon the spring potential and other parameters.

The question then arises whether the gap always opens before period-doubling occurs or whether period-2 and higher period orbits or even chaotic behavior is observed for gap-free return maps.

Seven physical parameters m, I, d, η 0 , β, g, k have been reduced to five: Ĩ, d, β, g, k.

The general shape of the surface of equilibria is preserved, although the influence of g on the saddle-node location kSN lessens as β decreases and kSN itself decreases, corresponding to higher velocities. Also, for fixed β, increases in g cause the lower (stable) branch to shrink until it disappears so that when gravity plays a dominant role (low speed and/or long leg), there is only one unstable fixed point; cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14(c</ref>) with g ≈ 1, and see <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr">Fig. 7]</ref>. It can also happen, as noted in section 3.1 (Figure <ref type="figure">8(a)</ref>), that the upper branch terminates and only one (potentially) stable fixed point exists, e.g., near β = 1.25, k ≈ 1, g ≈ 0.01 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14(c)</ref>.

Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php imation that gravity is negligible during stance. Numerical simulations including gravitational effects corroborated this result, revealing regions in the parameter and phase spaces where stable gaits exist. We considered two representative spring laws: a linear spring and a hardening air spring representative of pneumatically sprung legs used in hopping machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, and we studied bifurcations from the branch of stable gaits, the domains of attraction of those gaits, and the domains of definition of the Poincaré map, picking parameter values appropriate to illustrating key behaviors rather than for comparison with specific animals or machines. Throughout we focused on the classical SLIP, but our formulation includes full rigid body dynamics in the sagittal plane, and we displayed some coupled translation and pitching motions. Future work will include a broader analysis of these aspects.</p><p>As noted in the introduction, our work complements the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which addresses parameter ranges relevant to human running. Using direct numerical solution of the point mass SLIP equations (equivalent to the first two of (2.6)), <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> identifies parameters for which potentially stable period-1 gaits exist and shows that models with masses, leg lengths, and stiffnesses estimated from human data fall within a narrow range [25, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(A)</ref>]. A set of apex height Poincaré maps and some COM trajectories are also shown [25, Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3(A)-(B)</ref>]. It is noted that there is a minimum speed below which periodic gaits do not exist, that "larger variations in leg stiffness and angle of attack are tolerated [for] increasing speed," and that "higher . . .velocities require either higher leg stiffness assuming constant angle of attack, or flatter angles of attack for constant leg stiffness" <ref type="bibr">[25,</ref>  We believe that the present analytical work, with the associated limiting integrable cases, illuminates those observations. Specifically, our bifurcation studies reveal limits to stable parameter ranges bounded by saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations, the former being responsible for <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>'s minimum speed requirement; our nondimensional analysis shows clear speed/stiffness relations (e.g., <ref type="bibr">(4.4)</ref> for the linear spring) and reveals the relative importance of elastic and gravitational effects; and our study of gaps in the domain of definition of P ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>'s apex/touchdown height constraint) shows that, while stable fixed points or higher period orbits continue to high velocity, their domains of attraction become extremely small. This shows that, with increasing speed, the system is less tolerant to dynamical perturbations, even though parameter variations are less restricted, as observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> (see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>). However, the bifurcation diagrams of Figures <ref type="figure">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref> show that, if the nondimensional parameters are maintained in a "good" location (e.g., between the saddle-node and gap of Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>) as v changes, by suitable tuning of stiffness or touchdown angle, then robust stability can be achieved with simple fixed-leg reset control.</p><p>The analytical study of the point mass SLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, published after the original version of the present paper appeared and using a different approximation, is also relevant. In this paper Geyer, Seyfarth, and Blickhan first obtain an integrable system by the equivalent of setting cos ψ ≈ 1 in (2.3) to decouple the rotational degree of freedom ψ so that angular momentum mζ 2 ψ is conserved and the two-degree-offreedom system is integrable by quadratures, as in the present paper. However, while neglecting the effect of gravitational moment on angular momentum, they include a constant component of gravity in the radial direction, effectively setting g cos ψ ≈ g in the first equation of (2.6). They then expand the effective potential to second order in the spring displacement (ζη 0 )/η 0 and approximate the quadrature in terms of elementary trigonometrical functions. They express the resulting dynamics as an Downloaded 11/21/14 to 131.155.81.2.

Using the analytical expression for the approximate Poincaré map, a relation between the dimensionless spring stiffness γ and the touchdown angle β for asymptotically stable gaits is derived which agrees in a certain limit with the empirically found γ-β relation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we note two recent studies of the three-dimensional point mass SLIP. Seipel and Holmes <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref> use the gravity-free stance approximation, which implies that the mass center remains within a plane spanned by the touchdown velocity and leg placement vectors during stance, and allows them to adapt the present analysis. They show that periodic gaits are all unstable to toppling out of the saggital plane, but that orbits can easily be stabilized by feedback adjustments of leg angle based on mass center velocity at touchdown. Carver <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref> describes control policies in which leg stiffness and touchdown angle are set in response to mass center position and velocity during flight, and shows that single-step deadbeat control is possible to stabilize some, but not all, tasks. Seipel and Holmes are currently studying the three-dimensional problem with multiple leg support during stance, and find that passive stability with fixed leg reset is possible with double (kangaroo hopping) and triple (insect tripod) support patterns. We intend to build on these results, using the methods of the present paper, to develop analytically tractable models of RHex and of insects.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 The hopping rigid body (a), and the stance and flight phases comprising a full stride (b).</figDesc></figure>
