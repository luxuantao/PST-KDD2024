<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The classical PCP theorem is arguably the most important achievement of classical complexity theory in the past quarter century. In recent years, researchers in quantum computational complexity have tried to identify approaches and develop tools that address the question: does a quantum version of the PCP theorem hold? The story of this study starts with classical complexity and takes unexpected turns providing fascinating vistas on the foundations of quantum mechanics and multipartite entanglement, topology and the so-called phenomenon of topological order, quantum error correction, information theory, and much more; it raises questions that touch upon some of the most fundamental issues at the heart of our understanding of quantum mechanics. At this point, the jury is still out as to whether or not such a theorem holds. This survey aims to provide a snapshot of the status in this ongoing story, tailored to a general theory-of-CS audience.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Perhaps the most fundamental result in classical complexity theory is the Cook-Levin theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, which states that SAT, the problem of deciding satisfiability of a Boolean formula, is NP-complete. This result opened the door to the study of the rich theory of NP-completeness of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). At the heart of this framework stands the basic understanding that computation is local, made of elementary steps which can be verified one at a time.</p><p>The main object of this study is the k-local constraint satisfaction problem. A k-CSP is a formula on n Boolean (or higher dimensional) variables, composed of m constraints, or clauses, each acting on at most k variables, where k should be thought of as a small constant (say, 2 or 3). By a constraint, we mean some restriction on the assignments to these k variables which forbids one or more of the 2 k possible strings. As a consequence of the Cook-Levin theorem, deciding whether or not a CSP instance has a satisfying assignment is exactly as hard as deciding whether a given polynomial-time Turing machine has an accepting input: it is NP-complete.</p><p>Starting with the development of interactive proofs in the 1980s, a long line of work in complexity theory has resulted in a considerable strengthening of the Cook-Levin theorem, leading to the celebrated PCP (for Probabilistically Checkable Proofs) theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. In its gap amplification version due to Dinur <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the PCP theorem states that it is NP-hard to distinguish between the cases when an instance of CSP is completely satisfiable, or when no more than 99% of the constraints can be satisfied. In other words, not only is it NP-hard to determine exactly the maximum number of satisfiable clauses, but it remains NP-hard to do so up to an approximation that scales as a constant fraction of the total number of clauses. In fact, a major development stemming from the PCP theorem is research on hardness of approximation, where one attempts to determine for which approximation factors a given class of k-CSPs remains NP-hard. A surprising outcome of this line of work has been that for many k-CSPs, the hardness of approximation factor matches that achieved by a random assignment. For instance, a random assignment to a 3-SAT formula already satisfies 7/8 of the clauses in expectation, and it is NP-hard to do even slightly better, namely to distinguish between 7/8 + ε and 1.</p><p>The original version of the PCP theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> was stated quite differently. Owing to its origins in the development of the celebrated IP = PSPACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> and MIP = NEXP <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> results from the theory of interactive proofs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, it can be phrased as follows: any language in NP can be verified (up to constant error) by a polynomial time verifier who only reads a constant (!) number of randomly chosen bits from a polynomial-size proof. Hence the term probabilistically checkable proofs. Though this formulation may a priori sound quite different from the gap amplification one, it is quite easy to see they are equivalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>: roughly, if any assignment must violate a constant fraction of the clauses, then sampling a clause at random and checking whether is it satisfied (which only requires reading the bits of the clause) would detect a violation with constant probability. It is often useful to interchange between the two pictures; we will make use of both here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Quantum Hamiltonian complexity</head><p>Over the past decade, a fascinating analogy has been drawn between the above major thread in classical computational complexity, namely the study of CSPs, and the seemingly unrelated field of condensed matter physics. The object of condensed matter physics is the study of properties of condensed phases of matter, such as solids or liquids, in which typically the systems consist of many interacting particles governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. A central question of study is which configurations of the particles minimize the energy, and what this minimal energy is. The energy of the system is determined by an operator called the Hamiltonian. It typically consists of a sum of local terms, namely terms that determine the energy of only a few particles at a time. 5  The total energy is the sum of contributions coming from each of those local terms. We can think of each local term as a generalized constraint, and its contribution to the energy as a signature of how violated the local constraint is. We see that the question of finding the configuration of lowest energy has a very similar flavor to the central question in CSPs, which is: what is the assignment that violates the smallest possible number of clauses? We will now explain that this connection can be made very precise, and that k-CSPs can be viewed as a special case of local Hamiltonians.</p><p>We first need to describe the state space in quantum many-body physics. 6 The space of pure states of n two-state particles, 7 also called quantum bits, or qubits is a complex vector space of dimension 2 n . It is spanned by an orthonormal basis of 2 n states, which we call the computational basis and denote by |i 1 , ..., i n = |i 1 ⊗ • • • ⊗ |i n , where i j ∈ {0, 1}. The notation |• , called Dirac notation, is simply a way to clarify that we are speaking of a (column) vector, also called ket, in a Hilbert space. The bra notation φ| is used to denote a row vector; φ|ψ denotes the inner (scalar) product, while |ψ φ| denotes the outer product, a rank-1 matrix. The reader unfamiliar with the definition of the tensor product ⊗ may treat it as a simple notation here; it possesses all the usual properties of a product -associativity, distributivity and so on. States, such as the basis states, which can be written as a tensor product of single-qubit states are called product states. States which cannot be written as tensors of single qubit states are called entangled, and they will play a crucial role later on. A general pure state of the n qubits is specified by a vector |ψ = a i a i |i 1 , ..., i n , where a i are complex coefficients satisfying the normalization condition i |a i | 2 = 1. Such a linear combination of basis states is also called a superposition. A k-local Hamiltonian H acting on a system of n qubits is a 2 n × 2 n matrix that can be written as a sum H = m i=1 H i , where each H i is Hermitian and acts non-trivially only on k out of the n particles; we require H i ≤ 1 for all i. Formally, this means that H i can be written as the tensor product of some matrix acting on k qubits and the identity on the rest. For the purposes of this column it is best to think of each H i as a projection; the general case does not introduce any new essential properties. Given a state |ψ , its energy with respect to the Hamiltonian H is defined to be ψ|H|ψ = m i=1 ψ|H i |ψ . How to interpret the value ψ|H i |ψ ? When H i is a projection then H 2 i = H i ; in this case it is exactly the norm squared of the vector H i |ψ . By the laws of quantum mechanics this is exactly the probability of obtaining the outcome '1' when measuring the state with respect to the two-outcome measurement {H i , I -H i }, and we can think of it as the probability that |Ψ violates the i-th constraint. We note that if |ψ is an eigenstate of H, then ψ|H|ψ is simply the eigenvalue associated with |ψ . The eigenvalues of H are called the energies of the system; the lowest possible energy, denoted E 0 , is the smallest eigenvalue of H, and the corresponding eigenvector (or eigenspace) is called the groundstate (or groundspace). Computing the ground energy and understanding the characteristics of the groundstates for a variety of interesting physical systems is arguably the subject of the majority of the theoretical research in condensed matter physics.</p><p>Kitaev introduced a computational point of view on those physical questions by introducing the following problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1.1 (The k-local Hamiltonian (LH) problem)</head><p>• Input: H 1 , ..., H m , a set of m Hermitian matrices each operating on k qubits out of a n-qubit system and satisfying H i ≤ 1. Each matrix entry is specified by poly(n)-many bits. Apart from the H i we are also given two real numbers, a and b (again, with polynomially many bits) such that Γ = ba &gt; 1/poly(n). Γ is referred to as the absolute promise gap of the problem; γ = Γ/m is referred to as the relative promise gap, or just, the promise gap. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">φ = C 1 ∧ C 2 ∧ • • • ∧ C m be a 3-SAT formula on n variables,</formula><p>where each C i is a disjunction over three variables or their negations. For every clause C i , we define an 8 × 8 matrix H i operating on three qubits to be a projection on the unsatisfying assignment of C i . For example, for the clause</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C i = X 1 ∨ X 2 ∨ ¬X 3</formula><p>we get the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H i = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝</formula><p>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ .</formula><p>We then consider the operation of H i on all the qubits, by taking the tensor product of H i with the identity on the remainder of the qubits. We denote the new matrix by H i too, in a slight abuse of notation. If z is an assignment to the n variables which satisfies a clause C i , then H i |z = 0, namely, |z has 0 energy with respect to that clause. Otherwise, H i |z = |z , and so the energy of |z with respect to that clause is 1. Notice that here z|H i |z is either 0 or 1, while for general quantum states |ψ , ψ|H i |ψ is a real number between 0 and 1. Denoting H = m i=1 H i , it is now clear that H|z = q|z where q is the number of clauses unsatisfied by z. Thus, 3-SAT is equivalent to the following problem: "Is the smallest eigenvalue of H 0, or is it at least 1?", which is an instance of the 3-local Hamiltonian problem.</p><p>This construction shows that CSPs can be seen as a very special class of local Hamiltonians: those for which all the local terms are diagonal in the computational basis. In this case, the eigenstates of the system are the computational basis vectors, and as quantum states, they are simple product states which are not entangled. However, the local Hamiltonians that are considered in condensed matter physics are far more general: the local terms need not be diagonal in the computational basis. The lowest eigenstates of such Hamiltonians may contain intricate multipartite entanglement. The presence of this entanglement is at the core of the challenges that the field of quantum Hamiltonian complexity faces, a field that attempts to provide a computational perspective on the study of local Hamiltonians and their groundstates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">The quantum PCP conjecture</head><p>One of the central efforts undertaken by quantum Hamiltonian complexity is to understand how the additional ingredient of multipartite entanglement affects the classical CSP results. The first step in this endeavor has already been completed, to a large extent. In 1999 Kitaev <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref> established the quantum analogue of the Cook-Levin theorem. First, he defined the quantum analogue of NP, called QMA (apparently, this notion was first discussed by Knill <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>), which is defined just like NP except both the witness and verifier are quantum: Definition 1.2 (The QMA complexity class) L ∈ QMA if there exists a quantum polynomial time algorithm V (called the verifier) and a polynomial p(•) such that:</p><p>• ∀x ∈ L there exists a state |ξ on p(|x|) qubits such that V accepts the pair of inputs (x, |ξ ) with probability at least 2/3.</p><p>• ∀x / ∈ L and for all states |ξ on p(|x|) qubits, V accepts (x, |ξ ) with probability at most 1/3.</p><p>Kitaev showed that the LH problem is complete for QMA. The fact that it is inside QMA is quite simple (the witness is expected to be the lowest energy eigenstate); the other direction is more involved and proving it requires overcoming new obstacles unique to the quantum setting. The main ingredient is the circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction, which maps a quantum circuit to a local Hamiltonian whose groundstate corresponds to the correct history of the computation of the circuit (we return to this construction in Subsection 3.1). Many exciting results followed from this construction. To mention a few: the equivalence of quantum computation and adiabatic quantum computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, extensions of QMA-hardness to restricted classes of Hamiltonians <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref> including the counterintuitive discovery that even local Hamiltonians acting on nearest-neighbor particles arranged on a line are QMA-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, even for translationally invariant systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>; the invention of quantum gadgets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref> which resemble classical graphical gadgets often used in classical NP reductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>; and very interestingly, a proof that a famous problem in physics (known as the "universal functional" problem, and related to finding the groundstate of electrons interacting through the Coulomb potential) is QMA hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. However, viewed from a wider perspective, the current situation in quantum Hamiltonian complexity can be compared to the situation in classical computational complexity in the early 1970s: after the foundations of the theory of NP-hardness had been laid down by Cook, Levin <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, but before the fundamental breakthroughs brought in by the study of interactive proofs and the PCP theorem. Does a quantum version of the PCP theorem hold? The question was raised more than a decade ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, then several times later (e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>), and rigorously formulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. It states:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conjecture 1.3 (Quantum PCP by gap amplification)</head><p>The LH problem with a constant promise gap γ &gt; 0 is QMA-hard, under quantum polynomial time reductions.</p><p>More formally, the conjecture states that there exists a quantum polynomial time transformation that takes any local Hamiltonian H = m i=1 H i with absolute promise gap Γ = Ω(1/poly), and, with probability exponentially close to 1, transforms it into a new local Hamiltonian H = m i=1 H i with a promise gap Γ = Ω(m ), such that: If the original system had ground energy at most E (at least E + Γ) then the new system has ground energy of at most E (at least E + Γ ). Just as with the classical PCP theorem, the above conjecture has an equivalent statement in terms of efficient proof verification. Conjecture 1.4 (Quantum PCP by proof verification) For any language in QMA there exists a polynomial time quantum verifier, which acts on the classical input string x and a witness |ξ , a quantum state of poly(|x|) qubits, such that this verifier accesses only O(1) qubits from the witness and decides on acceptance or rejection with constant error probability.</p><p>The proof that the two qPCP conjectures are equivalent is not difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, but we note that to the best of our knowledge, the fact that the reductions in the statement of Conjecture 1.3 are allowed to be quantum is necessary for the equivalence to hold. More precisely, this is needed to show that Conjecture 1.4 implies Conjecture 1.3. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">8</ref> The fact that the simple connection between the two pictures <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> breaks down in the quantum world may already hint at the possible difficulties in proving a qPCP conjecture. In most of this column we shall refer to Conjecture 1.3 as the qPCP conjecture.</p><p>We remark that if the qPCP conjecture holds with k-local Hamiltonians with k &gt; 2, it also holds with 2-local Hamiltonians over qubits, using "quantum gadgets" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> that translate each k-local term to constantly many 2-local ones, while retaining a Γ = Ω(m) absolute promise gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Physical motivations for the conjecture</head><p>In addition to it being a natural and elegant extension of the PCP theorem, interest in the qPCP conjecture is many-fold. First, as we will explain in great detail, the heart of the difficulty of the qPCP conjecture is the presence of exotic forms of multipartite entanglement in the groundstates of local Hamiltonians. It is this entanglement which makes the conjecture a much more challenging extension of the classical PCP theorem than it might seem at first sight. It also provides great motivation for the study of the conjecture, which provides an excellent computational probe into this highly counterintuitive phenomenon and may lead to important new insights. A significant part of this column is devoted to explaining this aspect of the qPCP conjecture.</p><p>A separate motivation for the study of qPCP is its direct relevance to physics, and in particular to the stability of entanglement at so-called "room temperature". The usual intuition is that quantum correlations typically do not persist at finite non-zero temperatures for systems in equilibrium. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">9</ref> The qPCP conjecture, however, implies exactly the opposite! Roughly, the argument goes as follows. A physical system at equilibrium at temperature T &gt; 0 is described by the so-called Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution over eigenstates |E i , with corresponding energy E i , of its Hamiltonian. Up to normalization, this distribution assigns probability e -E i /T to the eigenstate |E i . At the limit T → 0 the system is concentrated on its groundstate, which is the main reason for studying groundstates in the first place.</p><p>But what happens at higher temperatures? Since the probabilities for the energies have a very strong exponential decay in the energy, the total contribution of states with energy at least ∼ nT above the ground energy is exponentially small. Suppose the qPCP holds for some absolute promise gap Γ = Ω(m) = Ω(n), with m being the number of constraints, which we may assume to be larger than n. Then all states below that gap must be highly entangled, for otherwise one of them could be provided as a classical witness for the ground energy of H, putting the problem in NP. By taking T to be a small enough constant we get ∼ nT &lt; Γ, and so for such Hamiltonians the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at constant temperature T &gt; 0 is essentially supported on highly entangled states, contradicting the physical intuition. This suggests that resolving the qPCP conjecture might shed light on the kind of Hamiltonians which possess robust entanglement at room temperature, and what physical properties such Hamiltonians exhibit.</p><p>We mention that the qPCP implies an even stronger claim: not only should the equilibrium state be highly entangled, but for the system to reach its equilibrium at room temperature, even approximately, a QMA-hard problem must be solved. Indeed, a state drawn from the Gibbs distribution at room temperature can serve as a witness to solve a QMA-hard problem, namely estimating the energy of the system's Hamiltonian. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">10</ref> We already know by the classical PCP theorem that for general classical systems to reach their equilibrium at room temperature they must solve an NP-hard problem, as follows from the same Gibbs distribution argument as above; but one can draw an even stronger statement from the qPCP conjecture: that quantum entanglement must play a crucial role in the dynamics of reaching equilibrium even at room temperature, for certain systems, assuming QMA = NP.</p><p>This apparent contradiction between physical intuition and the qPCP conjecture is captured by an elegant conjecture due to Hastings <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, the NLTS (no low-energy trivial states) conjecture. The conjecture isolates the notion of robustness of entanglement from the remaining difficulties related to the qPCP conjecture: it states that Hamiltonians whose low-energy states are all highly entangled do exist. While the NLTS conjecture must be true for the qPCP to hold, the other direction is not known. Much of the recent progress on the qPCP conjecture can be phrased in terms of this conjecture, and we devote a whole section to recent progress on this conjecture, both negative and positive.</p><p>Despite the recent flurry of results attempting to make progress on the qPCP conjecture and related topics (eg., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37]</ref>), there does not seem to be a clear consensus forming as to whether it is true or false. But what is becoming undoubtedly clear is that much like it was the case in the long journey towards the proof of the classical PCP theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>, the study and attempts to resolve the qPCP conjecture bring up beautiful new questions and points of view, and the goal of this survey is to present some of these developments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Outlook</head><p>We proceed with a discussion of multipartite entanglement, including the EPR state, CAT states and a beautiful example of the strong global properties of multiparticle entanglement, Kitaev's toric code <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>. In Sec. 3 we explain how issues raised by multipartite entanglement are resolved in the proof of the quantum Cook-Levin theorem, and what further obstacles are posed when trying to extend classical proofs of the PCP theorem to the quantum domain. Here we also present the recent result of Brandão and Harrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref> which captures formally some of the limitations on proving the qPCP conjecture following the classical route. In Sec. 4 we introduce Hastings' NLTS conjecture regarding robust entanglement at room temperature, explain in more detail its connection to the qPCP conjecture, and describe recent results <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32]</ref> which provide strong limitations on the Hamiltonians which could possibly possess such robust entanglement; we also describe a recent positive attempt <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> based on low-dimensional topology. In our last section, we take a look at the original line of works which led to the proof of the PCP theorem, namely interactive proofs. We present an exponential size classical PCP for QMA (resolving an open question from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>) based on the famous sum-check protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and then discuss how the connection between PCPs and two-player games, which played a crucial role classically, breaks down in the quantum world, leading to many new exciting problems. We conclude with a brisk overview of several points which were not covered in this survey.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Local and global entanglement</head><p>The most famous example of an entangled state is the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state of a pair of qubits:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">|ψ EP R = |00 + |11 √ 2 . (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>It is easy to see that this state cannot be written as a tensor product of two single qubit states.</p><p>There are interesting consequences to this. Suppose we measure the left qubit in the orthonormal basis {|0 , |1 }. We have a probability 1/2 of obtaining 1; the joint state of both qubits then collapses to |11 and the right qubit, if measured, will always result in the outcome 1. Likewise, if the left qubit is found to be 0, the right one is also found to be 0. The results of the measurements of the left and right qubits are fully correlated. This full correlation can of course also happen classically. The important property is that the EPR state exhibits similarly strong correlations in any basis, not only the computational one. These correlations -which baffled Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen themselves -were shown by John Bell <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref> to be stronger than any classical bipartite system could exhibit. Experiments providing evidence of the inherent quantum nature of physical systems have been successfully performed many times, starting with the work of Aspect in the 1980s <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>.</p><p>A system of 2n particles can be in the product of n EPR pairs. Though such a state may seem highly entangled, in a sense its entanglement is not more interesting than that of a single EPR state; in particular, the entanglement is local in the sense that each qubit is correlated to only one other qubit. Multiparticle systems can exhibit far more interesting types of entanglement. Let us consider a different generalization of the EPR pair to n qubits, the so-called n-qubit CAT states</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">|Ψ ± CAT = |0 n ± |1 n √ 2 = |0 ⊗ • • • ⊗ |0 ± |1 ⊗ • • • ⊗ |1 √ 2 . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>We would like to argue that the entanglement in the CAT states is non-local, or global. To explain this, we need to make a small detour and introduce the formalism of density matrices.</p><p>In a product state, any single particle has a well-defined state associated with it as a superposition of |0 and |1 . Suppose, however, the global state is entangled: how do we describe the state of a single particle? In general, the particle (or, more generally, a subset of k particles) will be in a mixed state: a probability distribution over pure states. We have already encountered such distributions in the discussion of the Gibbs distribution in Subsection 1.2. To derive the expression for the mixed state of k particles out of n, imagine virtually measuring the remaining nk qubits of the system in some (arbitrary) basis. This operation, called tracing out, results in a distribution over pure states of the k qubits. We can assign to this distribution a trace 1 positive definite matrix, called the reduced density matrix, as follows:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">11</ref> ρ = α Pr(α)|α α|, where α ranges over all possible pure states of one qubit, and |α α| denotes the orthogonal projection on the one dimensional subspace spanned by |α . Locally, the density matrix provides a complete description of the state of the k particles, in the sense that it contains enough information to determine the distribution of outcomes of any possible measurement applied to the particles. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Let us return to the states |Ψ +</head><p>CAT and |Ψ - CAT . We claim that, locally, they look identical; in other words, the reduced density matrices of those states on any strict subset of qubits are identical. To see this, consider measuring a subset of nk of the qubits in the computational basis. A simple exercise shows that the remaining k qubits are described by a uniform mixture of |0 k 0 k | and |1 k 1 k |, independent of whether we started from the "+" or "-" CAT states. This is a remarkable feature: the two CAT states are orthogonal, but when tracing out even one of the qubits, they look exactly the same; they cannot be distinguished solely from their reduced densities on even all but one qubit. In particular, no local measurement (or even a sequence of those) can distinguish in-between those states. This means that part of the information carried by the pair of states is stored in a global manner, inaccessible to local observations. Multipartite entanglement, however, is far richer than that exhibited by the CAT states. We proceed with the description of the beautiful example of Kitaev's toric code states <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>, which demonstrate some of the most counterintuitive properties of multiparticle entanglement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The toric code</head><p>The toric code is defined as the groundspace of a 4-local Hamiltonian which acts on a set of n qubits placed on the edges of a √ n × √ n two-dimensional grid, made into a torus by identifying boundaries. To define the local terms, we first need to introduce the Pauli matrices Z, X. These are 2 × 2 operators that act on a single qubit. In the computational basis they are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Z = 1 0 0 -1 , X = 0 1 1 0 .</formula><p>Both X and Z are Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues ±1, and they anti-commute: ZX = -ZX.</p><p>The local terms of the Hamiltonian are of two types: plaquette constraints, and star constraints. A plaquette p is a face of the lattice surrounded by 4 edges (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). To each plaquette p we associate a local term A p defined as the product of Pauli Z operators on the qubits that sit on the plaquette's edges. A star s consists of the 4 edges adjacent to a given vertex in the grid (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). To each star s we associate a local term B s which is the product of Pauli X operators acting on the qubits sitting on the edges of the star. Hence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A p := e∈p X e , B s := e∈s Z e ,</formula><p>where X e , Z e denote Pauli matrices acting on the qubit that sits on the edge e. The toric code Hamiltonian is then given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H toric := - p A p - s B s .</formula><p>What does the groundstates of H toric look like? Note first that, although the X and Z operators anti-commute, a star and plaquette have either zero or two edges in common, and thus the corresponding operators commute: H toric is a commuting Hamiltonian. As a consequence, all local terms are simultaneously diagonalizable, and any state in the diagonalizing eigenbasis either fully satisfies or fully violates any of the constraints. Although it may seem that this brings us back to a classical constraint satisfaction scenario, we will soon see that this is quite far from being the case.</p><p>We now describe a groundstate which is a 1 eigenstate of all plaquette and star operators. This is an example of one state in the four dimensional groundspace of the toric codes. Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">|Ω ∝ loops s |s , (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where the sum is taken over all computational basis states associated with n-bit strings s such that s is a (generalized) loop: the set of edges in the lattice to which s associates a 1 forms a disjoint union of loops, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>, and we allow loops to wrap around the torus. To see that B s leaves |Ω intact, it suffices to show that B s leaves any loop s intact. This follows from the fact that the four Z operators forming any B s intersect a loop in an even number of positions, hence the (-1) signs due to the action of the Z's systematically cancel out. For the A p , a somewhat more subtle argument (which we leave as a nice exercise) shows that applying A p on |Ω simply results in a permutation of the order of summation over loops.</p><p>We can now point to some remarkable properties of any groundstate of the toric code. First we note that applying X operators along any contractible closed loop, as in the left part of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(b)</ref>, is equivalent to applying all the A p 's of the plaquettes enclosed by the loop. To see this, use that X 2 = I, so applying A p on two adjacent plaquettes cancels the X on their intersection. Since any groundstate is invariant under the A p , any such operator leaves it invariant! This is a uniquely quantum phenomenon, since in the classical world clearly no non-trivial error could leave a string invariant. However, notice that this property is not unique to the toric code -flipping all the bits in the CAT state |Ψ + CAT also leaves it invariant. Now comes a more surprising property: the relation to the topology of the torus. Notice that the above argument holds only for a loop that can be made out of plaquettes, namely, that is contractible. What happens if one applies a sequence of X along a loop which wraps around the torus (see, for example, the right part of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>)? In that case, the previous argument does not hold -but we can argue that the resulting state remains a groundstate! Indeed, as before the intersection of such a loop with any star is even, and thus it commutes with H torus ; this means that it keeps the groundspace invariant. Operators on non-contractible loops can indeed be used to move between different groundstates.</p><p>The 4 dimensional groundspace of the toric code can be used as a quantum error correcting code that encodes 2 qubits; its error correction properties are tightly related to the topological Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: (a) Comparing two product states on two registers, locally. (b) Two globally entangled states on two separate registers cannot be compared locally, but when the two states are in superposition on the same register, comparison can be done through a local check of the additional control qubit entangled to that register.</p><p>properties described above, and its states are all locally indistinguishable, hence globally entangled (we will touch upon this again later, in Section 4). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">12</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Entanglement and local CSPs</head><p>Armed with some insight into how complex and beautiful multipartite entanglement can be, we proceed to explain how it affects the picture in the context of CSPs.</p><p>A crucial ingredient in all results related to classical CSPs, and in particular in the Cook-Levin theorem and the PCP theorem, is the ability to verify that a computation is carried out correctly by local checks. It is useful to think in this context of a computation that does nothing: all one needs to verify is that a string has not changed. Classically, this can easily be done by comparing the strings bit by bit.</p><p>What happens in the quantum world? First note that it is possible to design a local Hamiltonian that "checks" if two product states,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">|φ = |φ 1 ⊗ • • • ⊗ |φ n and |φ = |φ 1 ⊗ • • • ⊗ |φ n ,</formula><p>are the same. For each pair of matching qubits introduce a local term which projects on the subspace orthogonal to the symmetric subspace (the space spanned by |00 , |01 +|10 , |11 ) of the two qubits (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref>). The state |φ ⊗ |φ will be in the null space of all the projections (namely, a ground state of energy 0) iff the two states are the same.</p><p>Difficulties arise when trying to design a local Hamiltonian that checks that two entangled states are identical. Recall from the example of the CAT state that there exists orthogonal states, whose reduced density matrices on any strict subset of the n qubits are identical. Since the energy of any local Hamiltonian term only depends on those reduced density matrices, no such Hamiltonian can possibly distinguish between the two states. This is the crux of the global-vs-local problem in quantum constraint satisfaction problems: it limits our ability to locally enforce even such simple constraints as the identity constraint. This difficulty will arise as an important stumbling block in the next section, where we discuss extensions of the Cook-Levin and PCP theorems to Hamiltonian complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Quantizing CSP results: The local versus global problem 3.1 The quantum Cook-Levin theorem</head><p>The local Hamiltonian problem is for QMA what SAT is for NP -it is a complete problem for the class. The easy direction states that the k-Local Hamiltonian problem is in QMA for any constant k: verifying that the ground energy of a given LH is smaller than a can be performed in quantum polynomial time given the appropriate witness. The idea is quite simple: the witness is an eigenstate |ξ of energy lower than a, which we are promised to exist. The verifier can estimate the energy E = m i=1 ξ|H i |ξ by picking a local term H i at random and measuring the witness state |ξ using the two-outcome projective measurement {H i , I -H i }. The probability that he obtains the outcome associated with H i is exactly the average energy ε/m, which can be estimated to within inverse polynomial accuracy by repeating the procedure sufficiently many times.</p><p>The other direction, encoding any QMA language L as an instance of LH, is more interesting. Let us first recall the proof of the classical Cook-Levin theorem. Let L be a language in NP: there is a polynomial-time Turing machine M which operates on the input x and a witness y, and is such that M (x, y) accepts if and only if x ∈ L. The main idea to reduce this problem to a local SAT formula is to introduce a T × (T + 1) table encoding the history of the computation of M from time 0 to time T . For each location 1 ≤ i ≤ T on the tape and time 0 ≤ t ≤ T introduce a variable X i,t which is a triple of a tape symbol, a state of the machine, and a Boolean value indicating whether the head is at that location or not. The key point is that checking that the table of X i,t encodes a valid computation can be performed locally. Constraints in the SAT formula will involve groups of four variables X t,i-1 , X t,i , X t,i+1 and X i,t+1 and enforce that the state associated with the latter is a correct result of running M for one step on the state described by the three former variables. Verifying that the column at T = 0 corresponds to a valid initial state, and the column at time T corresponds to an accepting state, can also be performed locally.</p><p>Suppose now that L ∈ QMA: there exists a quantum circuit using two-qubit gates, say U 1 , ..., U T , which accepts an input x with probability exponentially close to 1 provided it is run on the appropriate witness |ξ if x ∈ L, and rejects with probability exponentially close to 1 if x ∈ L, whatever the witness. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">13</ref> Drawing from the Cook-Levin proof, a natural attempt to encode this computation into an instance of LH would be to introduce the sequence of history states of the computation Moving forward, to verify that |ψ = U |ψ for some local unitary U we may construct a local projection P which acts both on the control qubit and the qubits of U , and whose null space is spanned by the state |ψ ⊗ |0 + U |ψ ⊗ |1 / √ 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Dinur's proof of the PCP theorem</head><p>We now proceed to an exposition of Dinur's proof <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> of the PCP theorem. The proof is based on a general technique called gap amplification. Given an instance C of some k-local CSP, and an assignment σ to the variables of C, define the unsat-value UNSAT σ (C) of C with respect to σ as the fraction of clauses of C that are not satisfied by σ. Define the unsat-value of C, UNSAT(C), as the minimum over all σ of UNSAT σ (C). The Cook-Levin theorem states that it is NP-hard to distinguish between UNSAT(C) = 0 and UNSAT(C) ≥ 1/m, where m is the number of clauses in C. Dinur's proof describes a polynomial-time procedure mapping any instance C to an instance C such that, if UNSAT(C) = 0 then UNSAT(C ) = 0 as well, but whenever UNSAT(C) &gt; 0, then UNSAT(C ) ≥ γ for some universal constant γ &gt; 0 (depending only on the class of CSPs from which C is taken). In with Def. 1.1, we will refer to γ as the relative promise gap, or simply as the promise gap.</p><p>We focus on CSPs defined on a graph G = (V, E), called a constraint graph. These are 2-local CSPs defined on variables which can be assigned a constant number of values d (we say that the CSP is defined over an alphabet of size d). Each vertex in G corresponds to a variable, and each edge to a constraint acting on the variables associated to its two adjacent vertices. Dinur's gap amplification theorem can be stated as follows.</p><p>Theorem 3.1 (Gap amplification -adapted from Theorem 1.5 in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) For any alphabet size d, there exist constants 0 &lt; γ &lt; 1 and C &gt; 1, together with an efficient algorithm that takes a constraint graph G = (V, E) with alphabet size d, and transforms it to another constraint graph G = (V , E ) with universal alphabet size d 0 such that the following holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">1. |E | ≤ C|E| and |V | ≤ C|V |, 2. (completeness) if UNSAT(G) = 0 then UNSAT(G ) = 0, 3. (soundness) if UNSAT(G) &gt; 0 then UNSAT(G ) ≥ min 2 • UNSAT(G), γ .</formula><p>Starting from a constraint graph associated to an instance of a NP-hard CSP (such as 3-coloring), the PCP theorem follows by applying the above theorem logarithmically many times.</p><p>Given an instance C, there is a simple way to perform gap amplification. For any integer t, construct a new instance C t which has the same variables as C but m t constraints corresponding to all possible conjunctions of t constraints drawn from C. It is easy to see that UNSAT(C t ) ≥ 1 -(1 -UNSAT(C)) t , but unfortunately, this construction has two main drawbacks. First, for t = Ω(m), which is needed to reach a constant promise gap, the number of constraints becomes exponential in m. Second, the locality of the constraints blows up by a multiplicative factor t.</p><p>At its core, Dinur's proof also uses repetition to achieve amplification, but it uses various techniques to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. The main idea is the use of expander graphs, which are low-degree graphs with the property that a random walk on the graph quickly (in a logarithmic number of steps) reaches the uniform distribution over all vertices. This suggests a more efficient way to perform gap amplification: instead of including all possible subsets of t constraints in C , only include constraints obtained as the conjunction of t clauses that form a path in the constraint graph. If the constraint graph is an expander, the property of rapid mixing will ensure that constraints constructed in this way are sufficiently well-distributed, so that the promise gap is amplified almost as much as in the previous construction. Moreover, provided the graph has constant degree D, the number of constraints will only be m • D t .</p><p>The above basic idea leaves us with two difficulties. First, the constraint graph should be an expander. Second, the above suggestion increases the locality of the system and replaces 2-local terms with t-local ones. Dinur's proof uses additional ideas to handle these issues. Altogether, it has three main steps: Preprocessing This step turns the constraint graph into an expander. The crucial part is called degree reduction, in which the local degree of every vertex is reduced to D 1 + 1 for some constant D 1 . This is achieved by replacing every vertex with degree &gt; D 1 + 1 with a cloud of vertices, one for each edge, connected by an expander of degree D 1 : their degree becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">D 1 + 1,</formula><p>where the extra 1 is due to the original, external, edge. Consistency between the new vertices is enforced by placing identity constraints on the edges of the expander.</p><p>Gap amplification This step uses the idea outlined above to amplify the gap using t-walks on the constraint graph. This most naturally leads to a constraint hypergraph, and Dinur's proof introduces additional ingredients (that we will not describe) to turn it again into a graph; once again, this part involves adding consistency constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alphabet reduction</head><p>The previous step leaves us with a constraint graph with an amplified promise gap, but alphabet size that is exponential in t (in fact, it is doubly exponential in t, due to the point in Gap amplification which we did not explain). To reduce this, Dinur uses a construction known as assignment tester <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>; it is also known by the name of PCP of proximity <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>. This transformation uses error correcting codes to transform any set of constraints into a larger set of constraints on a larger number of variables, but such that the variables now range over an alphabet of constant size d 0 . Constraints are added to check that the assignment is really a word in the code. The code must thus be locally testable, meaning that if the assignment is far from satisfying it will necessarily violate many constraints.</p><p>We remark that the first and last steps reduce the promise gap by constant factors (which is of course something we want to avoid), but by choosing a sufficiently large (yet constant) t in the second step the overall promise gap is still amplified. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Trying to quantize Dinur's construction</head><formula xml:id="formula_19">QUNSAT ψ (H G ) := ψ|H|ψ m = 1 m m i=1 ψ|H i |ψ .

The unsat-value of H G is then the minimum unsat over all states, which by definition is reached by the groundstate |Ω of H G , and therefore QUNSAT(H G ) = E 0 /m, where E 0 is the ground state energy.</p><p>With this analogy, one is tempted to find quantum analogues of the three steps in Dinur's proof. In light of Sec. 2.3 this seems a nontrivial task. Take, for example, the degree reduction part in the preprocessing step of Dinur's proof. Classically, one replaces a vertex with D 1 edges by a cloud of D 1 vertices with identity tests between them. How can we achieve that quantumly, if different registers cannot be compared locally? Similar difficulties arise in the other steps: in all these steps new variables are introduced and consistency checks are added.</p><p>So far the only aspect of the proof that has been successfully "imported" to the quantum setting is the gap amplification by t-walks on expanders <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. This is the quantum analogue of the hypergraph construction that was described in the previous subsection. In the quantum analogue, the new quantum constraint defined on a t-walk is the conjunction of all the old constraints along the twalk, namely, its null space is defined as the intersection of all the null spaces of the old constraints. The proof that this indeed amplifies the gap is non-trivial, and requires much technical work, but the point is that in this construction the configuration space remains the same; no new variables are introduced, and no consistency checks are needed.</p><p>One is tempted to try to solve the consistency problem in the same way it was solved in the case of the quantum Cook-Levin proof, as explained in Subsection 3.1. All attempts to do it have so far resulted in a severe decrease of the promise gap. Another direction, which was already mentioned in Sec. 1.2, is the notion of quantum gadgets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>. Such gadgets might seem like the kind of tool we are looking for, as they allow moving from k-local to 2-local Hamiltonians while not changing the groundstate too much. However, since they increase the number of terms and their norm by a constant factor, this results in an unmanageable decrease of the promise gap γ → γ poly(k) . The difficulties described above have sometimes been attributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> to the no-cloning theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>, which asserts that unknown quantum states cannot be copied. However, no-cloning only applies to unitary transformations; there is no reason to require the quantum PCP transformation from the groundstate of H to that of H to be a quantumly implementable map. It seems that a more fundamental issue is the impossibility of comparing two states that are supposed to be equal, locally, or have some generalization of such a procedure (such as degree reduction without consistency checks, or an encoding by a quantum error correcting code) without harming the promise gap significantly.</p><p>We conclude this section with a remark about the qPCP conjecture and quantum error corrections codes (QECC). In classical PCP proofs, one often uses some sort of error correction codes to encode the initial configuration space and the initial constraints. The encoded CSP will have two types of local constraints; one to check that we are inside the code, and a second to check that the original constraints are satisfied. Quantumly, however, this seems impossible. Even though we do have quantum codes which can be specified by local constraints (e.g., the toric code), it is by definition impossible for local tests to distinguish between different words inside the code by local measurements -a property that is necessary for protecting the information from being destroyed by local interactions with the environment (See footnote 12).</p></div>

Intuitively, monogamy states that a particle cannot be highly entangled simultaneously to many other particles. The more particles it is entangled to, the less it is entangled with each particle.

Indeed, first note that even if all parameters appearing as denominators in (6) take their maximal value, we have η ≤ C( log(d)d 6 2D ) 1 8 &lt; Cd/D 1/8 . We can assume without loss of generality that d/D 1/8 &lt; 1/2, since we can always increase D by adding O(|E|) edges to the graph with trivial projections whose energy is always 0. This would decrease the promise gap by at most a constant factor. Let us now assume that there exists an efficient mapping that takes a constraint graph with particle dimension d and local degree D, and transforms it into a new constraint graph G with local dimension d 2 and local degree D 2 , without decreasing the promise gap. 17 Speaking loosely, such a reduction will take η → 1  2 η, and applying it t = O(log(δ -1 )) times, where γ is the initial promise gap, we will get η &lt; γ, which would place the problem inside NP. Together with the fact already mentioned in the introduction, that qPCP for k-local Hamiltonians implies qPCP for 2-local Hamiltonians, we arrive at the following corollary: <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>) The existence of an efficient classical reduction that takes a quantum constraint graph with particle dimension d and local degree D to a new constraint graph with particle dimension at most d 2 and degree at least D 2 without decreasing the promise gap is incompatible with the qPCP conjecture being true.</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Corollary 3.3 (Adapted from</formula><p>We notice that in the classical world, such a mapping exists trivially.

Moreover, these constructions are the bread-and-butter of classical PCP proofs. In fact, a closer inspection of Dinur's PCP proof reveals that the second step in her gap amplification theorem is exactly such a reduction! 18 We arrive at a paradoxical situation in which quantizing the second step of Dinur's proof would imply that qPCP does not hold.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Further limitations on NLTS: the commuting case</head><p>What makes the situation in the case of CLHs simpler is a fundamental structure lemma due to Bravyi and Vyalyi (BV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, which we now describe. They consider the case when H is 2-local, described by a graph G = (V, E), with particles siting on the vertices and local terms on the edges. Consider then a d-dimensional particle on a vertex v whose local degree is D, so that there are D local terms that act on the particle. BV show that in some sense these terms can be viewed as acting on D different, disjoint "subparticles". Formally, they show that the Hilbert space W (v)  of the particle at v can be written as a direct sum of orthogonal subspaces,</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">W (v) = μ W (v)</formula><p>μ , which are invariant under the action of all local terms in the Hamiltonian.

Applying this decomposition to all particles, if we project into a specific W (v) μ for every vertex v, we get a completely decoupled system, made of disjoint terms each acting on two subparticles, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b)</ref>. Using this, Bravyi-Vyalyi <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref> find an eigenbasis of trivial eigenvectors, each one generated by a depth-2 quantum circuit.

We conclude that 2-local CLH cannot be used to prove the NLTS conjecture.</p><p>The above lemma puts strong constraints on CLHs; it has many applications. For example, Aharonov and Eldar <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref> extended it to any 3-local Hamiltonian acting on 2 or 3-dimensional parti-cles. Hastings <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> extended it to CLHs defined on certain hypergraphs, characterized by continuous maps on simplicial complexes; he also extended this to very general planar CLHs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>. Arad <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> considered slightly non-commuting 2-local systems as perturbations of commuting systems, showing that also these systems have trivial low-energy states.</p><p>One may ask whether trivial states can always be found when the underlying (hyper-)graph is a good enough expander, in analogy to the Brandão Harrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref> result (Sec. 3.4). Aharonov and Eldar <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> derive such a result in the CLH domain for any constant locality k; the notion of expansion however should be explained since we are talking about hypergraphs. Let us associate with the Hamiltonian a bipartite graph in a natural way: constraints are on one side and particles on the other and particles are connected to the constraints they participate in. The result of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> shows that if this bipartite graph is a good small-set-expander (namely, for any set of particles of size k, the set of constraints they are connected to has cardinality at least (1δ) times its maximal possible value kD where D is the number of constraints a qubit participates in) then trivial states exist below an energy which is of the order of δ. Just like in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, the better the expanders (namely, the smaller δ is) the less appropriate the graphs are for NLTS. It is somewhat difficult to compare the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref> since the notions of expander being used are very different (the usual notion cannot be used when discussing hypergraphs) but the spirit it the same: too good expanders will not help the qPCP.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Freedman-Hastings' construction</head><p>We conclude this section with a result that provides a new approach for proving the NLTS conjecture. In recent work Freedman and Hastings <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> considered extending the toric code from a 2-dimensional grid to a graph which satisfies a non-standard notion of hypergraph expansion, which they term non-k-hyperfinite. We will not explain this result in detail as it requires extensive topological and algebraic background. We will however attempt to give the flavor of the result.</p><p>Think of the following question. We have seen in Sec. 4.2 that the toric code's states are nontrivial, but as soon as we allow the energy to increase trivial states exist. What would happen if we allowed only one type of the operators, say, the plaquette operators, to be violated, while still requiring that all the star operators have 0 energy? We refer to this as a "one-sided error" NLTS. While the toric codes are not directly "one-sided error" NLTS, they can be extended in a sophisticated way to satisfy that property.</p><p>Let us first see why the toric code states are not one-sided NLTS. Consider partitioning the lattice of the toric code in × squares, for some constant , removing only the plaquette type operators acting on the corners on those squares. It can be easily checked that the remaining Hamiltonian is 2-local provided one aggregates together all qubits in each square to one big (but still of constant dimension) particle. The Bravyi-Vyalyi lemma of Sec. 4.2 can then be applied to derive trivial states whose sole non-zero energy contribution comes from the plaquette operators that were thrown away: they are one-sided, but trivial.</p><p>To construct one-sided NLTS, Freedman and Hastings introduce two types of terms, A and B, corresponding to products of X operators over "plaquettes" and Z operators over "stars" defined on the graphs they construct. The plaquettes, like in the toric codes, have 4 edges; the stars involve 6 edges. They show that no non-trivial state exists below a certain constant average energy, as long as one is allowed to violate only one type of operator. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">23</ref>It is interesting to see what the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> described in the previous subsection implies regarding the construction of Freedman and Hastings <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, since those are set on graphs which are supposedly good expanders. Applied to the bipartite graph corresponding to the Freedman-Hastings construction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> implies that trivial groundstates of the system of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> exist below some constant average energy γ 0 . This constant fraction tends to 0 as the small-set expansion of the graphs underlying the construction improves; In similar spirit to the final conclusion of Subsection 3.4, one cannot hope to improve the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> and achieve NLTS Hamiltonians by taking better and better small-set expanders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Interactive proofs and qPCP</head><p>In searching for a quantum equivalent to the PCP theorem it may be useful to look back at the classical theorem's origins in this innovative line of work. From their introduction in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, interactive proofs were soon discovered to capture increasingly complex problems, from the successive inclusions of coNP <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref>, PH <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and finally PSPACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> in IP, and culminating in the discovery of the surprising power of multiple provers revealed by the equation MIP = NEXP <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It is the "scaling down" of the latter result from NEXP to NP, obtained by placing stringent resource bounds on the verifier, that eventually led to the PCP theorem. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_14">24</ref>Just as it was instrumental in bringing forth the very notion of locally checkable proofs, the perspective given by interactive proof systems might also help shed light on the qPCP conjecture in its proof verification form (Conjecture 1.4). In fact, attempting to directly approach the random access version of the qPCP, Conjecture 1.4, may be easier than tackling its gap amplification version, Conjecture 1.3, as the former follows from the latter by a classical reduction, whereas the other direction seems to require a quantum reduction.</p><p>We start by describing an exponential size classical PCP for QMA. The derivation of such exponential size PCPs was an important milestone on the route towards the PCP theorem (Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, chapter 11), and despite being much simpler they do provide important intuition towards the polynomial size proof. We next move on to the study of multiprover interactive proofs, which were instrumental in the proof of the PCP theorem, and ask whether a similar relationship can be established between qPCP and interactive proofs with multiple entangled provers. The connection does not hold in the quantum case, but the endeavor reveals another interesting aspect of entanglement: the possibility of using its nonlocal correlations to defeat classical multiprover interactive proof systems. This opens up several interesting open questions related to entanglement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">An exponential classical PCP for QMA</head><p>At first sight, it might seem that devising an exponential-size classical witness for an instance of LH is a trivial task: why not simply use the classical description of the quantum witness as a list of 2 n coefficients (up to some precision), one per computational basis state? The problem lies in efficiently verifying that this state has low energy with respect to the Hamiltonian. Suppose for example that one of the local terms is a projection of the first qubit on the state |1 . The associated energy is the probability to measure the first qubit of the witness in state |1 , the sum over all coefficients (squared) of computational states labeled by a 1 in the first position. Evaluating this sum requires access to an exponential number of coefficients. As we can see, the locality of the Hamiltonian does not translate to a locality in terms of the classical description of the state.</p><p>This difficulty suggests a different witness, for which the problem mentioned above does not arise: the witness would be the list of all local density matrices associated to the groundstate on any subset of k qubits. Such a witness has polynomial size, which should make us suspicious. Indeed, the difficulty here is that checking consistency between different reduced local density matrices, namely, that they come from a single quantum state, is itself a QMA-hard problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref>! This approach seems to be a dead end.</p><p>However, the following line of argument shows that the ingredients required to devise such exponentially long proofs for QMA were long known to exist. First, it is known that QMA ⊆ PSPACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57]</ref>. Second, PSPACE = IP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> can be used to derive QMA ⊆ IP and thus any language in QMA has an efficient interactive proof. Finally, any interactive proof can be made into a static, exponentially longer proof, as follows. The static "proof" lists the whole tree of answers the prover would give to the verifier's queries. A verifier checking the proof, based on the first query that is made, partitions the proof into sub-proofs, only one of which will be explored by subsequent queries. This proves that exponentially long classical PCPs for QMA exist. We feel, however, that it is insightful to "open" the above line of arguments and see what it may teach us in relation to qPCP. In the next subsection we describe the IP proof of QMA, from which an exponentially long proof can be derived in a straightforward manner.</p><p>It is worthwhile noting that the resulting proof does not explicitly encode the quantum witness, but instead directly works with the local Hamiltonian. In a sense, our proof is a step away from natural attempts at quantizing the classical PCP transformations; taking such a step is motivated in part by Corollary 3.3, which indicates that the most "natural" transformations may fail in the quantum setting.</p></div>

The reason it is difficult to compute the trace of A is the fact that it involves high powers of H, which eliminate its local nature. This is the task we are confronting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">An interactive proof for the trace</head><p>Let us simplify the problem further and assume we are given a real symmetric matrix A such that we have a way to efficiently compute any diagonal entry of A. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_16">26</ref>Taking inspiration from the proof that PSPACE ⊆ IP, but simplifying to the maximum, a first naïve attempt at giving an interactive proof for the statement "Tr(A) = a" could be as follows. The verifier will ask the prover to provide answers to random questions; based on the prover's answers, he will ask further questions. The prover does not know the next question when answering the previous one, and so if the claim he is trying to prove is wrong, his answers will have to be inconsistent, and he will be caught. Let A 00 be the 2 n-1 × 2 n-1 submatrix of A corresponding to its top left block, and A 11 corresponding to the bottom right block (one can think of this as projecting the first qubit out of n to the state |0 or |1 ). The verifier first asks the prover for two numbers, a c ". After n steps, we have arrived at a submatrix of size 2 n-n , which is a single diagonal entry and can be checked by itself.</p><p>The above described procedure, however, is not sound: the prover can cheat and be caught with only exponentially small probability. For example, assume the all diagonal entries are 1 except for one of them, which is 2. The correct trace is 2 n + 1, but the prover wants to convince the verifier the trace is 2 n . To do that, the prover could declare a = a (0) = 2 n . To be consistent, in the next step he declares a  0 (this depends on the location of the entry '2' in the matrix) corresponds to the correct trace of the corresponding block matrix, here A 0 ; but the other does not. If the verifier chose the value c = 0, the prover is safe and can be truthful in the remainder of the protocol. Otherwise, he is back to the previous case. Thus, at each iteration, the prover has probability half to "escape" and can proceed truthfully from there.</p><p>The sum-check protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the main ingredient in the IP = PSPACE proof, suggests a particular way around this issue. Roughly, the idea is to introduce redundancy by defining a multilinear polynomial encoding the diagonal elements of A, and extending the field over which the polynomial is defined from F 2 (the values of the coin in the protocol above) to the finite field F p = {0, . . . , p-1}, where p 2 n . The verifier is assumed to be able to evaluate the polynomial at a random point x ∈ F n p . The idea is that soundness follows from the fact that two such polynomials cannot agree on too many values without being equal. Notice that the polynomial evaluations are equivalent to computing specific linear combinations of the diagonal entries of A.</p><p>We introduce here a slightly different form of redundancy in the protocol. Although conceptually the idea is the same, we feel that it is more natural to the present setting. The proof will rely on the verifier's ability to directly verify, not only diagonal entries of A in the computational basis, but diagonal entries of A in any (suitably discretized) product basis. In other words, we now provide an IP proof for the trace of a 2 n × 2 n real matrix A, assuming that the verifier knows how to compute the value of</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">A θ 1 •••θn = θ 1 • • • θ n |A|θ 1 • • • θ n</formula><p>where here θ i ∈ {0, 2π/p, . . . , 2π(1 -1/p)} are arbitrary with satisfaction of the first provers' answers, implies that, provided the provers are accepted with high probability, the second provers' assignment must satisfy most clauses of ϕ .</p><p>Interestingly, this correspondence between locally checkable proofs and multiprover interactive proof systems completely breaks down in the case of quantum proofs. To see why, let's try to make an instance of the k-local Hamiltonian problem into a two-prover interactive proof system in a similar manner as we did for instances of k-SAT. The natural idea would be to ask each player to hold a copy of the groundstate |Ψ . The referee would then choose one of the terms H i of the Hamiltonian at random, and ask the first prover to hand him the k qubits on which H i acts. He would then choose one of these k qubits at random, and ask the second prover to provide it. Upon receiving the qubits, the verifier can, either evaluate the energy of these qubits with respect to H i , or check consistency between the second prover's qubit and the matching qubit from the first prover's answer...or can he? There is a serious issue with this procedure of course, an issue we encountered many times before. Because of the possible presence of entanglement in the groundstate, it could be that the states held by cheating provers are very different (even just on k of the qubits) but, on any one qubit, they are identical: it is impossible to check consistency between each provers' "proofs" by a local procedure. 27  We are stuck -there does not seem to be a straightforward notion of a quantum multiprover interactive proof that would capture the qPCP, as formulated in Conjecture 1.4, as classical interactive proof systems capture the classical PCP. Nevertheless, our attempts provided a glimpse of a new model of interactive proofs, in which the provers may be entangled, which is of its own interest as it provides insights into the power of entanglement in proofs from a different perspective. Formally, the class MIP * was defined by Cleve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref> as the class of languages that can be verified by a classical polynomial-time verifier with the help of two all-powerful, untrusted but non-communicating, quantum entangled provers. 28  What can be said about this class? Interestingly, the classical inequality MIP = NEXP does not carry any non-trivial implication for the power of MIP * , in neither direction . Indeed, the trivial inclusion MIP ⊆ NEXP does not carry over, as there is no a priori bound on the dimension, or complexity, of quantum strategies for the provers. The reason the converse inclusion NEXP ⊆ MIP does not carry over automatically can already be found in the work of John Bell in the 1960s <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref> related to the EPR states mentioned in Subsection 2.1: while the quantum provers still do not communicate, they can use their entangled state to generate correlations (joint distributions on their answers to the verifier's queries) that cannot be simulated using shared randomness alone. In a recent result <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref> Ito and Vidick showed that Babai et al.'s multilinearity test, a key test in the proof of MIP = NEXP, is robust to entanglement: the test remains sound even when executed with quantum provers. Using this they showed that NEXP ⊆ MIP * : allowing the provers to be entangled does not reduce the expressivity of the class.</p><p>But can it increase it? One of the most intriguing open questions about entanglement is to provide any upper bound on this class; The problem in providing such a bound is that even though 27 There are many other difficulties: for instance, we have no guarantee that, when asked for qubits i or j, the second prover actually sends us distinct qubits. An even more basic problem is that there is no quantum procedure that can compare two quantum states (even by acting globally) -such a procedure only exists for the case of pure, not mixed, states. 28 One could also consider the class QMIP * in which the verifier is also allowed to be quantum, and exchange quantum messages with the provers. However, it was recently shown that QMIP * = MIP * <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref>. Just as for singleprover interactive proofs, in which QIP = IP <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>, the use of quantum messages does not bring additional power in this setting.</p><p>the provers only exchange polynomially many bits with the verifier, no bound on the amount of entanglement that they are using is known; for all we know, they might need to use doublyexponentially many EPR pairs, or more.</p><p>Despite the difficulty in directly connecting the multiprover model to the quantum PCP conjecture as formulated in Conjecture 1.4, one may still be able to derive interesting results regarding qPCP from the study of MIP * . Such a result was recently derived by Vidick <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>, obtaining a different quantum equivalent to the classical PCP theorem, using its formulation in terms of multiplayer games. Classically, this formulation states that it is NP-hard to determine whether some 2-player games (such as the k-SAT game described) can be won with probability 1, or at most some constant. Vidick proved that NP-hardness still holds even if the players are quantum and are allowed to be entangled. The proof builds on showing that the low-degree tests, used in the original proof of the PCP theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> possess some "robustness" properties -are sound even when the provers are allowed to use entanglement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Concluding remarks</head><p>This column is full of open problems, and so there is no need to repeat those. We highlight several problems not encountered in the text:</p><p>• QMA: Perhaps there is a better characterization of QMA that would make the qPCP conjecture more accessible? That the current formulation is not optimal might be hinted to by the fact that most questions on this class are still open (including the analogue of the Valiant-Vazirani theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[63]</ref>, the question of whether one sided and two sided errors are equivalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>, etc).</p><p>• Quantum locally testable codes (qLTCs): A locally testable code (LTC) guarantees that if a word is very far from the code, a random local test will detect it with good probability (this is referred to as the code being "robust"). LTC codes such as the Hadamard and the long code have played a crucial role in the classical PCP proof <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>; their quantum version was defined in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> were weak bounds on the robustness of any qLTC were given. Does a qLTC with constant robustness exist? The question can be shown to be tightly related to the NLTS conjecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>; however, its direct connection to qPCP is yet to be clarified, since as was explained at the end of Sec. 3.3, quantum error correction codes cannot be used in a straight forward manner for proving the qPCP conjecture.</p><p>• Efficient description of quantum states: Even if the NLTS conjecture holds, one would need a stronger version of it to be relevant for the qPCP: in fact, the qPCP requires that the low energy states of the output Hamiltonians cannot have an efficient classical description. Non-triviality of the states is not sufficient; see for example Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37]</ref> which provide such efficient descriptions for non-trivial states. A major thread in quantum Hamiltonian complexity is finding efficient classical descriptions of quantum states via the notion of tensor networks, a particular graphical representation of vectors (or operators). Understanding the conditions under which such efficient descriptions exist is thus of high relevance.</p><p>• Entangled provers: As we saw in Sec. 5.2, the tight connection that exists in the classical setting between locally checkable proofs, constraint satisfaction problems and multiprover interactive proofs breaks down in the quantum setting: locally checkable proofs can no longer be consistently shared between two provers. Although the formal connection seems to be lost, it may nevertheless be fruitful to examine questions on the one aspect in light of progress on the other. Does the recent proof <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref> that NEXP ⊆ MIP * have any implications for qPCP? Could it be that QMA EXP , the exponentially scaled-up analogue of QMA, is included in MIP * ? Indeed, no upper bounds on the latter class are known -none at all.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) The plaquette operator A p and the star operator B s .

However, as we have seen in Subsection 2.3, this approach is hopeless: it is simply impossible to use local tests to compare different registers.Luckily, entanglement, which is the source of the problem, will also help us solve it. Consider in which the states |ψ and |ψ are held in the same register and entangled to an additional control qubit (see Fig.2(b)). When |ψ = |ψ , |η factorizes as |η = |ψ ⊗ (|0 + |1 )/ √ 2; the control qubit becomes unentangled from the first register. Therefore, if we wish to verify that |ψ = |ψ , all we have to do is make sure that the control qubit is in the state (|0 + |1 )/ √ 2, and this can be done by a local projection on the control qubit (rather than on the states themselves!).</figDesc><table><row><cell>the superposition</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>|η =</cell><cell>1 √ 2</cell><cell>|ψ ⊗ |0 + |ψ ⊗ |1 ,</cell></row></table></figure>

The verifier first asks the prover for three values a <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> 0 , a <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> 1 , and a <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> 2 . As before, a <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> 0 is supposed to equal Tr(A 00 ) and a <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> 1 is supposed to equal Tr(A 11 ); the additional value is supposed to equal Tr(A 01 + A 10 ), the trace of the sum of the off-diagonal sub-blocks of A. The verifier first checks that a <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> 0 + a (1) 1 = a (1) := a, namely, that the trace of the entire matrix equals the sum of the claimed traces of the blocks. He then selects a random number θ 1 ∈ {0, 2π/p, . . . , 2π(1 -1/p)} and (formally) defines the matrix</p><p>This corresponds to projecting the first qubit on the state |θ 1 and then tracing this qubit out and considering only the matrix of the remaining qubits. The verifier then defines a (2) </p><p>which is what he would expect the trace of the matrix A θ 1 to be, if the a</p><p>b 's were correct. He then recursively applies the protocol to check the correctness of the statement "Tr(A θ 1 ) = a (2) ". At the ith step, he verifies the statement "Tr(A θ 1 ...θ i-1 ) = a (i) ", where he previously calculated a (i) by</p><p>He does that by asking for values a</p><p>b , with b = 0, 1, 2, which are the traces of the 00, 11 and 01 + 10 blocks of A θ 1 ...θ i-1 , and checking that a (i) . Finally after the n'th step he verifies "Tr(A θ 1 ...θn ) = a (n+1) ", (with a (n+1) defined using Eq. (8) as well). For this he uses Tr(A</p><p>which consists in a single diagonal entry of A in a randomly chosen product basis, which, we assume, he can calculate by himself.</p><p>Why is this protocol sound? Let us assume the prover is cheating and consider some run of the protocol. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ n be the largest integer at which at least one of the three values returned by the prover, a</p><p>) respectively. By definition, in all following steps the values claimed by the prover are correct. In particular, the three values a (i+1) b that he gives the verifier are the actual traces of the blocks of A θ 1 •••θ i , and therefore a</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Now, recall that what the verifier actually checks is a</head><p>= a (i+1) , which he assigned to be equal to a</p><p>2 cos θ i sin θ i in the previous step. Thus he will not detect the cheating iff the quadratic expression</p><p>vanishes at X = cos θ i and Y = sin θ i . But since the prover was not honest on the ith round, then at least one of the coefficients of the quadratic is non-zero. Using the fact that a nontrivial $&amp;0 6,*$&amp;7 1HZV -XQH YRO QR quadratic curve aX 2 + bXY + cY 2 = 0 intersects the unit circle X 2 + Y 2 = 1 in at most two points, we find that there are only two possible values out of the p that θ i can take in order to pass the test. Since the prover may attempt to lie (or repair a previous lie) at any step of the protocol, by the union bound he will be able to cheat with probability at most n • (2/p). Taking p to be large enough, the soundness of the protocol can be made exponentially small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">The final IP proof</head><p>We are almost done with the proof, but for one difficulty -we do not know how to compute coefficients of A , even at product states, efficiently. This computation itself will have to be part of the proof. Luckily, it is not very different from computing the trace. We will do this by induction, computing entries for A , assuming that entries for A -1 are already known, with the help of the prover. For that matter, it is not enough to consider diagonal terms; since we are interested in diagonal elements of products of matrices, all elements, including off diagonal ones enter the exponential sum.</p><p>The following claim can be proved by induction: The verifier can compute any entry</p><p>his choice, where A j is as defined in Subsection 5.1.1, for some j between 0 and n, with the help of the prover. The idea is that this entry can be written, in great similarity to the trace, as an exponential sum of entries,</p><p>where the sum is taken over a basis of product states |θ 1 ⊗ .. ⊗ |θ n ; We can thus assume by induction that the entries in this sum can be computed (with the help of the prover). It is now quite straightforward to generalize the proof of the previous subsection to this setting; in this case queries to the prover will take the form of values which are the trace of the 2</p><p>where each of the two terms is defined in analogy with the definition of A θ 1 , etc., in the previous section, and j runs from 1 to , k from 1 to n. The final calculation required of the verifier is that of values θ 1 • • • θ n |A 1 |θ 1 . . . θ n (at pairs of random product states).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">The two-provers angle</head><p>We concentrate on an idea which played a very important role in the path towards the PCP theorem, its direct correspondence with multiprover interactive proofs. To see the connection, let us take the example of k-SAT (though any k -CSP would do). The PCP theorem implies that any k-SAT formula ϕ can be transformed into another formula ϕ over polynomially many more variables such that, if ϕ is satisfiable then so is ϕ , but if ϕ is not satisfiable then at most 99% of the clauses of ϕ can be simultaneously satisfied. Hence there is an efficiently verifiable proof for the satisfiability of ϕ: simply ask for an assignment to the variables of ϕ satisfying as many clauses as possible. The verifier will pick 200 clauses at random, read off the corresponding at most 200k variables from the proof, and accept if and only if the assignment satisfies all 200 clauses.</p><p>We can make this proof checking procedure into a two-prover interactive proof system as follows: the verifier chooses a clause of ϕ at random, and asks a first prover for an assignment to its variables. He also chooses a single one of the variables appearing in the clause, and asks the second prover about it. He accepts if and only if the first prover's answers satisfy the clause, and the second prover's answer is consistent with the first. It is this consistency check that allows to relate any strategy of the provers to a proof: since the second prover only ever gets asked about single variables, his strategy is an assignment to the variables. Consistency with the first prover, together</p></div>			</div>
