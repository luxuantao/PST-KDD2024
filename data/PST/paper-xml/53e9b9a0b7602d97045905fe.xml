<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>There are many communication imperfections in networked control systems (NCS) such as varying transmission delays, varying sampling/transmission intervals, packet loss, communication constraints and quantization effects. Most of the available literature on NCS focuses on only some of these aspects, while ignoring the others. In this paper we present a general framework that incorporates communication constraints, varying transmission intervals and varying delays. Based on a newly developed NCS model including all these network phenomena, we will provide an explicit construction of a continuum of Lyapunov functions. Based on this continuum of Lyapunov functions we will derive bounds on the maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI) and the maximally allowable delay (MAD) that guarantee stability of the NCS in the presence of communication constraints.

After considering stability, we also study semi-global practical stability (under weaker conditions) and performance of the NCS in terms of</p><p>gains from disturbance inputs to controlled outputs. The developed results lead to tradeoff curves between MATI, MAD and performance gains that depend on the used protocol. These tradeoff curves provide quantitative information that supports the network designer when selecting appropriate networks and protocols guaranteeing stability and a desirable level of performance, while being robust to specified variations in delays and transmission intervals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>N ETWORKED control systems (NCS) have received con- siderable attention in recent years. The interest for NCS is motivated by many benefits they offer such as the ease of maintenance and installation, the large flexibility and the low cost. However, still many issues need to be resolved before all the advantages of wired and wireless networked control systems can be harvested. Next to improvements in the communication infrastructure itself, there is a need for control algorithms that can deal with communication imperfections and constraints. This latter aspect is recognized widely in the control community, as evidenced by the many publications appearing recently, see e.g., the overview papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>Roughly speaking, the network-induced imperfections and constraints can be categorized in five types:</p><p>(i) Quantization errors in the signals transmitted over the network due to the finite word length of the packets; (ii) Packet dropouts caused by the unreliability of the network; (iii) Variable sampling/transmission intervals; (iv) Variable communication delays; (v) Communication constraints caused by the sharing of the network by multiple nodes and the fact that only one node is allowed to transmit its packet per transmission. It is well known that the presence of these network phenomena can degrade the performance of the control loop significantly and can even lead to instability, see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for an illustrative example. Therefore, it is of importance to understand how these phenomena influence the closed-loop stability and performance properties, preferably in a quantitative manner. Unfortunately, much of the available literature on NCS considers only some of above mentioned types of network phenomena, while ignoring the other types. There are, for instance, systematic approaches that analyse stability of NCSs subject to only one of these network-induced imperfections. Indeed, the effects of quantization are studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, of packet dropouts in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, of time-varying transmission intervals and delays in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, respectively, and of communication constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Since in any practical communication network all aforementioned network-induced imperfections are present, there is a need for analysis and synthesis methods including all these imperfections. This is especially of importance, because the design of a NCS often requires tradeoffs between the different types.</p><p>For instance, reducing quantization errors (and thus transmitting larger or more packets) typically results in larger transmission delays. To support the designers in making these tradeoffs, tools are needed that provide quantitative information on the consequences of each of the possible choices. However, less results are available that study combinations of these imperfections. References that simultaneously consider two types of network-induced limitations are <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>,</p><p>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> which are categorized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> consider imperfections of type (i), (iii), (v), <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> study simultaneously type (ii), (iii), (iv), <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> focusses on type (ii), (iii), (v), and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> incorporates type (i), (ii), and (iv).</p><p>In addition some of the approaches mentioned in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> that study varying transmission intervals and/or varying communication delays can be extended to include type (ii) phenomena as well by modeling dropouts as prolongations of the maximal transmission interval or delay (cf. also Remark II.4 below).</p><p>Another paper that studies three different types of network imperfections is written by <ref type="bibr">Chaillet and Bicchi [6]</ref>. This paper studies NCS involving both variable delays, variable transmission intervals and communication constraints, and uses a method for delay compensation. The delay compensation is based on sending a larger control packet to the plant containing not just one control value at one particular time instant, but containing a control signal valid for a given future time horizon. For this particular control scheme, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> provides bounds on the tolerable delays and transmission intervals such that stability of the NCS is guaranteed. Also in the present paper we will study NCS corrupted by varying delays, varying transmission intervals and communication constraints, while packet dropouts can be included as well (in the way explained in Remark II.4 below). In other words, this paper considers network-induced imperfections of type (iii), (iv) and (v). After developing a novel NCS model incorporating all these types of network phenomena, we will present allowable bounds on delays and transmission intervals guaranteeing both stability and performance of the NCS. However, in contrast with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we consider the more basic emulation approach in the spirit of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, which encompasses no specific delay compensation schemes. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is of interest, as it aims at allowing larger delays by including specific delay compensation schemes, at the cost of sending larger control-packets and requiring time-stamping of messages. The features of compensation and time-stamping of messages are not needed in our framework. Another distinction with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is related to the admissible protocols that schedule which node is allowed to transmit its packet at a transmission time. Our work applies for all protocols satisfying the UGES property (see below for an exact definition) and not only for so-called invariably UGES protocols (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), which exclude the commonly used Round-Robin (RR) protocol.</p><p>One of the main contributions of this paper is that we explicitly construct a continuum of Lyapunov functions based on the standard delay-free conditions as adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. This continuum of Lyapunov functions leads to tradeoff curves between the maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI) and the maximally allowable delay (MAD) guaranteeing stability of the NCS. These tradeoff curves will depend on the specific communication protocol used, so that they even allow for the comparison of different protocols. In addition to stability, which is only a basic property that has to be satisfied by the control loop, there are often additional requirements with respect to the performance of the NCS. This paper also studies the performance in terms of gains between specific exogenous inputs (e.g., disturbances) and controlled outputs of the system. We will show how performance of the NCS depends on the MATI, the MAD and the protocol used, leading to tradeoff curves as well. This design methodology and the method to compute the tradeoff curves will be demonstrated on the case study of the batch reactor that has developed over the years as a benchmark system for NCS, see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Next to stability and performance, also semiglobal practical stability results will be presented that can be obtained under weaker conditions.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. The current section will end with introducing some notational conventions and concepts. Next, in Section II we present a general NCS modeling framework that extends the NCS models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> to include both communication constraints as well as varying transmission delays and transmission intervals. In Section III we will transform this new NCS model into the hybrid system framework as introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> as this will facilitate further analysis. Also the stability and performance concepts as used in this paper are defined in this section. In Section IV we will derive the Lyapunov-based conditions that determine both the maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI) and the maximally allowable delay (MAD) guaranteeing global asymptotic stability and performance. We also present the results on semiglobal practical stability in this section. In Section V we show how the Lyapunov functions can be constructed on the basis of the widely adopted non-delay conditions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> and show that the non-delay case is a particular case of general framework. To demonstrate how the developed methods can be used for explicitly computing MATI and MAD guaranteeing stability or certain performance, we apply the framework to the benchmark problem of the batch reactor <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Finally, we state the conclusions and our ideas for future work.</p><p>The following notational conventions will be used in this paper. will denote all nonnegative integers, denotes all positive integers, denotes the field of all real numbers and denotes all nonnegative reals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. NCS MODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>In this section, we introduce the model that will be used to describe NCS including both communication constraints as well as varying transmission intervals and transmission delays. This model will form an extension of the NCS models used before in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> that were motivated by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. All these previous models did not include transmission delays. We consider the continuous-time plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> that is sampled. Here, denotes the state of the plant, denotes the most recent control values available at the plant, is a disturbance input and is the output of the plant. The controller<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where the variable is the state of the controller, is the most recent output measurement of the plant that is available at the controller and denotes the control input. The functions , are assumed to be continuous and and are assumed to be continuously differentiable. At times , , (parts of) the input at the controller and/or the output at the plant are sampled and sent over the network. The tranmission/sampling times satisfy and there exists a such that the transmission intervals satisfy for all , where denotes the maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI). At each transmission time , , the protocol determines which of the nodes is granted access to the network. Each node corresponds to a collection of sensors or actuators. The sensors/actuators corresponding to the node that is granted access collect their values of the entries in or that will be sent over the communication network. They will arrive after a transmission delay of time units at the controller or actuator. This results in updates of the corresponding entries in or at times , . The situation described above is illustrated for and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for the situation of two nodes that obtain access to the network in an alternating fashion.</p><p>It is assumed that there are bounds on the maximal delay in the sense that , , where is the maximally allowable delay (MAD). To be more precise, we adopt the following standing assumption.</p><p>Standing Assumption II.1: The transmission times satisfy , and the delays satisfy ,</p><p>, where is arbitrary.</p><p>The latter condition implies that each transmitted packet arrives before the next sample is taken. This assumption indicates that we are considering the so-called small delay case as opposed to the large delay case, where delays can be larger than the transmission interval. The inequalities and can be taken non-strict with the understanding that in case the update instant coincides with the next transmission instant , the update is performed before the next sample is taken. The updates at satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where denotes the vector with and . Hence, with . If the NCS has nodes, then the error vector can be partitioned as . The functions and are now update functions that are related to the protocol that determines on the basis of and the networked error which node is granted access to the network. Typically when the -th node gets access to the network at some transmission time we have that the corresponding part in the error vector has a jump at . In most situations, the jump will actually be to zero, since we assume that the quantization effects are negligible. For instance, when is sampled at time , then we have that . However, we allow for more freedom in the protocols by allowing general functions . See <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> for more details. We will refer to as the protocol. In between the updates of the values of and , the network is assumed to operate in a zero order hold (ZOH) fashion, meaning that the values of and remain constant in between the updating times and for all :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(6)</formula><p>To compute the resets of at the update times , we proceed as follows:</p><p>In the third equality we used that due to the zero order hold character of the network. We also implicitly employed our Standing Assumption II.1 as we used that there always occurs an update before the next sample is taken . A similar derivation holds for , leading to the following model for the NCS:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(7a) (7b)</formula><p>where with , , are appropriately defined functions depending on , , and and</p><p>. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> for the explicit expressions of and , which also reveal how we use the differentiability conditions on and imposed earlier. Standing Assumption II.2: and are continuous and is locally bounded.</p><p>Observe that the system ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)</p><p>is the closed-loop system (3) and (4) without the network (i.e., and in ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)). The problem that we consider in this paper is formulated as follows.</p><p>Problem II.3: Suppose that the controller (4) was designed for the plant (3) rendering the closed-loop (3) and (4) without the network, i.e., and , (or equivalently, ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)) stable in some sense. Determine the value of and so that the NCS given by ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is stable as well when the transmission intervals and delays satisfy Standing Assumption II.1</p><p>Remark II.4: Of course, there are certain extensions that can be made to the above setup. The inclusion of packet dropouts is relatively easy, if one models them as prolongations of the transmission interval. Indeed, if we assume that there is a bound on the maximum number of successive dropouts, the stability bounds derived below are still valid for the MATI given by , where is the obtained value for the dropout-free case. Another extension of the framework in this paper could be the inclusion of quantization effects. This step is more involved. It might be based on recent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> that unifies the areas of networked and quantized control systems without communication delays. It can be envisioned that the results presented here can be combined with the framework in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> leading to an overall methodology capable of handling all types of networked phenomena that were mentioned in the introduction. The specific conditions and types of quantizers for which this methodology is effective are subject of future research and some preliminary results are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Another possible extension of interest is the consideration of the large-delay case (in which the delays can be larger than the transmission interval). This would require a more involved NCS model that does not have the periodicity between transmission and update events as implied by Standing Assumption II.1. This is a hard problem, which will be considered in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. REFORMULATION IN A HYBRID SYSTEM FRAMEWORK</head><p>To facilitate the stability analysis, we transform the above NCS model into the hybrid system framework as developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This hybrid systems framework was also employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, where a similar model was obtained without the incorporation of delays. To do so, we introduce the auxiliary variables , , and to reformulate the model in terms of flow equations and reset equations. The variable is an auxiliary variable containing the memory in (7b) storing the value for the update of at the update instant , is a counter keeping track of the transmission, is a timer to constrain both the transmission interval as well as the transmission delay<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> and is a Boolean keeping track whether the next event is a transmission event or an update event. To be precise, when the next event will be related to transmission and when the next event will be an update. The Boolean will be used to guarantee in the model below that the transmission and update events are alternating in the sense that before a next sample is taking the previous update is implemented in the NCS.</p><p>The hybrid system is now given by the flow equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and the reset equations are obtained by combining the "transmission reset relations," active at the transmission instants , and the "update reset relations", active at the update instants , given by when <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> with the mapping given by the transmission resets (when ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and the update resets (when ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Two comments on this model are in order. First of all, the role of is to exclude (instantaneous Zeno) solutions to satisfying , and for or with , when . Also when similar solutions exist that are only resetting (sometimes called 'livelock' in hybrid systems theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>). However, can be taken arbitrarily small to still allow for small transmission intervals.</p><p>Secondly, the choice for when is irrelevant from a modeling point of view. However, it was selected here as , because it will simplify the analysis later. By taking the hybrid system above is in the form (1).</p><p>Definition III.1: For the hybrid system with , the set given by is said to be uniformly globally asymptotically stable (UGAS) if there exists a function such that, for each , and any initial condition , , , , , with <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>, all corresponding solutions satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> for all in the solution's domain. The set is uniformly globally exponentially stable (UGES) if can be taken of the form for some and . Remark III.2: The factor multiplying in the right-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is motivated by the fact that for small values of solutions of exist that have many resets without progressing too fast. Actually, the limit case has 'livelock' solutions that are only resetting (with remaining 0 and ) as discussed above. The scales the right-hand side of (13) for this effect.</p><p>We also introduce the concept of uniform semiglobal practical asymptotical stability.</p><p>Definition III.3: For the hybrid system with , the set is said to be uniformly semiglobally practically asymptotically stable (USPAS) with respect to and , if there exists such that for any pair of positive numbers there exist and such that for each , each initial condition , , , , , with , , , and each corresponding solution we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> for all in the solution's domain. In the presence of disturbance inputs in we might be interested in reducing its influence on a particular controlled output variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> in terms of the induced gain, as formally defined below. </p></div>

Stability Analysis</head><p>In order to guarantee UGAS or UGES, we assume the existence of a Lyapunov function for the reset equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) satisfying (17a) (17b) for all and all and the bounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> for all , and for some functions and and . In Section V we will show how a function satisfying ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) can be derived from the generally accepted conditions on the protocol as used for the delay-free case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>To solve Problem II.3, we extend <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>  </p><p>The inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) are similar in nature to the delayfree situation as studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and are directly related to the gain conditions from to as adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Although these conditions may seem difficult to obtain at first sight, this is not the case. We will demonstrate this in Section VI, where the complete computational set-up for determining the parameters in the above conditions is provided. See also Remark V.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and the conditions (23) transform into <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> and (25a) (25b)</p><p>We consider now the function <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> and show that this constitutes a suitable Lyapunov function for the system , which can be used to conclude UGAS and UGES under the stated conditions.</p><p>Below, with some abuse of notation, we consider the quantity with as in (9) even though is not differentiable with respect to and .

Hence, a continuum of Lyapunov functions is obtained by varying the initial conditions and . Moreover, each different choice of and provides different and . As a result, tradeoff curves between and can be obtained that indicate when stability of the NCS is still guaranteed.

For the delay-free case, one considers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> protocols satisfying the following condition: Condition V.1: The protocol given by is UGES (uniformly globally exponentially stable), meaning that there exists a function that is locally Lipschitz in its second argument such that (38a) (38b) for constants and .

In Lemma V.4 below, we specify appropriate values for these constants in case of the often used Round Robin (RR) and the Try-Once-Discard (TOD) protocols (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> for their definitions).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CASE STUDY OF THE BATCH REACTOR</head><p>In this section we will illustrate how the derived conditions can be verified and how this leads to quantitative tradeoff curves between , and performance for the case study of the batch reactor. This case study has developed over the years as a benchmark example in NCS, see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The functions in the NCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> for the batch reactor are given by the linear functions and . The batch reactor, which is open-loop unstable, has inputs, outputs, plant states and controller states and nodes (only the outputs are assumed to be sent over the network). See <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> for more details on this example. We included here also a disturbance input that takes values in and a controlled output , taking values in , given by . The numerical values for , , as provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>.

We selected for the remaining matrices , , and in this case study the numerical values as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>, shown at the bottom of the page.</p><p>This means that the disturbance is such that affects the first and third state of the reactor and, affects the second and fourth state. The controlled output is chosen to be equal to the measured output , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>(56) Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Stability Analysis</head><p>To apply the developed framework for stability analysis, we first ignore the controlled output and set . Moreover, we take and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. To verify <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> we take and consider a quadratic Lyapunov function to compute the gain from to (or actually a value close to the gain by selecting small) by minimizing subject to the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) (57a) (57b) Minimizing subject to the LMI (57) with using the SEDUMI solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> with the YALMIP interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> provides the minimal value of . This value of applies for both the TOD as well as the RR protocol in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> since and due to the proof of Lemma V.4. From Lemma V.4 also the values for the constants , , and can be obtained. Then Theorem V.3 can be applied to construct suitable Lyapunov functions for the closed-loop NCS system. This results for the TOD protocol in the values , , and . Note that and are the same as found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> for the delay-free case (up to some small numerical differences). In case we now take as , we recover exactly the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Indeed, checking the conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> gives and , as also found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Besides this delay-free limit case, the above numerical values provide much more combinations of that yield stability of the NCS by varying the initial conditions and . Actually, each pair of initial conditions provides a dif-Lyapunov function as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> and different values for as discussed after the proof of Theorem IV.2. To illustrate this, consider Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, which displays the solutions , , to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> for initial conditions and . The solutions , are determined using Matlab/Simulink [using zero crossing detections to determine the values of and accurately according to  ( <ref type="bibr">)</ref>]. The condition (23a) indicates that is determined by the intersection of and the constant line with value and condition (23b) states that is determined by the intersection of and (as long as ). For the specific situation depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> this would result in and , meaning that UGES is guaranteed for transmission intervals up to 0.008794 and transmission delays up to 0.005062. Interestingly, the initial conditions of both functions and can be used to make design tradeoffs. For instance, by taking larger, the allowable delays become larger (as the solid line indicated by 'o' shifts upwards), while the maximum transmission interval becomes smaller as the dashed line indicated by " " will shift upwards as well causing its intersection with (dotted line indicated by " ") to occur for a lower value of . Hence, once the hypotheses of Theorem IV.2 are satisfied, a continuum of Lyapunov functions is available leading to different combinations of MATI and MAD. This shows that tradeoff curves between and can indeed be constructed. Following this procedure for various increasing values of , while keeping equal to , provides the graph in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, where the particular point and corresponding to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> is highlighted. Note that the graph ends where as the developed model does not include delays larger than the transmission interval. Section VI-A if only stability is required (without any additional performance conditions, so the gain approaches infinity). The other extreme, when approaches infinity, recovers the situation where the values approach the asymptotic value of being the optimal network-free gain from to .</p><p>As we can see, a smaller gain requires a larger value of , which will in turn result in smaller values for and . We will demonstrate this for the TOD protocol. The results for the RR protocol can be obtained using the same approach. The computed values of are now used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref> and the values for the constants , , and can be obtained from Lemma V.4, as in the stability analysis above. Then Theorem V.3 can be applied to construct a continuum of suitable storage functions for the closed-loop NCS system choosing a certain combination of in a similar manner as for the stability analysis. This leads to combinations of such that the NCS has an gain from to smaller than for transmission intervals smaller than and communication delays smaller than . The tradeoff curves for various levels of the performance are provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. For the value of we (almost) recover the tradeoff plot as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> for the TOD protocol, because, loosely speaking, the gain requirement is very mild as is a relatively large value that practically approaches the condition that the NCS should be UGES only. In the other extreme, if very high requirements are given with respect to robustness to disturbances (in the sense of a very low gain from to approaching the network-free gain</p><p>), the values for MATI and MAD that guarantee this gain are approaching 0. This is clearly shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> as the tradeoff curve for the value corresponds to values of and close to zero. The limit case would actually correspond to and . Hence, the control and network engineers have to make clear design tradeoffs between MATI, MAD, robustness in terms of performance and the choice of the protocol. The provided framework supports the engineers to make these design choices in a quantified manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we presented a framework for studying the stability of a NCS, which involves communication constraints (only one node accessing the network per transmission), varying transmission intervals and varying transmission delays. Based on a newly developed model, a Lyapunov-based characterization of stability was provided and explicit bounds on the maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI) and the maximally allowable delay (MAD) were obtained that guarantee stability of the NCS. We explicitly showed how a continuum of Lyapunov functions can be constructed from the commonly adopted conditions for the delay-free case. The application of the results on a benchmark example showed how tradeoff curves between MATI and MAD can be computed providing designers of NCS with proper tools to support their design choices. Interestingly, recently developed improvements in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> leading to sharper bounds for the MATI (the non-delay case) are a special case of this more general framework. Additionally, we analyzed the performance of NCS and provided the theoretical framework that shows how MATI, MAD and can be traded quantitatively against each other. Under weaker conditions, we provided also semiglobal practical stability results.</p><p>Future work will involve the consideration of the large delay case (delays larger than the transmission interval) and the development of an analysis framework that also includes quantization effects. Extending the current framework so as to include quantization effects would provide the means to study NCS incorporating all the types of network phenomena mentioned in the introduction (as packet dropouts can be modeled using a prolongation of the MATI as discussed in Remark II.4). We foresee that such an extension would be extremely valuable to network and control system designers, provided that the extended framework leads to quantitative tradeoff curves between the various network parameters (MATI, MAD, quantization error, bandwidth, etc.) and the performance of the overall control loop. Some preliminary results in this direction can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Finally, to obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> observe that for the case , we have due to (44) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref> Similarly, for we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref> Take and multiply the inequalities ( <ref type="formula">53</ref>) and (54) by , which give for and for</p><p>Note that the bounds on as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> with linear bounding functions and can be easily obtained from the fact that satisfies (38a) with linear functions. This completes the proof.</p><p>To apply the above theorem for a given protocol we need to establish the values , , , and . The following lemma determines these constants for the well-known RR and TOD protocols. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> for the exact definitions of these protocols.</p><p>Lemma V.4: Let denote the number of nodes in the network. For the RR protocol there is a that is locally Lipschitz in its second argument satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> with , , , and . For the TOD protocol there is a that is locally Lipschitz in its second argument satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>, ( <ref type="formula">39</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">40</ref>) with , , and .</p><p>In case of the RR protocol we obtain the values , , and if we invoke Theorem V.3 directly. However, improved values for and can be obtained by exploiting the special structure in the matrix as was also done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ex. 3]</ref>. This is achieved by deriving directly the condition (19) instead of following the general approach based on (49)-( <ref type="formula">52</ref>) using ( <ref type="formula">40</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> in the proof of Theorem V.3. Indeed, using that for a diagonal matrix (with the values as in the proof of Lemma V.4 on the diagonal), we can derive directly for almost all and where we used that as both matrices are diagonal. Using this sharper result in ( <ref type="formula">49</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">52</ref>) instead of ( <ref type="formula">40</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">41</ref>), we obtain the improved values , , and , similar to [5] and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, which leads for the delay-free case to (recovering the result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which outperforms the values found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>). The tradeoff curve between MATI and MAD is also given in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. In this figure also the delay-free case with and is visualized. These tradeoff curves can be used to impose conditions or select a suitable network with certain communication delay and bandwidth requirements (note that MATI is inversely proportional to the bandwidth).</p><p>Also different protocols can be compared with respect to each other. In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, it is seen that for the task of stabilization of the unstable batch reactor the TOD protocol outperforms the RR protocol in the sense that it can allow for larger delays and larger transmission intervals. The difference between the tradeoff curves for different protocols is caused by different values for the parameters , , and (see Lemma V.4), which in turn induce different values for the parameters , , and (see Theorem V.3) and thus different solutions to the differential equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. This results in different combinations of and that guarantee stability due to Theorem IV.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Gain Analysis</head><p>To apply the developed framework for gain analysis, the effect of the additional disturbance input on the controlled variable is studied. We take and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. To verify <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref> we compute simultaneously an upper bound on the gain from to and on the gain from to by finding Pareto minimal values for and subject to the matrix inequalities in the matrix and multiplier as given in (58), shown at the bottom of the page. These matrix inequalities demonstrate that there will be a tradeoff between performance in terms of the gain from to reflected in on the one hand and the size of and on the other as reflected in . Recall that directly influences MATI and MAD through and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. The tradeoff between and can still be made by varying and whilst guaranteeing a certain gain for the NCS. To make these observations quantitative, we fix at various values and search for the smallest value of such that there exist and satisfying (58). Note that (58) is an LMI when is fixed and hence, can be solved efficiently. As a lower bound on we take the gain from to of the system without the network . This value is found by solving the standard -gain/ LMI for linear systems (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) using, again, the SEDUMI solver and the YALMIP interface. This yields . Using this as a lower bound on the considered values of the desirable performance level in terms of the gain , we search minimal values for (corresponding to the selected value of ) under the feasibility of the LMI (57). These minimal values yield the "Pareto optimal curves" for as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. This figure demonstrates that the minimal value of approaches 15.9165 for large values of , which was the gain from to as computed in Section VI-A for the stability analysis. This is expected as the value 15.9165 corresponds to the smallest value of found in (58) W. P. Maurice H.
