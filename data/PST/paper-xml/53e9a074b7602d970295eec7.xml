<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The advances in computing and communication technologies and software have resulted in an explosive growth in computing systems and applications that impact all aspects of our life. However, as the scale and complexity of these systems and applications grow, their development, configuration and management challenges are beginning to break current paradigms, overwhelm the capabilities of existing tools and methodologies, and rapidly render the systems and applications brittle, unmanageable and insecure.</p><p>This has led researchers to consider alternative approaches based on strategies used by biological systems to successfully deal with similar challenges of complexity, dynamism, heterogeneity and uncertainty. Autonomic computing is emerging as a significant new strategic and holistic approach to the design of complex distributed computer systems. It is inspired by the functioning of the human nervous system and is aimed at designing and building systems that are self-managing. More specifically, an autonomic system is a self-managing, autonomous and ubiquitous computing environment that completely hides its complexity, thus providing the user with an interface that exactly meets her/his needs. The system will always decide on its own, using high-level guidance from humans, what needs to be done to keep it stable. It will constantly check and optimize its status, and automatically adapt itself to changing conditions. Self-management is achieved through key aspects such as self-governing, self-adaptation, self-organization, selfoptimization, self-configuration, self-diagnosis of faults, self-protection, self-healing, self-recovery, and autonomy. Achieving these goals come down to bringing pre-emptive and proactive approaches to all areas of a computing system. Meeting these challenges of autonomic computing requires scientific and technological advances in a wide variety of fields, and new architectures that support effective integration of the constituent technologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Concepts</head><p>Biological systems have inspired systems design in many ways-Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Genetic Programming, and Holonic Systems to name a few. The most recent is the inspiration to create self-managing systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Autonomic nervous system</head><p>The human body's Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is the part of the nervous system that controls the vegetative functions of the body such as circulation of the blood, intestinal activity and secretion, and the production of chemical 'messengers', i.e. hormones, that circulate in the blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The system is subdivided into the sympathetic (SyNS) and parasympathetic (PaNS) nervous systems. These separate systems tend to have opposite effects, for example, parasympathetic slows the heart rate, whereas the sympathetic speeds it up. The sympathetic nervous activity increases in response to fear, i.e. the 'fight or flight' response, while the parasympathetic nervous activity acts to calm, i.e. the 'rest and digest' response, for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This biological self-management is influencing a new paradigm for computing that aims to create similar selfmanagement within systems (Autonomic Computing, Autonomic Communications and Autonomic Systems). For a discussion on the ANS in relation to Ashby's Ultrastable System <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Autonomic computing systems</head><p>IBM introduced the Autonomic Computing initiative in 2001, with the aim of developing self-managing systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. With the growth of the computer industry, notable examples being highly efficient networking hardware and powerful CPUs, autonomic computing is an evolution to cope with the rapidly growing complexity of integrating, managing, and operating computing system. Computing systems should be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, they should serve a useful purpose when they are first launched and continue to be useful as conditions change. The realization of autonomic computing will result in a significant improvement in system management efficiency. The disparate technologies that manage the environment work together to deliver the best performance results <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>As has been mentioned, the Autonomic Computing initiative is inspired by the human body's autonomic nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The autonomic nervous system monitors the heartbeat, checks blood sugar levels and maintains normal body temperature without any conscious effort from the human. There is an important distinction between autonomic activity in the human body and autonomic responses in computer systems. Many of the decisions made by autonomic elements in the body are involuntary, whereas autonomic elements in computer systems make decisions based on tasks which are chosen to be delegated to the technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Upon launching the Autonomic Computing initiative, IBM defined four general properties a system should have to constitute self-management: self-configuring, self-healing, self-optimising and self-protecting. These are accompanied by four enabling properties or attributes, namely selfawareness, environment-awareness, self-monitoring and self-adjusting <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Essentially, these objectives represent broad system requirements, while the attributes identify basic implementation mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Since the 2001 launch of Autonomic Computing, the self-* list of properties has grown substantially <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. It now also includes features such as self-anticipating, self-adapting, selfcritical, self-defining, self-destructing, self-diagnosis, self-governing, self-organized, self-recovery, self-reflecting, and self-simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Moreover, previous properties such as self-stabilizing were re-discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. Yet the initial set still represents the general goal.</p><p>To meet this autonomic selfware vision, systems should be designed with components that are allocated an autonomic manager.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> represents an Autonomic Element (AE) which consists of a managed component (MC) and an autonomic manager (AM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Control loops with sensors (selfmonitor) and effectors (self-adjuster) together with system knowledge and planning/adapting policies allow the autonomic element to be self-aware and to self-managethis is depicted as the local (L) control loop in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. A similar scheme, depicted as the global (G) control loop in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, facilitates environment awareness, allowing selfmanagement if necessary, but without the immediate control to change the environment-this is effected through communication with other autonomic managers that have the relevant influence through reflex or event messages as well as mobile agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In this scheme, every component in a system, and every system within systems of systems, is self-managing with management communications between autonomic managers.</p><p>The influence of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) may imply that the Autonomic Computing initiative is concerned only with low level self-managing capabilities such as reflex reactions. Yet the vision behind the initiative has as its overarching goal system-wide policy-based selfmanagement, where a human manager will state a businesscritical success factor and the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) systems will take care of realizing it, self-configuring and self-optimising to meet the policies, and self-protecting and self-healing to ensure the policies are maintained in light of changing context. It may be reasoned that due to our ANS we are freed (nonconscious activity) from the low-level complexity of managing our bodies, to perform high-level complex tasks. Similarly, for computing to develop further and provide equivalent high-level system-wide tasks, a corresponding low-level 'non-conscious' architecture is necessary. As such, growing this initiative will converge and cross-influence other emerging fields such as ubiquitous and pervasive computation and communications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Innovative self-managing components and interaction</head><p>The Autonomic Environment requires that autonomic elements and in particular autonomic managers communicate with one another concerning self-* activities. An additional component within the autonomic element is the pulse monitor, PBM (an extension of the embedded systems heart-beat monitor (HBM) that safe guards vital processes by emitting a regular 'I am alive' signal to another process), with the capability to encode health and urgency signals as a pulse <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, i.e. an 'I am healthy' signal. Together with standard event messages and mobile agents on the autonomic communications channel, this provides dynamics within autonomic responses and multiple loops of control, such as reflex reactions among the autonomic managers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">AI and autonomic components</head><p>The scope of AI and autonomic system is as wide as the AI research field itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Of particular interest from AI and other generic technologies for self-managing, autonomic and/or cooperative components are soft computing techniques (neural networks, fuzzy logic, probabilistic reasoning incorporating Bayesian networks and so on), machine learning techniques, cybernetics, optimization techniques, fault diagnosis techniques, feedback control, and planning techniques. Some examples of areas of research are discussed below.</p><p>Clockwork, a method for providing predictive selfmanagement, regulates behaviour in anticipation of need using statistical modelling, probabilistic reasoning, tracking and forecasting methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. It includes real-time model selection techniques to fulfil the self-configuration element of Autonomic Computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The use of probabilistic techniques, such as Bayesian networks (BNs) discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, are also central to research in autonomic algorithm selection. Systems use the BN approach along with self-training and self-optimization to find the best algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>In terms of root cause analysis within Autonomic Communications and Autonomic Networks, it has been highlighted that correlation, rule discovery and root cause analysis activity can benefit from incorporating Bayesian Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, either in the rule discovery process or in the actual model learning to assist with self-healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Large-scale server management and control has also received similar treatment. Event logs from a 250 node large-scale server were analyzed by applying a number of machine learning algorithms and AI techniques to establish time-series methods, rule-based classification and Bayesian network algorithms for a self-management and control system <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Another current aspect is the calculation of costs in an autonomic system and the self-healing equation. One approach utilizes naive Bayes for cost-sensitive classification and a feedback approach based on a Markov decision process for failure remediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The argument is easily made that the autonomic system involves decisions and decisions involve costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. This naturally leads to work with agents, incentives, costs and competition for resource allocation and extensions thereof <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</p><p>In effect, the breadth and scope of the autonomic vision is highlighted by such work that uses AI techniques (machine learning, Tabu search, statistical reasoning and clustering analysis) for controlling the detection of the need for reoptimization of enterprise business objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>An interesting paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, discusses affect and machine design <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Essentially it supports those psychologists and AI researchers that hold the view that affect (and emotion) is essential for intelligent behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. It proposes three levels for the design of systems: reaction, routine and reflection. Reaction is the lowest level where no learning occurs and only involves immediate response to state information coming from sensory systems. Routine is the middle level where largely routine evaluation and planning behaviours take place. It receives input from sensors as well as from the reaction and reflection level. Assessment at this level results in three dimensions of affect and emotion values: positive affect, negative affect and (energetic) arousal. Reflection is the top level, which receives no sensory input or has no motor output; it only receives input from below. Reflection is a meta-process, where the mind deliberates about itself. Essentially operations at this level look at the systems representations of its experiences, its current behaviour, its current environment, etc.</p><p>Essentially the reaction level sits within the engineering domain, monitoring current state of both the machine and its environment and rapidly reacting to changing circumstances. The reflection level may reside within the AI domain, utilizing its techniques to consider the behaviour of the system and learn new strategies. The routine level may be a cooperative mixture of both. Interestingly, this approach may be considered as a generic design for an autonomic architecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Autonomic architectures</head><p>Research in Autonomic Architectures consists of general architectures for individual components or complete autonomic computing systems, based on the integration of advanced technologies like Open Grid Computing, Web Services, (Multi-) Agent technologies, and/or intelligent/autonomous robotics.</p><p>The brief discussion in Section 2 concerning Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> highlights the general autonomic element architecture. This is similar to the IBM view <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref>] that represents the closed control loop within the autonomic element as consisting of four stages: 'MAPE'-monitor, analyze, plan and execute. The monitor and analyse parts of the structure process information from sensors to provide both self-awareness and an awareness of the external environment. The plan and execute parts decide on the necessary self-management behaviour that will be executed through the effectors. The MAPE components use correlations, rules, beliefs, expectations, histories and other information known to the autonomic element, or available to it through the knowledge repository within the autonomic manager (AM). White et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> are extending this architecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Autonomic interaction and policy based self-management</head><p>Autonomic Interaction and Policy Based Self-Management are technologies that support inter-element interactions, such as service-level agreements, negotiation protocols and algorithms, and conversation support. Research efforts based on the approach are discussed below.</p><p>The ABLE rule engine can be used for interaction and negotiation. In effect, it is an agent building learning environment that includes time series analysis and Bayes classification among others. It correlates events and invokes the necessary action policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Policy based management becomes particularly important with the future vision of Autonomic Computing, to facilitate high level specification of the goals and aims for the system to achieve <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. A policy-based management tool may reduce the complexity of product and system management by providing a uniform cross-product policy definition and management infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Computer-human interaction and Autonomic Systems</head><p>Computer-Human interaction with autonomic systems for engineering environments comprises user studies, interfaces for monitoring and controlling behaviour, and techniques for defining, distributing, and understanding policies. The issues involved in the area are highlighted in the paper 'Dealing with ghosts' <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and the concerns are being discussed through workshops <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Personal Autonomic Computing has a particular emphasis on CHI and Autonomicity since if you consider; autonomic computing makes choices for you while personal computing allows you to make choices yourself as such with PAC the human is still very much in the loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Science of autonomicity</head><p>Science of Autonomicity is the fundamental science of self-managing systems for engineering environments: understanding, controlling, or exploiting emergent behaviour, theoretical investigations of coupled feedback loops, robustness, and other related topics.</p><p>Autonomic has been expressed as the automation of systems adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Such work in the science of autonomicity is required for the area to mature and be used as a standard technique within engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Systems and software engineering for Autonomic Systems</head><p>There is a strong need for system and software engineering process models/methodologies for building autonomic systems. As expected, the focus during the early days of the new paradigm was on implementations/prototypes, architectures and tools to prove the concept. Increasingly, we are now seeing the 'Salmon effect', moving back up the waterfall from implementations to specific interest in how to program autonomic systems, how to design for self-management, and how to gather requirements specifically for an autonomic environment. Techniques are starting to be considered for requirements analysis and system design of autonomic systems, for instance Checkland's Soft Systems Methodology and Beer's Viable Systems Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, and relevance has been found in architectural approaches for describing an adaptive system <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Shaw et al.'s efforts on a process control approach to programming is considered particularly relevant to the AC initiative-not surprising since it was influenced by control loops <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>.</p><p>In terms of engineering of self-management into legacy systems, it involves providing an environment that monitors the sensors of the system and provides adjustment through effectors to create a control loop. One such systems engineering infrastructure is KX (Kinesthetics eXtreme), which runs a lightweight decentralized collection of active middleware components tied together via a publishsubscribe (content-based messaging) event system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Similarly, the Astrolabe tool may be used to automate selfconfiguration and monitoring, and to control adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>The AutoMate project, incorporating ACCORD, an autonomic component framework utilizes DIOS to provide mechanisms to directly enhance traditional computational objects/components with sensors, actuators, rules, a control network, management of distributed sensors and actuators, interrogation, monitoring and manipulation of components at runtime through a distributed rule-engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Examples of autonomic systems and applications</head><p>There have been a number of research efforts in both academia and industry to develop autonomic systems and applications. A sampling of these research systems are presented below.</p><p>Unity is an autonomic system that implements IBM's view of an autonomic architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</p><p>OceanStore <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, which is a global, consistent, highlyavailable persistent data storage system that supports self-healing, self-optimization, self-configuration, self-protection, policy based caching, routing substrate adaptation, autonomic replication, continuous monitoring, testing, and repair.</p><p>Storage Tank <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> is a multi-platform, universally accessible storage management system. It supports selfoptimization, self-healing, policy based storage and data management, server redirection and log-based recovery.</p><p>Oceano <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> facilitates cost effective scalable management of computing resources for software farms. In terms of autonomic behaviour, it handles self-optimization, selfawareness, autonomic demand distribution, and constant component monitoring.</p><p>AutoAdmin <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> sets out to reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) through self-tuning, self-administration by usage tracking, index tuning and recommendations based on workload.</p><p>Sabio <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> autonomically classifies large numbers of documents demonstrating self-* properties such as selforganization and self-awareness. It groups documents according to word and phrase usage.</p><p>Q-Fabric <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> provides system support for continuous online management through self-organization. It features continuous online quality management through 'customizability' of each application's Quality of Service (QoS).</p><p>Applications of autonomic computing in engineering applications, such as autonomic (urban) traffic systems, autonomic industrial/residential building systems, autonomic industrial process systems, or autonomic manufacturing systems will increasingly come to the fore. As would be expected, early adaptors have come from within computing, for instance, efforts to add autonomic capabilities to instant messaging, spam detection, load balancing and middleware have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Database systems in particular, have been an early success within the AC initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> due to the evolution of the DBMS towards more complex features and a resulting move towards self-tuning. SMART DB2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> provides for the reduction of human intervention and cost for DB2 through such self-management systems as self-optimization, self-configuration, autonomic index determination, disaster recovery, continuous monitoring of DB2's health and alerting the DBA.</p><p>An example of a ubiquitous computing application, Smart Doorplates, seeks to assist visitors to a building in locating an individual who is presently not in his/her office. A module in the architecture utilizes probabilistic reasoning to predict the next location of the individual, which is reported along with their current location <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</p><p>Early versions of tools or autonomic functionality updates to existing tools and software suites in this area have recently been released by IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> through their AlphaWorks Autonomic Zone website <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The generic Log and Trace Tool correlates event logs from legacy systems to identify patterns. These can be used to facilitate automation or help debugging <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The Tivoli Autonomic Monitoring Engine essentially provides server level correlation of multiple IT systems to assist with root cause analysis and automated corrective action <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Increasing constraints on resources, and greater focus on the cost of operations, has led NASA and others to utilize adaptive operations and move towards almost total onboard autonomy in certain classes of mission operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Autonomy provides self-governance, giving responsibility to the agents within the system to meet their defined goals. Autonomic Systems provides self-management, in addition to self-governance, to meets one's own functional goals. There is also a shared responsibility to ensure the effective management (through self-* properties) of the system, which may include responsibilities beyond the normal task oriented goals of an individual agent, for instance, to monitor another agents health signs (ensuring self-protection, self-healing and possibly initiate self-configuration and/or self-optimization activities). As such, Autonomic Computing has been identified by NASA as a key area <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and research is underway to utilize it in addition to autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
