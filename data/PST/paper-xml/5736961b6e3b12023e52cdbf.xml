<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recursive Tracking of Vascular Networks in Angiograms Based on the Detection-Deletion Scheme</head><p>Iching Liu and Ying Sun Abstract-A computer algorithm was developed for automated identification of 2-D vascular networks in X-ray angiograms. This was accomplished by using an adaptive tracking algorithm in a three-stage recursive procedure. First, given a starting position and direction, a segment in the vascular network was identified. Second, by filling it with the surrounding background pixel values, the detected segment was deleted from the angiogram. The detection-deletion scheme was employed to prevent the problem of tracking-path reentry in those areas where vessels overlap. Third, all branch points were detected by use of matched filtering along both edges of the vessel. The detected branch points were used as the starting points in the next recursion. The recursive procedure terminated when no new branch point was found. The algorithm showed a good performance when it was applied to angiograms of coronary and radial arteries. To provide a quantitative evaluation, vascular networks identified by the algorithm were compared to those identified by human. The algorithm made some false-negative errors, but very few falsepositive errors. The true detection rate for vascular pixels was between 81 and 97% for angiograms with digital subtraction (n = 3) and without subtraction (n = 8), and 75% in a worst case study using low-quality cineangiograms (n = 3). The computational time was on average 3 s on a workstation. The algorithm should be useful for automated detection and quantitative analysis of blood vessel images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>ITH the rapid growth of digital angiography, several computer algorithms have been recently reported to provide either semi-automated or automated delineation of blood vessel segments in angiograms [1]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This type of vessel tracking algorithm can reduce or eliminate the interobserver variability and the intraobserver variability in making measurements such as the percent diameter stenosis of a coronary artery. In this study, attention is shifted to the identification of the entire vascular network. We propose a fully automated algorithm that identifies and provides a two-dimensional, structural description of the entire vascular network based on a single-view angiogram.</p><p>The study is motivated by the following. First, the percent diameter stenosis alone is not a reliable index for determining the severity of the stenosis. The hemodynamic resistance of a coronary artery stenosis also depends upon the shape of the cross sections of the vessel lumen and the length of the  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. More importantly, it is the degree of flow reduction in the myocardium that determines the severity of the stenosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A computer algorithm for identifying the vascular network is a step closer to the extraction of the hemodynamic information through sequential frames of angiograms. Second, the coronary artery stenosis is often eccentric. The assessment of stenosis dimensions based on a single-view angiogram is prompt to error. To reconstruct 3-D vascular structures, our previous study [8] has shown that vascular networks provide crucial information for resolving the problem of segment correspondence between biplane angiograms. Third, the coronary artery network provides a natural marker for the epicardial surface. Thus, the proposed algorithm will assist us in studying motions of the epicardium using time sequences of coronary arteriograms.</p><p>Very few algorithms have been previously reported to delineate the entire vascular network <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, [ 101. Our algorithm is different from those algorithms in both objective and approach. First, the output of our algorithm contains not only the identification of the .vessel pixels in the image, but also a structural description of the vascular network. In other words, the tracking algorithm not only separates artery pixels from background, but also extracts the semantic information about how segments are linked together. On the segment level, the structural description contains the center line, the lumen width, and direction for every point on the center line. On the network level, the connectivity of the vessel segments is depicted by a directed graph. Second, most parameters in the algorithm are adaptive to the vascular geometry. An objective in the algorithm design is to limit the number of empirical parameters. Occasionally, the use of an empirical parameter is difficult to avoid. In such a case, the effect and sensitivity of adjusting the parameter must be quantitatively characterized. Third, our algorithm does not rely on the a priori assumption of the vascular anatomy. Thus, the algorithm should be applicable to a variety of vasculature as well as imaging modalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">COMPUTER ALGORITHM</head><p>Our approach to the network identification is based on recursive tracking. A major vessel segment and all branch points along it are first identified. Then, the same tracking process repeats for every detected branch point. To prevent the problem of tracking a vessel segment that has already been tracked, a detection-deletion scheme is used [ 1 11. At each step 00278-0062/93$03.00 0 1993 IEEE of the recursion, the detected vessel segment is deleted from the angiogram. There are three stages at each recursion: 1) detection of a single vessel segment, 2) deletion of the detected vessel, and 3) detection of branch points. The recursive process terminates when there is no new side branch detected. The result of this recursion is a breadth-first search <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> whereby the entire vascular tree is identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Detection of a Single-Vessel Segment</head><p>The single-vessel tracking algorithm is based on the "extrapolation-update'' scheme reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Given a starting point and initial search direction, the tracking procedure sequentially detects the incremental sections along a vessel segment. In the extrapolation part, the tracking path is extended beyond the present position, along the current vessel direction, and at a distance away. This distance is called the look-ahead distance Nahead. In the update part, the tracking path is guided by a one-dimensional matched filter, which is applied to a scan line perpendicular to the current vessel direction within a window which is Wmain pixels wide. The expected pattern for the vessel cross-sectional intensity profile is a rectangle whose width is adapted to the current vessel lumen width. The tracking process terminates when the signalto-background ratio of the cross-sectional density profile is less than a threshold TSBR.</p><p>A tracked segment is identified as part of the vascular structure if its length is greater than the minimum length threshold T M L .</p><p>TML is set to reduce the occurrence of falsepositive errors caused by the spurious tracking of random noise or irrelevant anatomical structures. A moving-average lowpass filter with equal weights is used to smooth the data of position, direction, and lumen width along the detected center line. The order of the filter is set to be 3 based on a previous study of the spatial frequency characteristics of the vascular geometry [13]. The output of the tracking process is a segment description given by</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Deletion of the Detected Segment</head><p>The vessel segment, once identified, is erased from the image. The deletion process is based on the rationale that the vessel segment already identified should not interfere with the subsequent process of tracking.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Detection of Branch Points</head><p>After the deletion of a vessel segment, the branch points are detected by searching for branches along both sides of the vessel. To illustrate how the algorithm works, an example of branch-point detection with real data is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The average gray-scale value for pixels along the left edge is determined according to where G ( . ) denotes the gray-scale value for the pixel at the given position.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notice that p z [ i , O] is the same as pi[i]. A branch point is detected for the ith center line point if the following inequality holds:</head><p>where Nwidth is an empirical parameter related to the tradeoff between sensitivity and robustness of the branch-point detection. The branch-point detection is applied for every point on the center line, and independently along the left edge and the right edge.</p><p>For each detected branch point, a matched filter is used to identify the starting position and direction of the side branch. The pattern M [ i , k] in the matched filter is triangular in shape:</p><p>Notice that the base of this triangular profile is adapted to the lumen width W[i]. The matched filter is applied to the scan line parallel to the current vessel direction. The output of the matched filter O[i,k] is given by the convolution between the triangular pattern defined above and the gray-scale profile of the scan line defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>:</p><p>The window Wside on the scan line to which the matched filter is applied is twice the current vessel lumen width W The direction that the side branch launches off is given by where 11 11 denotes the norm of a vector. It is worth noting the reason for choosing a triangular profile as the matched pattern. The size of the side branch varies and is usually less than the size of the main branch. The triangular profile provides a sensitive response, and results in a reasonable computational effort in the convolution. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a), an example of branch detection illustrates the difference in the matched filter's response between a rectangular pattern and a triangular pattern. The actual gray-scale profile along the scan line is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b)</ref>. Notice that the unprocessed profile is multimodal. Although the peak roughly corresponds to the center point of the vessel in this example, it is not always the case. Thus, we use a matched filter to give a more reliable estimate of the center line point. The rectangular profile is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c</ref>), with the corresponding output of the matched filter shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(d)</ref>. The triangular profile is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(e)</ref>, with the corresponding output of the matched filter shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(Q.</ref> In both cases, the output of the matched filter is unimodal. With the triangular pattern, however, the output shows a more distinct peak, and generally results in a better estimate of the starting position for the side branch.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">[i]. Let O[i,k,,,]</formula><p>The branch-point detection proceeds sequentially for every point of the center line. Once a branch point has been identified, a refractory interval is set to prevent multiple detections on the same branch. The current point of search is advanced by a distance of Nskip pixels along the vessel center line. In other words, within any interval of Nskip pixels along the same side of a vessel, it is not possible to detect more than one branch. However, it is possible to find one branch launching from the left and another launching from the right at the same center line point because the branch search is performed independently along each side of the vessel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</head><p>The algorithm was applied to three types of angiograms. They were, in the order of increasing image quality: 1) digitized cineangiogram (DCA), 2) direct video angiogram (DVA), and 3) digital subtraction angiogram (DSA). All images were originally digitized with a resolution of 512 x 512 x 8 b; however, in this paper, only a 256 x 256 portion containing the vascular network is shown for better visualization. The DCA images were obtained by digitizing the light projection from the cineangiographic film via a video camera. Because of the complex imaging chain, the DCA images contained the highest noise level of all. The DVA images were obtained via a video camera focused directly on the X-ray image intensifier during the catheterization procedure. The DSA images were each obtained by subtracting two DVA's before and after the injection of the X-ray contrast agent. When the subtraction process was free from motion artifacts, the DSA images showed the highest signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>In addition to a qualitative evaluation, a quantitative evaluation was made by comparing vascular networks identified by the algorithm with those identified by a human operator. Two types of detection error are considered, i.e., false negatives and false positives. A false negative is a missed detection which usually occurs with the presence of a low-contrast vessel or overlapping vessels. A false positive is a spurious detection which is usually caused by random noise, artifacts from digital subtraction, or irrelevant anatomical structures. In the manual identification process, an effort was made to eliminate the human operator's subjectivity as much as possible. The angiogram was first binarized by thresholding. The selection of the gray-scale threshold was done manually to include all major visible vessels with some false positives, but no false negative. Next, an image editor was used to delete pixels caused by noise or other types of interference. The number of pixels deleted from the 512 x 512 images was 0.1-0.2% for DSA's and I-2% for DCA's and DVA's. The resulting binary pattern was regarded as the "true" vascular network in the evaluation.</p><p>By comparing the computer-identified network with the human-identified network, the false-negative and false-positive pixels are determined. Because the vessel detection method is different in the automated approach and the manual approach, a certain degree of discrepancy exists near the edges of a truepositive vessel segment. In general, the vessel lumen width detected by the (automated) tracking algorithm is slightly larger than that detected by the (manual) thresholding method. Because the present attention is focused on the network structure not on the lumen width, the discrepancy for a truepositive vessel is not included in the analysis. In other words, we consider that a detection error occurs only when the discrepancy pertains to a complete section of vessel. The true detection rate (TDR) and false detection rate (FDR) are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T D R = 1 - ( FDR = -AFP x loo(%) (14)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Avessel</head><p>where Avessel is the area (in pixels) occupied by the true network pattern; AFN and AFP are, respectively, the area occupied by the false-negative pixels and the area occupied by the false-positive pixels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head><p>The recursive tracking algorithm was coded in the C language on a Sun 41490 computer (Sun Microsystem, San Jose, CA). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, an example is given to illustrate how the detectiondeletion scheme works. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(a) shows a DSA of the radial artery of the human right hand. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4(b)</ref>, the first vessel segment identified by the tracking algorithm is shown. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(c), the detected segment is deleted from the angiogram. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4(d)</ref> shows the vascular network identified by the human operator. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(e) shows the vascular network identified by the algorithm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(f) shows the false-negative pixels in black and the false-positive pixels in white. For this comparison, TDR was 90% and FDR was 2%; the computational time for tracking the entire vascular network was 3 CPU s. The recursive tracking began with a userspecified root node which defined the starting position and search direction. It was observed that occasionally the tracking result was influenced by the starting position. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, two slightly different results were obtained by using different starting positions. This effect was further studied quantitatively, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. When the starting position was changed in a neighborhood of 5 x 5 pixels, the performance, as measured by TDRFDR, varied between 9612 and 7010%. The worse case resulted from the missed detection of a branch.</p><p>To evaluate further the performance over a broad range of image quality, the algorithm was applied to coronary arteriograms (three DSA images, eight DVA images, and three DCA images). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, two typical results (top and bottom) of vascular network identification for the DSA images are shown. For each image on the left, the skeletal structure of the humanidentified network is superposed on the original image. The corresponding tracking result is shown on the right, with the center lines in white and the lumen scan lines in black. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, two typical results for the DVA images are shown in the same format, and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, two typical results for the DCA images are shown. The computational time obviously depended on the complexity of the vascular network. The computational time was 2.8 s on average, ranging from 2.1 to 3.9 s.</p><p>There is a total of seven empirical parameters in the algorithm. A systematic analysis was performed to identify the The discrepancy between the computer-identified and the human-identified network is shown in black for false negative and white for false positive.</p><p>appropriate values for these parameters and to determine the sensitivity of the algorithm's performance with respect to each parameter. We found that five of the seven parameters were insensitive to the image quality. A satisfactory performance over a broad range of image quality was achieved by keeping the parameter values constant. These parameters and their values are summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. Two other parameters, Nahead and T ~I L , were set differently for DSA, DVA, and DCA, as shown in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>. The sensitivity analysis for these two parameters is given below.</p><p>Qualitatively, the tracking performance was acceptable because all major vessel segments were correctly identified by the algorithm; the detection errors, when they occurred, pertained to the smaller side branches. Quantitatively, the algorithm's performance was evaluated by use of TDRRDR for the three different sets of images. The performance is shown for different lookahead distances in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">111</ref> and for different minimum length thresholds in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>. By using the appropriate Nahead and Thf~ as listed in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>, TDR varied between 97 and 81% for the DSA and DVA images. TDR dropped to 75% for the DCA images because of the low image quality. The false positives, on the other hand, seldom occurred. FDR was zero except in two cases, i.e., DSA 1 and DCA 2 (indicated by the arrow in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, respectively). In the case of DSA 1, a subtraction artifact from the edge of a rib bone was incorrectly identified as a vessel segment. The area occupied by the false-positive pixels was 7% of the total vascular area. In the case of DCA 2, a vessel segment was surrounded by a high-intensity background as a result of the perfusion of the X-ray contrast agent into the myocardium. The tracking path deviated from the actual vessel segment for a small section, and showed a false positive as well as a false negative. The area occupied by the false-positive pixels was 9% of the total vascular area.</p><p>V. DISCUSSION In summary, an algorithm for automated identification of vascular networks in angiograms was developed. The algorithm was based upon a recursive tracking procedure. Matched filters were used to guide the tracking of a single vessel and the  detection of side branches. A detection4eletion scheme was developed to prevent the problem of tracking-path reentry. The study showed that the algorithm worked not only for digital subtraction angiograms, but also for direct video angiograms  and digitized cineangiograms of low image quality. The type of error in the tracking results was predominantly false negatives, which occurred at small side branches and low-contrast vessels. False positives were occasionally observed as a result of structured noise such as the high background contrast and the digital subtraction artifact, but were never observed as a result of random noise such as the quantum mottle. The performance was, in general, very robust. The computational time was typically around 3 s. Thus, the goal of developing an efficient and reliable algorithm for tracking the vascular network in angiograms was successfully achieved.</p><p>This algorithm generates a useful structural description of the vascular network. As the tracking algorithm proceeds, the vessel pixels are detected and organized into a center line and lumen-width scan lines perpendicular to the vessel direction.  Furthermore, the breadth-first search over the vascular tree results in a directed-graph representation of the connectivity of vessel segments. Unquestionably, the structural description of the 2-D vascular network does not always reflect the actual structure of the 3-D vascular tree. In particular, it is difficult to determine the connectivity from a single-view angiogram when vessel segments overlap. The ambiguity caused by overlapping vessels can be resolved by using biplane angiograms taken from two different directions. Such an analysis involves the matching of vessels between two views. In this case, the 2-D structural description is very helpful because it allows information to be processed at the level of vessel segments instead of the level of vessel pixels.</p><p>A common problem associated with detection algorithms is the use of empirical parameters. We use the word "empirical" to separate this class of parameters from those obtained with a more theoretical basis and independent of the data. The values of the empirical parameters are usually determined by experiments or on an ad hoc basis. For an algorithm that shows the level of complexity in this study, it is difficult to measure statistics and to mathematically characterize every detail that affects the algorithm's behavior. Thus, the use of empirical parameters is unavoidable. However, extensive use of such parameters often gives away the generality of the algorithm. In this study, we have made a deliberate effort to control this problem based on the following rules. First, the use of empirical parameters should be avoided whenever possible. Second, if an empirical parameter must be used, the value of the empirical parameter should be made adaptive to the data whenever possible. Third, an analysis must be made for every empirical parameter regarding the effect of adjusting the parameter's value on the algorithm's performance. This sensitivity analysis has been ignored by many investigators.</p><p>A total of seven empirical parameters was used in the recursive tracking algorithm. Among them, only two required adjustment to accommodate different image quality. The tracking look-ahead distance Nahead controlled the sensitivity of the tracking process with respect to the vessel direction. It was adapted to the vessel lumen width W . In the case of DSA's, Nahead was set to 1 W ; the shorter look-ahead distance allowed the tracking path to follow the vessel direction more closely. In the case of DCA's and DVA's, Nahead was set to 2W; the longer lookahead distance made the tracking process more robust under the low-contrast situations. The threshold for minimum vessel length TML was used to reject spurious tracking caused by either random or structured noise. A side branch was accepted only when the length of its center line was longer than TML. TML was set at 10, 20, and 50 pixels for DSA, DVA, and DCA, respectively. The highest value was set for the DCA images due to the high noise level.</p><p>The user-specified root node was an additional variable in the identification of the vascular network. The procedure was designed such that, for an angiogram of complex vascular structures, the user may specify an appropriate root node to extract only the portion of the vascular network of interest. The tracking result was insensitive to the initial search direction, but sensitive to the starting position to a certain degree, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. This phenomenon can be related to the use of the lookahead distance, which sets the interval between points where the tracking path was guided. The positions of these points relative to the vascular network are altered when a different starting position is given. As a consequence, the tracking path and the order of finding each segment are often affected. A possible solution to eliminating this variability is to initiate multiple tracking processes, each starting with a slightly different position. The final result is given by the union of all the vascular networks identified.</p><p>Considering the complexity of the structural description that the algorithm provides, the computational time of 3 s suggests that the algorithm is relatively efficient. The following contributes to the computational efficiency. First, the tracking process follows the vascular network; only pixels at and near the vessels are examined. Second, the detection4eletion scheme prevents tracking repetitively over the same vessel segment; a segment, once identified, is removed from the image. Third, the recursive tracking results in a one-path search over the vascular network; the structural description accumulates as the tracking proceeds.</p><p>The aforementioned approach based on recursive tracking also contributes to the low error rate for false positives. In the breadth-first search, the detection of vessel segments grows from the root node. Interferences from irrelevant structures or high background contrast are likely to cause false positives; however, such areas in the image would not even be looked at by the algorithm as long as they are not in the way of the tracking path. As shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I11</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>, the error is dominated by false negatives. For our purposes, this is a desirable receiver operating characteristic. A false negative often occurs at a small side branch, which is of less significance for two reasons: First, the presence of stenosis in a small coronary artery branch is clinically of less concern than one in a major coronary artery. Second, our main purpose for developing this algorithm is the generation of 2-D vascular networks which can be used in 3-D reconstruction of vascular trees from two biplane angiograms <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Our study has shown that the major vessel segments provide sufficient information to resolve the ambiguities in the two-view reconstruction problem. Furthermore, a spurious detection causes more problems in the matching of segments between the two views than a missed detection does.</p><p>This study has demonstrated an effective algorithm that identifies vascular networks by recursively performing the tracking of a single vessel, the deletion of the detected vessels, and the detection of branch points. Although the evaluation was done mainly with the X-ray angiograms of the coronary artery, the algorithm may be applicable to other vascular networks such as the cerebral vessels and to other image modalities such as the retinal images. Future direction of the research lies in the extension from 2-D to 3-D, with the objective to identify 3-D vascular structures from two or a limited number of views.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>- 11 .</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Fig. I .
