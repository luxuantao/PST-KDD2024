<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fuzzy c-means (FCM) has been considered as an effective algorithm for image segmentation. However, it still suffers from two problems: one is insufficient robustness to image noise, and the other is the Euclidean distance in FCM, which is sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose two new algorithms, generalized FCM (GFCM) and hierarchical FCM (HFCM), to solve these two problems. Traditional FCM can be considered as a linear combination of membership and distance from the expression of its mathematical formula. GFCM is generated by applying generalized mean on these two items. We impose generalized mean on membership to incorporate local spatial information and cluster information, and on distance function to incorporate local spatial information and image intensity value. Thus, our GFCM is more robust to image noise with the spatial constraints: the generalized mean. To solve the second problem caused by Euclidean distance (l2 norm), we introduce a more flexibility function which considers the distance function itself as a sub-FCM. Furthermore, the sub-FCM distance function in HFCM is general and flexible enough to deal with non-Euclidean data. Finally, we combine these two algorithms to introduce a new generalized hierarchical FCM (GHFCM). Experimental results demonstrate the improved robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Image segmentation is one of the most important and difficult problems in many applications, such as robot vision, object recognition and medical image processing. Although different methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have been proposed for image segmentation, it remains a challenge due to overlapping intensities, low contrast of images, and noise perturbation. In the last decades, fuzzy segmentation methodologies, and especially the fuzzy c-means algorithms (FCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, have been widely studied and successfully applied in image clustering and segmentation. Their fuzzy nature makes the clustering gmail.com. procedure able to retain more original image information than the crisp or hard clustering methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</p><p>Although the FCM algorithm usually performs well with non-noise images, it is still weak in imaging noise, outliers and other imaging artifacts. This may be caused by two aspects: one is the usage of the non-robust, Euclidean distance function which is not robust under noise perturbations, and the other does not pertain to any information about spatial context. Thus, two following questions are presented:</p><p>(1) How to choose the proper distance function to make the standard FCM more robust to image noise and outliers? (2) How to adopt the local spatial information to make the standard FCM more robust to image noise?</p><p>Several attempts have been made to compensate for these drawbacks of FCM. For example, in <ref type="bibr">[8-11, 27, 28]</ref>, various more robust alternatives for the distance function of the FCM algorithm have been proposed. Some researchers suggested replacing the Euclidean distance (l 2 ) with the city block distance (l 1 ) in FCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Bobrowski et al. used l 1 and l ∞ norm instead of Euclidean distance l 2 in FCM. A more general study using l p norm distances can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The modified distance and kernel distance function were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, respectively.</p><p>To overcome the second shortcoming, a wide variety of approaches have been proposed to incorporate spatial information in the image <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A common approach is the use of a Markov Random Field (MRF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Such method aims to impose spatial smoothness constraints on the image pixel labels. Recently, a special case of the MRF model-the Hidden MRF (HMRF) Model-has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we propose two simple and effective algorithms, generalized FCM (GFCM) and hierarchical FCM (HFCM), to overcome these two limitations.</p><p>The idea of HFCM is inspired by the hierarchical mixture of experts (HME) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. An additional feature of the hierarchical mixture classifier is that it provides class conditional density estimates as flat mixtures. In our HFCM, we assume the distance function is estimated by a sub-FCM in order to allow a more general setting. In standard FCM, this distance function is represented by Euclidean distance, l 2 norm. However, in our algorithm, each distance function is represented by a sub-FCM of two or three sub-components, which allows us to approximate non-Euclidean distance functions (such as gamma or logarithmic gamma distance for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image processing). Moreover, the idea of HFCM can be extended to various distance functions, such as l p norm and kernel distance functions, etc. Thus, our algorithm is more flexible and general than standard FCM.</p><p>We incorporate generalized mean into FCM, called GFCM, to overcome the second shortcoming mentioned above. In fact, FCM can be considered as a linear combination of membership and distance function from the expression of its mathematical formula. We impose generalized mean on this two items to make the labeling of a pixel influenced by the labels in its immediate neighborhood. We impose general-ized mean on membership to combine local spatial information and component information, and on distance function to combine local spatial information and observation information. We then combine our two proposed algorithms (GFCM and HFCM) and introduce Generalized Hierarchical Fuzzy C-Means (GHFCM). The performance of proposed approach, compared with state-of-the-art technologies, demonstrates its improved robustness and effectiveness.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide a brief review of the generalized mean and the FCM algorithm. In Section 3, we introduce our GFCM algorithm which adopts generalized means as the spatial constraints. We introduce our HFCM which represents each distance function in standard FCM by a single sub-FCM in Section 4 and GHFCM in Section 5. The experimental results are given in Section 6. Finally, some concluding remarks are provided.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Model establishment</head><p>Let us first consider (4). It can be easily seen that the objective function is composed of two items: membership u ij and distance function d ij . Our algorithm is simple, easy and straightforward to modify these two items with local generalized mean. This modification incorporates more local spatial information to make the model more robust to image noise. After modification of (1), the local generalized mean is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">M p = ⎛ ⎝ 1 N i c∈N i a c ⎞ ⎠ 1/p . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where N i is the neighborhood of the i-th pixel, including the i-th pixel. Considering weighted factor and local generalized arithmetic mean with distance measure, a new objective function can be given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">J m = N i=1 J j=1 u m ij c∈N i w c d cj . (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where w c is the weighted factor to control the influence of the neighborhood pixels depending on their distance from the central pixel i. Generally, the strength of w c should decrease as the distance between pixel c and i increases. One possible selection of w c is the Gaussian function: 2 , where d ci , is the spatial Euclidean distance between pixels c and i, and δ = (window size -1)/4. By applying the optimization way similar to the standard FCM, the parameters in GFCM can be calculated iteratively as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">w c = 1/ 2πδ 2 1/2 exp -d 2 ci /2δ</formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">µ j = N i=1 c∈N i w c u m ij y c N i=1 c∈N i w c u m ij . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">u ij = ⎛ ⎝ c∈N i w c d cj ⎞ ⎠ 1/(1-m) J h=1 ⎛ ⎝ c∈N i w c d ch ⎞ ⎠ 1/(1-m)</formula><p>.</p><p>(11) The membership function u ij in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> represents the probability that an image pixel i belongs to the j-th cluster. However, it can be seen that the spatial information of the membership function in the neighborhood of each pixel is not under consideration in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. By applying local weighted generalized mean on membership, the modified membership u ij can be re-calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">u ij = c∈N i w c u cj J h=1 c∈N i w c u ch . (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>where w c is the weighted factor defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The "old" membership u ij (on the right side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">12</ref>)) is calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. We then use "new" membership (on the left side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">12</ref>)) instead of "old" membership in our proposed fuzzy system. It is noted that "new" membership incorporates more image spatial information according to the help of local weighted generalized mean. Thus, our algorithm is more robust to image noise.</p><p>For a deep understanding of our algorithm, let us give some analysis for usage of generalized mean in detail. Distance function d ij is a measure between point y i and cluster center µ j in standard FCM. In our GFCM, this distance is influenced by the distance in its immediate neighborhood to incorporate local spatial information and observation information (image intensity value). The new distance function in our model can be modified as (ignoring constant item)</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">d ij = c∈N i w c y c -µ j 2 = ȳi -µ j 2 . (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">13</ref>) may explain why our method is more robust to image noise. Assuming image intensity y i is corrupted by image noise, in this case, calculation of d ij in standard FCM may be far away from the "true" distance function. However, in our model, this distance is calculated by modified ȳi which is obtained by its immediate neighborhood.</p><p>The membership function u ij represents the probability that image pixel i belongs to the cluster j. Similar to distance function, we also use generalized mean to make the membership of image pixel i influenced by the membership in its immediate neighborhood for incorporating local spatial information and cluster information, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. That means the probability of i-th pixel belongs to the cluster j is not decided by the pixel i (u ij ), but by the neighborhood of pixel i</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">( c∈N i w c u cj ).</formula><p>In short, our algorithm is based on an obvious fact. A single image pixel i is easy to be corrupted by noise. However, image pixels in the local neighborhood of ith pixel are hard to be all corrupted by noise. As long as the "signal" pixels are more than "noise" pixels in this neighborhood, the correct function (membership or distance function) can always be calculated. This is the reason why we use the generalized mean to calculate "average" functions for eliminating the noise effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Connection to existing methods</head><p>In this subsection, we discuss the relationship and difference between our algorithm and existing methods as follows:</p><p>(1) Compared to Ahmed's method Ahmed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposed modified FCM (MFCM) where the objective function of the classical FCM is modified in order to compensate the intensity inhomogeneity and allow the labeling of a pixel to be influenced by the labels in its immediate neighborhood. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the objective function is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">J m = N i=1 J j=1 u m ij ⎛ ⎝ d y i , µ j + a N R c∈N i d y c , µ j ⎞ ⎠ . (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">)</formula><p>where N i is the neighborhood of the i-th pixel including the i-th pixel itself, and N R represents its cardinality. The parameter a is used to control the effect of the neighbor's term.</p><p>Compared ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">9</ref>) with ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">14</ref>), it can be easily seen that Ahmed's method is a special case of our algorithm when we set</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">w c = 1, c= i a N R , c ∈ N i and c / = i (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>In other words, our algorithm degrades to the Ahmed's method under condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Furthermore, Ahmed's method only considers the neighborhood's effect on distance function but not on the membership function. In fact, one important image characteristic is that neighboring pixels are highly correlated. These neighboring pixels possess similar membership, and the probability that they belong to the same cluster is great <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>(2) Compared to Global generalized FCM Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposed a general FCM model which combines (weighted) generalized mean and FCM. The (weighted) generalized mean defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">M f (Y ) = f ⎛ ⎝ J j=1 α j g y j ⎞ ⎠ . (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">)</formula><p>Yu et al. separate the membership u ij into two independent items a i and ␣ j , and then apply generalized mean (function f) on whole component j</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">J y = 1 N N i=1 a i f (S i ), where S i = J j=1 α j g d ij . (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>Karayiannis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> proposed a generalized FCM model by modifying the membership constraint in standard FCM with weighted generalized mean. The modified constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> has the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">⎛ ⎝ J j=1 β j u ij α ⎞ ⎠ 1/α = 1. (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_36">)</formula><p>and then the membership u ij can be estimated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">u ij = 1 J J h=1 β h d ij d ih α/(1-m) -1/α . (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_38">)</formula><p>It is noted that models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> degrade to the standard FCM when p = 1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and ␣ = 1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Compared to our local GFCM algorithm, none local spatial information is taken into account in global generalized FCM methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>(3) Compared to MRF/HMRF Both generalized mean and MRF/HMRF <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> can be considered as spatial constraints to incorporate some local spatial information, and to make the model more robust to image noise. In this paper, we adopt GDM instead of MRF/HMRF for three reasons: (1) MRF/HMRF is complex and time consuming. In contrast, GDM is simple, easy and fast for implementation.</p><p>(2) MRF/HMRF resorts to the additional parameter β to keep a balance between robustness to noise and image sharpness and details. However, our model is fully free of the empirically adjusted parameter β. (3) In MRF/HMRF, for a 2-D image, the definition of neighbors (i-1 and i+1) extends to horizontal, vertical and diagonal pixels, which become a 3 × 3 square window. In our model, the neighborhood window size of GDM can be selected as 3 × 3, 5 × 5, 7 × 7, etc. Moreover, although a square window is used in this paper, windows with other shapes (e.g. diamonds or circles) can also be suitable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(4) Extension of our algorithm</head><p>Let us consider another type of fuzzy algorithm called conditional fuzzy c-means (CFCM) which is introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. CFCM is very similar as standard FCM except the membership constraint. The constraint in CFCM is</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">u ij ∈ [0, 1] , and J j=1 u ij = f i . (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">)</formula><p>where f i describes a level of involvement of y i in the constructed cluster. Recently, Wei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> modified the FCM objective function and present a novel FCM (NFCM)</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">J m = N i=1 J j=1 u m ij d ij + λ N i=1 J j=1 u ij log u ij . (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">)</formula><p>where λ ≥ 0. It can be seen that our model is general enough and the idea of usage of generalized mean can also be applied to distance function and membership in CFCM and NFCM.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Yang proposed a new FCM generalization, called a penalized FCM (PFCM), based on the modified fuzzy objective function as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">J m = N i=1 J j=1 u m ij d ij + ω N i=1 J j=1 u m ij log α j . (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_44">)</formula><p>where ω, α j ≥ 0 and J j=1 α j = 1. It can be seen that our generalized mean algorithm can be extended and then be applied to the penalized item ␣ ij in PFCM.</p><p>From the discussion above, we can conclude that although our algorithm focus on standard FCM, it can also be easily extended to improve the performance of other FCM-like algorithms based on adding some type of penalty terms to the original FCM objective function. However, to clearly demonstrate our idea, here we impose generalized mean on standard FCM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Hierarchical fuzzy c-means</head><p>In this subsection, we introduce a more flexible fuzzy algorithm called hierarchical fuzzy c-means (HFCM). Our idea is straightforward, simple and easy to implementation. We assume the distance function in traditional fuzzy model itself is a sub-fuzzy model. Thus, our algorithm is general enough and can be applied to various distance functions, whatever the function type (Euclidean distance, l 1 , l p , l ∞ norm, or kernel distance function, etc.). However, to clearly demonstrate our idea, we introduce our algorithm based on the standard FCM (Euclidean distance) in this paper. In this case, the distance function in standard FCM can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">d ij = K k=1 v n ijk dijk . (<label>23</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_46">)</formula><p>where dijk is the sub-distance function and v ijk is the sub-membership which satisfies K k=1 v ijk = 1. It is noted that the exact expression of sub-membership is v ik|j which represents the sub-cluster k belongs to cluster j. Here, we use v ijk instead of v ik|j for simple expression.</p><p>In fact, our HFCM can also be considered as a twolevel FCM: (1) the data are generated by J clusters in the first level and (2) within each cluster j; the data are generated by class-labeled sources that form sub-clusters of the large cluster in the second level. Substitution of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_45">23</ref>) into (4), the objective function of HFCM is given as </p><formula xml:id="formula_47">J mn = N i=1 J j=1 K k=1 u m ij v n ijk dijk . (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_48">)</formula><p>It can be seen that at the second level of the hierarchy, information is provided about the data along with their class labels. It is noted that we have J classes; K subclasses correspond to each class j of the first level.</p><p>The objective function J mn can be minimized in a fashion similar to the standard FCM algorithm. Taking the first derivatives of J mn with respect to u ij , v ijk and µ jk and then setting them to zero results in three necessary but not sufficient conditions for J mn to be at a local extreme. Let us first consider the derivation of the fuzzy membership (and sub-membership) function values. This can be obtained by minimizing the objective function J mn over u ij and v ijk under the constraints J j=1 u ij = 1 and K k=1 v ijk = 1. Then, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">J mn = J mn + α ⎛ ⎝ 1 - J j=1 u ij ⎞ ⎠ + β 1 - K k=1 v ijk .</formula><p>Taking the derivative of J mn with respect to u ij and setting the result to zero, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">u ij = K k=1 v n ijk dijk 1/(1-m) J h=1 K k=1 v n ihk dihk 1/(1-m)</formula><p>.</p><p>(25) Similar processing on sub-membership v ijk , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">v ijk = u m ij dijk 1/(1-n) K h=1 u m ij dijh 1/(1-n) . (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_52">)</formula><p>According to previous analysis, our algorithm is general enough and can be applied to various distance functions. To clearly demonstrate our idea, we still adopt Euclidean distance in this paper. Thus, we define dijk = y iµ jk 2 . To minimize the objective function by solving ∂J mn /∂µ jk = 0, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">µ jk = N i=1 u m ij v n ijk y i N i=1 u m ij v n ijk . (<label>27</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_54">)</formula><p>It is noticed that according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, each distance function exhibits a FCM form. This suggests that we can contrast the proposed HFCM against the traditional FCM. In addition, the HFCM with J components in its first level can be considered as an extension of the standard FCM that employs J components in total. The proposed HFCM degrades to standard FCM when we set the sub-component k equal to 1 and sub-membership v ijk = 1. Particularly, in standard FCM, all data points belong to component j depend on there distance function d ij . In contrast, the HFCM assumes that the data generated by the component j are explained in a way that depends on their sub-component labels k (for each component j, a different distance function dijk is provided). The HFCM can also be derived to a standard FCM with KJ components in total which each distance function is modeled by a FCM with J components (parameters K and J are exchangeable).</p><p>Let us take two clustering examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of HFCM. In the first example, the synthetic data consists of 1800 data point from two Gaussian components where each component contains 900 samples. These two Gaussian distributions have the following parameters (mean µ j and covariance matrices j ): µ 1 = (0, 5) T , µ 2 = (0, -5) T , 1 = 2 = diag <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. The test data is further augmented by 200 outliers, which are drawn from a Gaussian distribution, located in the middle-left of the test data. The test data and outliers are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>  and red ellipse, respectively. It can be seen that outliers pull estimated cluster center away from the true cluster center in the standard FCM. However, HFCM seems to fit the test data well and be not affected by outliers. The estimated center by FCM and HFCM are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. It can be seen that HFCM estimates more accurate center than FCM.</p><p>In the second example, the synthetic data consists of 1800 data point from three Gaussian components where each component contains 600 samples. These three Gaussian distributions have the following parameters: µ 1 = (0, 0) T , µ 2 = (3, 2) T , µ 3 = (0, 5) T , 1 = 3 = diag(1/2, 1/2), 2 = diag(1/8, 1/8). The test data is further augmented by 1800 outliers, which are drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval <ref type="bibr">[-6, 6]</ref>. The test data and outliers are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>(b), it can be seen that FCM can not classify them well. Some green, red and blue points are mixed together in the center of the figure due to the effect of the outliers. FCM also misclassify some red points which should belong to the green one (first component). However, HFCM obtains nearly perfect results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(c</ref>). The misclassification ratio (MCR) is 5.33% for FCM compared to 0.72% for HFCM. Thus, we can conclude that the additional flexibility in HFCM resolves a serious data representation drawback of the standard FCM and improves classification performance significantly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Synthetic images</head><p>In the first experiment, a three-class synthetic image (246 × 246, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3(a)</ref>) is used to compare the performance of the proposed method with others. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>(b) and (c) show the same image corrupted by Gaussian noise with zero mean and 0.12 variance, and by Speckle noise with noise density = 0.18, respectively. In order to evaluate the segmentation results, we employ the misclassification ratio (MCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> in our experiments. The value of MCR is in the [0%-100%] range, where lower values indicate better segmentation performance. The segmentation results of the Gaussian noised image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3(b)</ref>) by GGFCM, MFCM, FCM S, FLICM, HMRF-FCM, FRFCM and the proposed methods are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(a) through (g). The class number J is set to 3, based on previous experience. As we observe, GGFCM, MFCM and FCM S do not segment images well. Although FLICM, HMRF-FCM and FRFCM can reduce the effect of noise to some extent, they are still sensitive to heavy noise and misclassify some portions of pixels, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4(d)</ref>, (e) and (g). However, we observe that the proposed GHFCM yields outstanding segmentation results compared to the poor performance of their competitors, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(f).

The results obtained by different noise densities are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. As we observe, the proposed methods obtains the best results compared to the other methods, and especially for heavy noised image segmentation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Multidimensional images</head><p>In this experiment, we try to segment the multidimensional RGB color image into three classes: the blue sky, the red roof and the white wall. The original image (481 × 321) shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>(a) is corrupted by heavy Gaussian noise with mean = 0 and covariance = 0.15, and by heavy Speckle noise with noise density = 0.15.

The accuracy of segmentation for GGFCM and FRFCM is quite poor. This is expected that no spatial constraints are taken into account in GGFCM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">SAR images</head><p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are often affected by speckle noise, which originates in the SAR system's coherent nature. In this experiment, we evaluate various methods based on real RADARSAT-1 SAR image which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11(a)</ref>. RADARSAT-1 is a sophisticated Earth observation satellite developed by Canada to monitor environmental changes and the planet's natural resources.</p><p>Our purpose is to distinguish the Mountains and the River.

Existence of noise has led to a "spotty" result using GGFCM, FCM S, and FRFCM shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11(b),</ref><ref type="figure">(d</ref>) and (h), respectively. FLICM and HMRF-FCM are failed to segment the SAR image, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11</ref>(e) and (f), respectively. FLICM mixed the mountain and the river together and HMRF-FCM misclassifies some river parts. The MFCM shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11(c</ref>) gives an improved result; however, it loses some image details and is still not robust enough to image speckle. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11</ref>(g), it can be seen that the proposed GHFCM obviously overcomes these short-comings and preserve more details of mountain's ridges and river's tributaries. Through discussion above, we can conclude that the proposed GHFCM is more robust to image speckle and can preserve more image details simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we propose a novel simple and effective fuzzy clustering approach for image segmentation. The GHFCM is introduced by incorporating the hierarchical distance function and spatial constraints into the fuzzy objective function. Thus, our model can be considered as an extension of standard FCM and can degrade to FCM by setting the proper parameters. Although the idea of generalized mean and hierarchical model is adopted for standard FCM, it can be easily extended to many other modified FCM models. Compared to the standard FCM, HFCM improves data representation in sub-distance relevant to classification. Moreover, HFCM exhibits robustness with respect to the subcluster number K at the second level, and this constitutes a great advantage over the standard FCM. In GFCM, the distance function of an image pixel is influenced by the distance function of pixels in its immediate neighborhood with the help of the generalized mean.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>966Y.</head><label></label><figDesc>Zheng et al. / Image segmentation by generalized hierarchical fuzzy C-means algorithm</figDesc></figure>
