<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>is the BV (bounded variation) space, where the most crucial low-level visual cue-the edge-is permissible (see Rudin and Osher <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>, Rudin, Osher, and Fatemi <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, and Chambolle and Lions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for examples). Yet, in both the approximation community and that of numerical analysis, as far as we know, there has not been much work on the inpainting of BV functions. A recent related paper by Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> discusses the nonlinear approximation of BV functions, motivated by the wavelets thresholding technique and the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi denoising model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. The nonlinear interpolation studied therein is for the near-optimal approximation and representation of a given complete noisy image u 0 . But inpainting has a different objective, which is to recover the entire clean image u from a given incomplete noisy image u 0 observed only outside a missing domain K.</p><p>The inpainting of BV images is generally an ill-posed problem, which can be seen more clearly through a one-dimensional (1-D) example. Imagine that we know the values (or even the derivatives) of a function f at a -h and a + h. If f is smooth, then as h → 0 we can apply smooth interpolants such as Lagrange's and Hermite's to infer the values of f on (a -h, a + h) with a certain degree of precision guaranteed. But for a BV function f , all such smooth interpolants fail to work properly no matter how small h is, since a "widthless" jump can always occur in (a -h, a + h). Under the TV Radon measure, a single point in 1-D can have nonzero mass, which makes the corresponding interpolation problem ill-posed generally. (In the high-dimensional case, the BV interpolant performs better than in 1-D, due to its connection to the minimal surface problem. See, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>.)</p><p>The good news is that images as BV functions are not too intractable. Each image is a 2-D projection of a window of the 3-D world, in which individual objects often have their geometric or surface reflectivity regularities. Such regularities partially diminish the ill-posedness of the inpainting problem.</p><p>Given an image, if we partially cover it with a piece of paper of moderate size and ask a person to guess what has been occluded in the original image, most people will come up with a "rational" best guess. For example, if a green apple in a photo is partially occluded by a piece of paper, then one often first estimates the occluded boundary and then inpaints with the green color over the occluded area belonging to the apple. All these decisions are realized by the best guesses or, more scientifically, by Bayesian inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. The two ingredients of Bayesian inference are the prior model and data model. The data model is simple for most inpainting problems: the available data is simply a part of a complete image that we try to restore. Thus the prior model plays a crucial role in our inference process. For the apple experiment mentioned above, the a priori knowledge of the shape and color of an apple is helpful for a person trying to make a meaningful inpainting.</p><p>In order to develop a general inpainting model, one should never rely on the prior model of a specific class of image objects (such as apples). The model must employ generic regularities to better condition the ill-posedness. The Rudin-Osher-Fatemi BV <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> and Mumford-Shah's object-and-edge models <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> are the two most wellknown prior models for generic nontexture images. However, as Chan and Shen <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Esedoglu and Shen <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> discussed, they become less suitable in some large-scale inpainting problems where they lead to a violation of the connectivity principle in vision psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. As a result, it is clear that a good inpainting model must consider high-order geometric information such as the curvature feature of the level sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In the current paper, we study a variational inpainting model that has arisen Downloaded 06/14/13 to 128.171.57.189. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php from a second-order plane curve model-Euler's elastica. The gap between a prior model for curves and that for images is formally bridged by the level set concept: generally, a curve prior model can always be "lifted" to an image prior model once being imposed on all the level sets of an image (similar to the coarea formula in the theory of BV functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>). Indeed, this is how Masnou and Morel first proposed this model for image inpainting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Our current paper is intended to (a) study the mathematical foundation and properties of the inpainting models based on elasticas and curvatures, (b) explore the connection of this work to the earlier empirical works on PDE-based inpainting models, and (c) construct numerical PDE schemes for the associated nonlinear PDEs. Compared with Masnou and Morel's linear programming algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, the numerical PDE approach is more flexible in that it frees one from laboring over edge detection or pixel coupling along the boundaries, and also that it lifts the topological restriction on the inpainting domain K <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Euler's elasticas were first introduced and seriously studied in computer vision by Mumford <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> as a prior curve model. They were employed in the visual disocclusion program in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> to smoothly connect occluded edges and T-junctions. Earlier in approximation theory, elasticas had been introduced as nonlinear splines by Birkhoff and De Boor <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>We are now ready to introduce the layout of the paper. We begin with a brief introduction to the elasticas (section 2). Then, as in classical interpolation theory, in section 3, we first study the generic local models for nontexture images. By the method of moving frames, we are able to inpaint or interpolate the missing T-junctions or corners inside the inpainting domain based on the elastica interpolant. We then explain the approach that leads to Masnou and Morel's algorithm on individually "engineering" isophotes (i.e., level sets) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. A level set-type idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> formally "lifts" this isophote-based model to an energy functional that acts directly on gray scale images, a process that we shall call "functionalization."</p><p>The rest of the paper is devoted to the mathematical analysis and computational implementation of elastica-based inpainting models.</p><p>In section 4, by introducing the concept of the weak curvature of a general BV function, we legitimize the functionalization of the elastica energy in the BV space. The direct method for elastica inpainting is generally difficult due to the lack of classical fine properties (such as convexity and lower semicontinuities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). But for the extreme case of TV inpainting, we are able to rigorously establish the existence theorems based on the theory of BV functions. We also discuss why the nonuniqueness of the solutions to a general inpainting model should be somehow appreciated instead of being cursed. The last part of the section discusses various relaxation schemes for the constraints of the inpainting energy.</p><p>In section 5, we derive the formal Euler-Lagrange equation for a general curvaturebased inpainting model. The most interesting result is the structure of the associated flux field V , which provides a formal way to unify the earlier empirical work of Bertalmio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> on transport-based inpainting, and that of Chan and Shen on CDD-based inpainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We therefore conjecture that transport and diffusion are the two universal infinitesimal mechanisms for any PDE-based inpainting schemes.</p><p>In section 6, we explain our numerical schemes for the associated nonlinear Euler-Lagrange equation and demonstrate several computational examples. The computational schemes have been inspired by various techniques in the classical literature of computational fluid dynamics.</p><p>In the last section, we conclude with a brief discussion on the connection between Downloaded 06/14/13 to 128.171.57.189.

For a general Riemannian manifold M , the intrinsic derivative d t/ds is defined by the Levi-Civita connection or the covariant derivative (see Chern, Chen, and Lam <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, for example). Such extension onto general manifolds is motivated by inpainting problems on arbitrary surfaces in R 3 , for example, the inpainting of an incomplete image on the surface of a Coke can in computer graphics.</p><p>By the calculus of variations, it can be shown that an elastica must satisfy</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">2κ (s) + κ 3 (s) = a b κ(s).</formula><p>For example, Mumford gives a detailed derivation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.

More studies in elasticas on general Riemannian manifolds can be found in Langer and Singer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. The elastica was first seriously studied from the computer vision point of view in Mumford's paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, the introduction section of which provides a delightful view of its mathematical history. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, the key link between the elastica and computer vision is founded on the interpolation capability of elasticas, as initially proposed by Birkhoff and De Boor <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Such "nonlinear splines" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, like classical polynomial splines, are natural tools for completing the missing or occluded edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</p><p>A remarkable feature of elasticas revealed by Mumford <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> is their Bayesian rationale, which enhances the interpolating role of elasticas in image and vision analysis.

The basic assumption is that, at each step k, the larger the step size h k is, the more uncertain the turn ∆θ k will become. Precisely, ∆θ k is a Gaussian of N (0, h k σ 2 ).

Therefore, the minimization of the elastica energy (2.1), with a = λ and b = 1/(2σ 2 ), is equivalent to the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of such random curves. Remark 1. Notice that the walking drunk model presented here does not come from the discrete sampling of the Brownian motion, since for the latter (in 2-D), h 2 (not h) is exponential and the turn ∆θ is uniform along the unit circle. The dependence of the turns on the step sizes makes the paths smoother than the sampling of Brownian motions, which makes the model a valuable curve model in computer vision, where regularity is important. 3. Local (nontexture) image models and elastica isophotes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Generic local (nontexture) image models.</head><p>To model the inpainting of nontexture images, it is important to start with local and small inpainting domains. Focusing on locality is a common practice in numerical mathematics, where from differentiation, integration, and interpolation, to optimization, most well-known numerical schemes (such as the Runge-Kutta schemes, Simpson's integration rule, and the Newton-Raphson searching strategy for zeros or valleys) are inspired by the local models of the target functions, such as the linear model, parabolic model, and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. Digital inpainting, after all, is the numerical interpolation of 2-D images. Therefore, it is crucial to first understand what an image looks like locally.</p><p>Imagine that we have a small aperture with a circular shape of radius r, and that we focus on only the part that is captured within when it is moved over a 2-D gray image. Suppose that the image only contains man-made nontexture objects, and that their characteristic scale l r. What sorts of local image patches will be observed most frequently?</p><p>They can be grouped into four classes, labeled by "H," "E," "C," and "T" (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1), as follows:</p><p>(a) Class H. A local image patch belongs to this class if and only if it falls within the homogeneous regions. Such a patch has very little intensity variation. (b) Class E. This occurs when the aperture captures a fraction of the smooth edge between two objects or homogeneous regions. (c) Class C. Like class E, but the aperture captures a recognizable corner. Corners are also a universal feature of man-made objects, from tables, windows, and books, to posters. (d) Class T. This is the case in which the aperture captures a T-junction. Tjunction is an important cue for occlusion and the perception of orders in the lost dimension of range <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. A local T-junction patch is characterized by three homogeneous gray values u 1 , u 2 , and u 3 and two smooth edges-one meets the boundary at its two ends while the other at only one end due to occlusion. Downloaded 06/14/13 to 128.171.57.189. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php Notice that homogeneous regions are 2-D objects, edges are 1-D objects, and both corners and T-junctions are isolated 0-D objects. Therefore, heuristically, in terms of the probability (or frequency) of being observed through a small aperture, we have the following relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Prob(H) Prob(E) Prob(C) or Prob(T ).</formula><p>Of course, the probabilities do not necessarily represent their perceptual significance in terms of vision inference. In fact, it seems that often the scattered singular features can generate strong response from the vision system (e.g., the wavelets idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>).</p><p>Notice that class C is indeed very much "man-made" like its ancestors in our 3-D world, in the sense that a local engineering (or small perturbation) of the corner can easily change a class C patch to class E. In this sense class C is unstable and nongeneric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Local edge interpolation by elasticas: Moving frames.</head><p>Suppose an image u 0 has a local patch K missing, and we try to inpaint u 0 K based on the available information surrounding K.</p><p>By checking the available data close to K, we can easily determine which class u 0 K belongs to: H, E, or T. (Without a priori knowledge, one can never distinguish the nongeneric class C from the generic class E.) The existence of a corner or the exact configuration of the T-shape inside the inpainting domain will require extra information or additional models and algorithms (especially for the coupling of the three end points in the T-junction case). (For the corner case, for example, see Shah's recent work on elasticas with hinges <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.) In this paper, we shall assume that eventually we do know the exact class that u 0 K belongs to and the precise configurations.</p><p>The first level of approximation will be based on the straight line curve model (refer to the upper-right panel in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1). For a class H type, one can average the available boundary pixel values and inpaint u 0 K by this mean value c. For a class E type, we connect the two edge ends by a straight segment and inpaint the two objects u 1 and u 2 by their boundary mean values c 1 and c 2 . For a class C type, we make two straight shoots from the boundary end points into the inpainting domain. The orientations follow their cue left outside K. The two straight lines generate a corner and also segment the patch K into two objects u 1 and u 2 . Then u 1 and u 2 are inpainted by their boundary mean values. For the last class T, we connect the two coupled boundary end points by a straight line and shoot from the third one directly toward the interior of K, as for class C. Then the three segmented objects u 1 , u 2 , and u 3 are inpainted by their boundary mean values c 1 , c 2 , and c 3 .</p><p>A second level of approximation is based on the elastica curve model (the upperleft panel in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1). That is, we shall interpolate the boundary end points by elasticas instead of by straight line segments. We can improve the inpainting accuracy by further approximating each individual (nonedge) isophote by an elastica for the segmented regions, instead of simply making constant approximations. Therefore, we need first to inpaint the missing edges including corners and T-junctions to reduce classes E, C, and T to class H.</p><p>Along the boundary, each end point can be represented by (p, n), with p denoting its position and n the normal to the edge, which can be computed from the image available outside the inpainting domain K.</p><p>(a) For class E, to inpaint the missing smooth edge, we employ the elastica Γ that satisfies the boundary conditions (p 1 , n 1 ) and (p 2 , n 2 ).

Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php (b) For class C, to inpaint the corner, we take a moving frame approach. The corner is represented by an affine frame (p; n 1 , n 2 ), with p denoting its unknown position, and n 1 and n 2 the two unknown unit normals to the smooth edges coming from the boundary end points (p 1 , n 1 ) and (p 2 , n 2 ).

(c) For class T, we first inpaint the two coupled end points by an elastica Γ (provided that we have established such coupling from other models or algorithms, as pointed out in the second paragraph). To inpaint the occluded edge from the clue of the third boundary end point (p 3 , n 3 ), we again take the moving frame approach. Let (p, n 3 ) denote the junction position and the normal direction of the occluded edge.

(A similar philosophy has now made the level-set method of Osher and Sethian <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> a great success in the numerical computation of various interface motion problems.) An admissible curve bundle F = {γ λ } λ , which not only satisfies the boundary conditions but also avoids the two problems, is uniquely and fully characterized by an inpainting function u K that is "tangent" to u 0 along ∂K. Conversely, working with u K instead of the individual isophotes automatically resolves these problems. Thus, first we need to translate the elasticity energies (3.4) or (3.5) into ones that are directly applicable to the inpainting function u K .</p></div>

In applications, it can be defined based on the histogram h(λ) of the given image. (h(λ) denotes the frequency of pixels with gray value λ.) The histogram of an image typically contains several "humps," each of which corresponds to an object. Since human observers are very sensitive to the regularity of object boundaries, we may assign a high weight to the pixels whose gray values are typically near the "valleys" of the histogram. Therefore we may choose the weight function in the form of</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">w(λ) = W (1 -h(λ)),</formula><p>with W (h) denoting a suitable positive and increasing function.

It requires that there be no essential overlap between the boundary of the inpainting domain K and the edges of 2-D objects in the image. Imagine, in contrast, the opposite situation, in which an object is completely missing along its boundary. Then no existing image information can possibly bring it back in the absence of high-level intelligence (such as face recognition and symmetry detection). A low-level inpainting model, after all, is expected to interpolate incomplete objects based only on the hints they leave on the exterior of the inpainting domain.</p><p>Finally, the last condition in (4.6) demands finite curvatures along the inpainting boundary.

Suppose that u ∈ C 2 (K) and that p ∈ K is a regular pixel:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">∇u(p) = 0. Then κ(p) = |κ(p)|.</formula><p>Proof. Assume that the mollifier is supported on the unit ball B 1 . From the definition of convolution</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">u σ (q) = ρ σ * u(q) = B1 ρ(y)u(q + σy) dy,</formula><p>it is easy to see that there is a small neighborhood N p and some positive number a so that u σ (q) is C 2 over (σ, q) ∈ (-a, a) × N p . Since ∇u is continuous and nonvanishing at p, we can further refine N p and a so that all ∇u(q + σy) (with (σ, q, y) ∈ (-a, a) × N p × B 1 ) are concentrated enough around ∇u(p). Then, thanks to the averaging property of the mollifier, all ∇u σ (q) = (∇u) σ (q) are nonvanishing, which makes</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">n σ (q) = ∇u σ (q) |∇u σ (q)| C 1 on (-a, a) × N p .

Proof. Since curvature is a second-order local feature, we can replace γ near p by the curvature circle with radius r = 1/|κ(p)| and centered at q = p -r n, where n is one of the unit normal vectors at p. Then both the data (c + , c -) and the geometry γ are locally rotationally invariant (with respect to the center) in a neighborhood of p. Since the mollifier ρ is radially symmetric and compactly supported, as long as σ is small enough, u σ = ρ σ * u must also be locally rotationally invariant with respect to the center, which means that locally near p, γ is also an isophote of u σ . Thus under the same orientation of γ, κ σ→0 (p) = κ(p) and κ(p) = lim σ |κ σ (p)| = |κ(p)|.

In return, these earlier works help reveal the fine structure of elastica inpainting from the PDE point of view.</p><p>The first high-order PDE-based inpainting model of Bertalmio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is based on the beautiful intuition of smoothness transport along isophotes: <ref type="bibr">(5.8)</ref> where ∇ ⊥ u = (-u y , u x ) = |∇u| t, and L(u) can be any smoothness measure of the image u. For example, in the numerical experiment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, L is chosen to be the Laplacian ∆u. The model carries the transport nature since, as the evolution approaches its equilibrium state, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">∂u ∂t = ∇ ⊥ u • ∇L(u),</formula><formula xml:id="formula_79">t • ∇L(u) = 0 and ∂L(u) ∂ t = 0,</formula><p>which means that the smoothness measure remains constant along any completed isophote. Thus, in terms of the available boundary data, the image evolves as though transporting the boundary smoothness information along the restored isophotes into the inpainting domain. However, due to the lack of communication among the isophotes, the transport may result in kinks inside the inpainting domain, just as shocks may develop in traffic models. Thus in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, (5.8) is implemented with the help of intermediate steps of anisotropic diffusions. As we shall see below, such intuition is well supported by the elastica inpainting.</p><p>On the other hand, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, in order to realize the so-called connectivity principle in perceptual disocclusion, Chan and Shen proposed the CDD inpainting model</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">∂u ∂t = ∇ • g(κ) |∇u| ∇u , (5.9)</formula><p>where g : R → [0, +∞) is a continuous function satisfying g(0) = 0 and g(±∞) = +∞. If g is replaced by 1, then this is the classical TV anisotropic diffusion.
