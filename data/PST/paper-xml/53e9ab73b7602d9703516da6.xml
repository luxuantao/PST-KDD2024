<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The research of derivation in logical systems or formal theories usually focuses on axioms and theorems; nevertheless, the investigation of inference rules turns out to be a fruitful generalization of the questions studied in proof theory. One of the most remarkable features of rules, not present in the theoremhood area, is the distinction between derivable and admissible rules. The latter concept goes back to P. Lorenzen <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>; a schematic rule is admissible in a formal system S , if the set of theorems of S is closed under the rule. Description of the structure of admissible rules of a given formal system may have a practical value (admissible rules form the largest collection of inference rules which can be used in derivations while preserving the set of theorems), but more significantly, it provides an important insight in the general properties of the system.</p><p>The modern development of the theory of rules admissible in non-classical logics was inspired by a question of H. Friedman <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, whether admissibility in intuitionistic logic is decidable. The problem was thoroughly studied in the 1980s and 1990s in a series of papers by V. Rybakov, later summarized in a book <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Rybakov's deep results on semantical characterization of admissibility have provided decision procedures for admissible rules in many modal and superintuitionistic logics (thus answering positively Friedman's question), and settled various properties of sets of admissible rules and their bases (e.g. non-existence of finite bases of admissible rules for IPC and certain modal logics).</p><p>Another direction of research stemmed recently from results of S. Ghilardi on unification in intuitionistic and modal logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, which provided a different characterization of admissibility. R. Iemhoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> discovered how to use these results to construct explicit bases of admissible rules; specifically, she proved completeness of a basis for IPC earlier conjectured by D. de Jongh and A. Visser.</p><p>The main purpose of this paper is to construct explicit bases of admissible rules for a class of modal logics extending K4. The general outline of the completeness proof follows the method of R. Iemhoff; one of the differences lies in the choice of the basic notion-rather than dealing with admissible rules directly, we prefer to work with generalized rules ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ k ψ 1 , . . . , ψ .</p><p>There are several reasons why we consider this notion preferable. Intuitively speaking, the most remarkable and most important admissible rule of logics like S 4, GL, or IPC, is the disjunction property; the expressive power of the formal definition of an admissible rule should reflect this intuition. The other reasons are more technical: bases of admissible rules tend to look simpler and more natural when formulated as generalized rules, and the method we use in section 3 to prove Kripke completeness is better suited to generalized rules. The study of admissible multiple conclusion rules was already suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The material is organized as follows. Section 1 reviews basic notions and facts about normal modal logics and Kripke semantics, mainly to fix the notation; it also includes the necessary background from Ghilardi <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In Section 2 we define the concept of AR-systems as the formal syntactical counterpart to sets of admissible rules, and we describe an embedding of AR-systems in quasi-normal logics. The technical core of the paper is Section 3, where we introduce specific ARsystems corresponding to admissible rules of the logics we have in mind, and we prove completeness of these AR-systems with respect to suitable Kripke semantics. The main results on bases of admissible rules are presented in Section 4. Section 5 briefly discusses two questions on sets of admissible rules, namely their computational complexity, and maximality. Finally, in Section 6 we transfer the results of Section 4 to bases of usual (single conclusion) admissible rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Preliminaries</head><p>The modal language consists of propositional variables (a.k.a. atoms) p i , usual propositional connectives, and the unary modal connective . We introduce the abbreviations</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ϕ = ¬ ¬ϕ, ϕ = ϕ ∧ ϕ, • ϕ = ¬ ¬ϕ = ϕ ∨ ϕ, and n ϕ = • • • ϕ (with n boxes).</formula><p>A normal modal logic is a set L of modal formulas which is closed under substitution, contains all propositional tautologies and the schema</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(ϕ → ψ) → ( ϕ → ψ), (K)</formula><p>and is closed under the detachment and necessitation rules</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ϕ, ϕ → ψ ψ, (MP) ϕ ϕ. (Nec)</formula><p>The minimal normal modal logic is denoted by K. K4 is its extension by the schema</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ϕ → ϕ.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>We will not list here axioms of other modal systems which appear in this paper; in case of doubt, the reader may consult <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>If L is a normal modal logic, we write L ϕ (or, occasionally, L ϕ) for ϕ ∈ L. More generally, if Γ is a set of formulas, Γ L ϕ means that ϕ is provable from Γ using axioms and rules of L. (In particular, ϕ L ϕ; we do not restrict the symbol L to the local consequence relation.) If L contains K4, we have the following version of the deduction theorem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Γ, ϕ L ψ iff Γ L ϕ → ψ.</formula><p>A unifier for a formula ϕ( p) is a substitution σ such that L ϕ( σ). (We denote substitutions by vectors of formulas; if we write σ, it is understood that σ i is the formula to be substituted for the atom p i .) A rule ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ k ψ is L-admissible, written as ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ k | ∼ L ψ, if every substitution which unifies all ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ k also unifies ψ. A generalized rule consists of two finite sets of formulas, depicted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ k ψ 1 , . . . , ψ .</formula><p>Such a generalized rule is L-admissible (ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ k | ∼ L ψ 1 , . . . , ψ ), if every substitution which unifies all ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ k is also a unifier for some ψ j . (Both k and can be 0; for example, | ∼ L never holds, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">⊥ | ∼ L iff L is consistent.) A generalized L-admissible rule Γ | ∼ L ∆ is derivable, if Γ L ψ for some ψ ∈ ∆ ∪ {⊥}.</formula><p>A Kripke frame is a pair K, &lt; , where &lt; is a binary relation on a non-empty set K. As we deal with extensions of K4, we generally assume all frames to be transitive. (For the same reason, we will usually denote accessibility relations by the ordering symbol &lt;. Beware: this notation does not mean that the relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">&lt; is irreflexive.) A node x ∈ K is reflexive, if x &lt; x, otherwise it is irreflexive.</formula><p>The reflexivization ≤ of the accessibility relation is defined as x ≤ y iff x &lt; y or x = y. As ≤ is a preorder, it induces an equivalence relation x ≈ y iff x ≤ y and y ≤ x. The cluster of a node x is cl(x) = {y; x ≈ y}. Notice that cl(x) = {x} whenever x is irreflexive. The subframe generated by x is K x = {y; x ≤ y}. A rooted frame is a triple K, &lt;, r , where K, &lt; is a frame, and r ∈ K is such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">K = K r . A bisimulation of frames K, &lt; and K , &lt; is a binary relation B ⊆ K × K such that • if x B x</formula><p>and x &lt; y, there is y such that x &lt; y and y B y ,</p><p>• if x B x and x &lt; y , there is y such that x &lt; y and y B y .</p><p>A p-morphism is an onto function f : K K such that the graph of f is a bisimulation. Bisimulations (hence also p-morphisms) of rooted frames K, &lt;, r , K , &lt; , r are additionally required to satisfy r B r .</p><p>A Kripke model is a triple K, &lt;, , where K, &lt; is a frame, and is a satisfaction relation between K and the set of propositional variables. We extend to all formulas using the usual rules for propositional connectives, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x ϕ iff ∀y &gt; x y ϕ.</formula><p>The notions of generated and rooted models are defined similarly as for frames. A formula ϕ is satisfied in a rooted model K, &lt;, r, if r ϕ, and it is satisfied in a model K, &lt;, if x ϕ for all x ∈ K. ϕ is valid in a frame or rooted frame, if it is satisfied in every (rooted) model based on this frame. Generated submodels preserve satisfaction. As a consequence, a formula is valid in a frame K, &lt; iff it is valid in all its generated subframes. Bisimulations and p-morphisms of (rooted) models are defined as for frames, with the additional condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">• if x B x , then x p iff x p for every atom p.</formula><p>It follows that bisimulations of models preserve satisfaction of all formulas, and p-morphisms of frames preserve validity. If K, &lt;, r, and K , &lt; , r , are rooted models, we write K r ∼ K r if there exists a bisimulation of K, &lt;, r, and K , &lt; , r , .</p><p>Let L be a normal modal logic. An L-frame is a frame which validates all theorems of L. A (rooted) L-model is a (rooted) model based on an L-frame. The logic L is complete, if every formula ϕ which is valid in all L-frames is derivable in L. L has the finite model property (FMP), if every formula valid in all finite L-frames is derivable.</p><p>If L has FMP, we define Mod L (ϕ) as the set of all finite rooted L-models which satisfy ϕ. MOD L (ϕ) is the set of finite rooted L-models K, &lt;, r, such that ϕ is satisfied in the model K, &lt;, ; i.e. MOD L (ϕ) = Mod L ( ϕ).</p><p>The box-depth d(ϕ) of a formula ϕ is the maximal number of nested boxes in ϕ, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">d(p i ) = 0, d(ϕ • ψ) = max{d(ϕ), d(ψ)} if • is a propositional connective, and d( ϕ) = 1 + d(ϕ). If Γ is a finite set of formulas, we put d(Γ) = max{d(ϕ); ϕ ∈ Γ}.</formula><p>Fine <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> introduced approximations ∼ n to the bisimulation relation. We define ∼ n by induction on n:</p><p>• K x ∼ 0 K x iff x and x satisfy the same propositional variables,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">• K x ∼ n+1 K x iff K x ∼ 0 K x , ∀y &gt; x ∃y &gt; x K y ∼ n K y ,</formula><p>and vice versa.</p><p>All ∼ n are equivalence relations, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∼ 0 ⊇ ∼ 1 ⊇ ∼ 2 ⊇ • • • ⊇ ∼; for finite models, we have K x ∼ K x iff ∀n K x ∼ n K x .</formula><p>The importance of the relations ∼ n is explained by the following result. PROPOSITION 1.1 (Fine <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) Let M be a set of finite rooted L-models in a finite number of variables. Then M is closed under</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">∼ n iff M = Mod L (ϕ) for some ϕ of depth d(ϕ) ≤ n.</formula><p>In particular, ∼ n preserves satisfaction of formulas of box-depth at most n. Now we introduce the fundamental result of S. Ghilardi on projective formulas. Let L be a normal extension of K4 with FMP. A formula ϕ( p) is L-projective, if there is a substitution χ such that (i) L ϕ( χ), (ii) ϕ L p i ≡ χ i for every atom p i . χ is the projective substitution for ϕ.</p><p>A class M of finite rooted L-models has the L-extension property, if it is closed under isomorphism, and the following holds for any rooted L-model K, &lt;, r, with |cl(r)| = 1: if K x ∈ M for every x r, then there exists K ∈ M identical to K except for satisfaction of atoms in r. THEOREM 1.2 (Ghilardi <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) Let L be a normal extension of K4 with FMP. A formula ϕ is L-projective if and only if MOD(ϕ) has L-extension property.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">AR-systems</head><p>We introduce the notion of an AR-system as the syntactical framework in which we will investigate the admissibility relation Γ | ∼ ∆. This also clarifies what we mean by a basis of admissible generalized rules. (The usual definition of a basis for single-conclusion rules based on composition does not make nearly as much sense for the generalized rules.) DEFINITION 2.1 Let L be a normal extension of K4. An AR-system over L is a set A of sequents of the form Γ ∆ (where Γ and ∆ are finite sets of formulas), which is closed under cut, weakening, and substitution, and contains all sequents Γ ϕ such that Γ L ϕ. We identify L with the minimal AR-system over L. A set X of sequents axiomatizes A over L, if A is the smallest AR-system over L which contains X. (We will generally assume that X is already closed under substitution.)</p><p>The set of all L-admissible generalized rules is clearly an AR-system; its axiomatization over L is called a basis.</p><p>A model K, &lt;, satisfies an AR-sequent Γ ∆, if it satisfies some formula from ∆, or if it does not satisfy all formulas from Γ. Γ ∆ is valid in a frame K, &lt; , if it is satisfied in all models based on K, &lt; .</p><p>If Γ is a set of formulas, we put Γ = { ϕ; ϕ ∈ Γ}, Γ = ϕ∈Γ ϕ, and Γ = ϕ∈Γ ϕ. The characteristic formula of the sequent Γ ∆ is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Γ → ∆.</formula><p>If X is a set of AR-sequents axiomatizing an AR-system A over L, we define A to be the modal logic axiomatized by the detachment rule, theorems of K4, L, and (substitution instances of) characteristic formulas of sequents from X. (In general, A is not a normal logic; however, notice that L is always normal.)</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">A rooted frame K, &lt;, r is an L -frame, if &lt; is transitive, r is irreflexive, and K {r} is an L-frame. (Notice that Γ ∆ is valid in K {r} iff the characteristic formula of Γ ∆ is valid in K.)</formula><p>The representation of AR-systems by the logics A is a convenient way to avoid development of ad hoc semantical methods for such systems. As we will see shortly, this embedding is faithful, due to the free-cut elimination theorem for classical propositional logic (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>): THEOREM 2.2 Assume that a sequent Γ =⇒ ∆ follows from a set X of sequents. Then there is a GK-proof π of Γ =⇒ ∆ using extra initial sequents from X, such that every cut formula in π has a direct ancestor in a sequent in X.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEMMA 2.3</head><p>Let A be an AR-system over L. Then A is conservative over A, i.e., a sequent Γ ∆ is provable in A if and only if its characteristic formula is provable in A .</p><p>PROOF. The 'only if' direction is easy, we will show the 'if' direction. Let GKA be the extension of the classical propositional Gentzen calculus GK by initial sequents of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">(ϕ → ψ), ϕ =⇒ ψ, ϕ =⇒ ϕ, =⇒ λ, Γ =⇒ ∆,</formula><p>where L λ, and Γ ∆ is any axiom of A. Clearly, A proves the characteristic formula of Γ ∆ iff GKA proves the sequent Γ =⇒ ∆. If we consider boxed formulas as new propositional atoms for a while, we can apply Theorem 2.2, and obtain a GKA-proof π of Γ =⇒ ∆ such that each cut formula appears in an initial sequent. By the subformula property, every formula in π is a (propositional) subformula of a formula from Γ∪∆, or a cut formula. This implies that every formula in π is boxed; in particular, π cannot use any introduction rules for propositional connectives, the only derivations in π are thus cuts and weakenings. (We consider sequents of GK to consist of sets of formulas rather than sequences, thus we do not need exchange and contraction rules.) If we remove the boxes in front of all formulas, and change the sequent arrow to , we get an A-proof of Γ ∆.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEMMA 2.4</head><p>Let L be a complete normal extension of K4. Then L is sound and complete with respect to the class of L -frames. If moreover L has FMP, then L has FMP as well. PROOF. Soundness is straightforward. Assume that L ϕ, let S be a finite set containing ϕ, and closed under negation and subformulas, and let X ⊆ S be a maximal L -consistent set such that ¬ϕ ∈ X. Put Y = {ψ; ψ ∈ X}. For any ψ such that ¬ ψ ∈ X, the set Y ∪ Y ∪ {¬ψ} is L-consistent: otherwise we would have L Y → ψ, thus L ( Y → ψ), and K4 + L Y → ψ, contradicting the consistency of X. By completeness of L, there exists a rooted L-model K ψ , &lt; ψ , r ψ , such that r ψ ψ, and r ψ Y ∪ Y. We construct a new model K, &lt;, r, by taking the disjoint union of all K ψ , and putting a new irreflexive root r below all the other nodes. The forcing of atoms in r is defined by r p iff p ∈ X.</p><p>We have that &lt; is transitive (each &lt; ψ is transitive as L ⊇ K4), and K {r} is an L-frame (as Lframes are closed under taking disjoint unions). A straightforward induction on complexity shows that r X, thus r ϕ. If L has FMP, we can take all K ψ to be finite, in which case K is also finite.</p></div>

Let y ∈ K be a tight predecessor of y, reflexive or irreflexive according to the reflexivity of z, and modify the satisfaction of atoms in z to agree with y. Put W = ( i W x i ) * and K = ( i K y i ) * with satisfaction inherited from W and K, where * is • or • as appropriate.

Assume first that L is extensible. Soundness: assume that L is not reflexive, and r i&lt;n ( ϕ → ψ i ). Choose y i &gt; r such that y i ϕ ∧ ¬ψ i , and let x &gt; r be an irreflexive tight predecessor of {y i ; i &lt; n}. Then x ϕ, but x ψ i for any i, thus r ( ϕ → i ψ i ).

LEMMA 4.9 The rule ¬ j&lt;m (ϕ j → ϕ j ) | ∼ ⊥ is admissible in any normal modal logic. PROOF. Assume L ¬ j&lt;m (ϕ j → ϕ j ), we will show that L is inconsistent. We have L ¬ j ϕ j , thus L extends D = K + . As L is closed under substitution, we may assume that the formulas ϕ j do not contain any propositional variables.

On the other hand, Theorem 4.10 shows that the only extension of S 4.3 maximal wrt admissibility is the logic K + ϕ ≡ ϕ. R.

We will show how to construct a basis of single-conclusion admissible rules, once we have a basis for the generalized rules; we begin with the simple case of linear modal systems. PROPOSITION 6.1 Let X be a set of single-conclusion rules, Y a set of rules with empty conclusion, and A the AR-system axiomatized by X ∪ Y over a logic L. Then</p><p>PROOF. By a straightforward induction on the length of derivation in A, we can show that for every rule Γ ∆ provable in A, there is ψ ∈ ∆ ∪ {⊥} such that Γ ψ is provable in the system axiomatized by X ∪ {Γ ⊥; Γ ∈ Y}. The result follows as ⊥ ϕ is L-derivable.

Theorems 4.5 and 6.4 immediately imply the result for K4, GL, and S 4. Then we proceed as in the proof of Theorem 4.5, except that we use Π ϕ instead of Π ϕ . REMARK 6.6 Corollary 6.5 may be applicable even when Theorem 4.5 is not. For example, the results of Section 4 are insufficient to determine the generalized admissible rules of K4. In some cases, it is possible to characterize generalized admissible rules by their single-conclusion fragment.

DEFINITION 6.7 Let L be a modal logic. A substitution σ is less general than σ , written as σ ≤ σ , if there is a substitution τ such that L σ i ( τ) ≡ σ i for every i. The logic L has filtering unification, if the set of unifiers of any formula is directed, i.e., for every formula ϕ and every unifiers σ 1 and σ 2 of ϕ, there is a unifier σ of ϕ such that σ 1 ≤ σ and σ 2 ≤ σ.

Assume Γ | ∼ L ψ for every ψ ∈ ∆ ∪ {⊥}, and fix unifiers σ ψ of Γ such that ψ( σ ψ ). As L has filtering unification, there exists a unifier σ of Γ more general than each σ ψ .
