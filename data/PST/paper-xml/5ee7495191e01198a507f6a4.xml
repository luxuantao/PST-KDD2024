<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Learning disentanglement aims at finding a low dimensional representation, which consists of multiple explanatory and generative factors of the observational data. The framework of variational autoencoder is commonly used to disentangle independent factors from observations. However, in real scenarios, the factors with semantic meanings are not necessarily independent. Instead, there might be an underlying causal structure due to physics laws. We thus propose a new VAE based framework named CausalVAE, which includes causal layers to transform independent factors into causal factors that correspond to causally related concepts in data. We analyze the model identifiabitily of CausalVAE, showing that the generative model learned from the observational data recovers the true one up to a certain degree. Experiments are conducted on various datasets, including synthetic datasets consisting of pictures with multiple causally related objects abstracted from physical world, and a benchmark face dataset CelebA. The results show that the causal representations by CausalVAE are semantically interpretable, and lead to better results on downstream tasks. The new framework allows causal intervention, by which we can intervene any causal concepts to generate artificial data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Unsupervised disentangled representation learning is of importance in various applications such as speech, object recognition, natural language processing, recommender systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hsu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ma et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hsieh et al., 2018)</ref>. The reason is that it would help enhancing the performance of models, i.e. improving the generalizability, robustness against adversarial attacks as well as the explanability, by learning data's latent representation. One of the most common frameworks for disentangled representation learning is Variational Autoencoders (VAE), a deep generative model trained using backpropagation to disentangle the underlying explanatory factors. To achieve disentangling via VAE, one uses a penalty function to regularize the training of the model by reducing the gap between the distribution of the latent factors and a standard Multivatrate Gaussian. It is expected to recover the latent variables if the observations in real world are generated by countable independent factor. To further enhance the disentangement, a line of methods consider minimizing the mutual information between different latent factors. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Higgins et al. (2017)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burgess et al. (2018)</ref> adjust the hyperparameter to force latent codes to be independent of each other. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kim &amp; Mnih (2018)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen et al. (2018)</ref> further improve the independent by reducing total correlation. The theory of disentangled representation learning is still at its early stage. We face problems such as the lack of a formal definition for disentangled representations and identifiability of disentanglement of generic models in unsupervised learning. To fill the gap, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Higgins et al. (2018)</ref> proposed a new formalization of alignment between real world and latent space, and it is the first work which gives a formal definition of disentanglement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Locatello et al. (2018)</ref> challenged the common settings of state-of-the-arts, arguing that they can not find an identifiable model without inductive bias. Although they do consider the unreasonable aspect of disentanglement tasks, there are still unsolved problems like identifiability and explainability of the independent factors, or learnability of parameters from observations. Common disentangling methods make a general assumption that the observations of real world are generated by countable independent factors. The recovered independent factors are considered good representations of data. We challenge this assumption, as in many real world situations, meaningful factors are connected with causality. Let us consider an example of a swinging pendulum Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the direction of the light l and the pendulum p are causes of the location loc and length of shadow len. We aim at learning deep representations that correspond to the four concepts. Obviously, these concepts are not independent, i.e. the direction of the light and the pendulum determine the location and the length of the shadow. There exists various kinds of causal model which could measure this causal relationship i.e. Linear Structual Equation Models (SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Shimizu et al., 2006)</ref>. Existing methods for disentangled representation learning like Î²-VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Higgins et al., 2017)</ref> might not work as they forces the learned latent code to be as independent as possible. We argue the necessity to learn the causal representation as it allows us to intervention. For example, if we manage to learn latent codes corresponding to those four concepts, we can control the shape of the shadow without interrupting the generation of the light and the pendulum. This corresponds to the do-calculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Pearl, 2009)</ref> in causality, where the system operates under the condition that certain variables are controlled by external forces.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a causal disentangled representation learning framework that recovers dependent factors by introduce Linear SEM into variation autoencoder framework. We enforce the structure to the learned latent code by designing a loss function that penalizes the deviation of the learned graph to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In addition, we analyze the identifiablilty of the proposed generative model, to guarantee an the learned disentangled codes are similar with the true one.</p><p>To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on the dataset which consists of multiple causally related objects. We demonstrate empirically that The learned factors are with semantic meanings and can be intervened to generate artificial images that do not appear in training data.</p><p>We highlight our contributions of this paper as follows:</p><p>â¢ We propose a new framework of generative model to achieve causal disentanglement learning.</p><p>â¢ We develop a theory on identifiability of our generative models, which guarantees that the true generative model is recoverable up to certain degree.</p><p>â¢ Experiments with synthetic and real world images are conducted to show the causal representations learned by proposed method have rich semantics and more effective for downstream tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Works &amp; Preliminary</head><p>In this section, we firstly provide background knowledge on disentangled representation learning, and we shall focus on recent state-of-the-arts using variational autoencoders. We review some recent advance of causality in generative models.</p><p>In the rest of the paper, we denote the latent variables by z with factorized density p(z) = Î  d i=1 p(z i ) where d &gt; 1, and p(z|x) the posterior of the latent variables given the observation x .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Disentanglement &amp; Identifiability Problems</head><p>Disentanglement is a typical concept towards independent factorial representation of data. The classic method for identifying intrinsic independent factors is ICA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Comon, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jutten &amp; Karhunen, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Comon (1994)</ref> prove model identifiability of ICA in linear case. However, the identifiability of linear ICA model could not be extended to non-linear settings directly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyvarinen &amp; Morioka (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brakel &amp; Bengio (2017)</ref> proposed a general identidfiability result for nonliear ICA, which links to the ideas of disentanglement under variational autoencoder. The disentangled representation learning learns mutually independent latent factors by an encoder-decoder framework. In the process, a standard normal distribution is used as prior  , whose prior distribution is assumed to be standard Multivariate Gaussian. Then it is transformed by the causal layer to be causal representation z. The z are assumed to be with a conditional prior distribution p(z|u). z is taken as the input of the decoder to reconstruct observation x.</p><p>of latent code. They use complex neural functions q(z|x) to approximate parameterized conditional probability p(z|x). This framework was extended by various existing works. Those works often introduce new independence constraints on the original loss function, leading to various disentangling metrics. Î²-VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Higgins et al., 2017)</ref> proposes an adaptation framework which adjusts the weight of KL term to balance between independence of disentangled factors and reconstruction performance. While factor VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref> proposes a new frame work which focuses solely on the independence of factors.</p><p>The aforementioned unsupervised algorithms do not perform well in some situations which content complex dependency among each factors, possibly because of lacking Inductive Bias and identidfiability of the generative model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Locatello et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The identidfiability problem in variational autoencoder are defined as follows: if the parameters Î¸ learned from data leads to a marginal distribution that equals the true one produced by Î¸, i. e., p Î¸ (x) = p Î¸ (x), then the joint distribution also matches p Î¸ (x, z) = p Î¸ (x, z). It means that the learned parameters is identidfiability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Khemakhem et al. (2019)</ref> prove that the unsupervised variational autoencoder training results in infinite numbers of distinct models inducing the same data distributions, which means that the underlying ground truth is non-identifiable via unsupervised learning. On the contrary, by leveraging a few labels for supervision, one is able to recover the true model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mathieu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Locatello et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kulkarni et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head><p>In this section, we present our method by starting with a new definition of latent representation, and then give a framework of disentanglement using supervision. At last, we give theoretical analysis of the model identifiability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Causal Model</head><p>To formalize causal representation framework, we consider n concepts in real world which have specific physical meanings. The concepts in observations are causally mixed by the causal relationship causal graph A *elaborate it in introduction.</p><p>As we mentioned, meaningful concepts are mostly not independent factors. We thus introduce causal representation in this paper. The causal representation is a latent data representation with a joint distribution that can be described by a probabilistic graphical model, specially a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We consider linear models in the paper, i.e. Linear Structural Equation models (SEM) on latent factors z as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">z = A T z + = (I â A T ) â1 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>â¼ N (0, I).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">)<label>2</label></formula><p>where z â R n is structural representation of n concepts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Generative Model</head><p>Our model is under the framework of VAE-based disentanglement. In additional to the encoder and the decoder structures, we introduce a causal layer to learn causal representations. The causal layer exactly implements a Linear SEM as described in Eq. 1, where (I â A T ) â1 is the parameters to learn in this layer.</p><p>Unsupervised learning of the model might be infeasible due to the identifiability issue discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Locatello et al., 2018)</ref>. As a result, the learnability of the causal layer is in question, and predefined casual representation is not identifiable. To address this issue, similar to iVAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Khemakhem et al., 2019)</ref>, we use the additional information associated with the true causal concepts as supervising signals. The additional observations must include the information of real concepts like the label, pixel level observations. We build a causal conditional generative framework which uses the additional observations from causal concepts. We will discuss the identifiability of models given additional observations later.</p><p>We follow similar definition and notation to iVAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Khemakhem et al., 2019)</ref>. Denote by x â R d the observed variables and u â R n the additional information. u i corresponds to the i-th concept in real causal system.

Compared with those learned by the state-of-the-arts, the representation learned by our method performs well in both the synthetic causal image dataset and real world face data CelebA.</p><p>We test our CausalVAE on two tasks. The first task is factor interventions, and the second is downstream tasks, namely image classification.</p><p>In our experiments, the structure of the decoder largely influences the results. Thus, we use two designed decoders. The first one decodes the concepts separately and sum them up as the final output, and the second one decodes all concepts using a single neural network. The structures are in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">SYNTHETIC DATA</head><p>We do experiments on the scenarios containing causally structured entities or concepts. We run models on a synthetic dataset, which include images consisting of causally related objects. A data generator is used to produce the images as model inputs. We will release our data generator soon.</p><p>Pendulum: We generate images with 3 entities (pendulum, light, shadow) which include 4 concepts (pendulum angle, light angle, shadow location, shadow length). The picture includes a pendulum. The angles of pendulum and the light are changing overtime. We use the projection laws to generate the shadows. The shadow are influenced by the light and angle of the pendulums. The causal graph of concepts is showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">BANCHMARK DATASET</head><p>In real world systems, cause and effect relationships commonly exist. To test our proposed method in these kinds of scenarios, we choose a banchmark CelebA<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , which is widely used in computer vision tasks. In this dataset, there are in total 200k human images with labels on different concepts. We focus on 3 concepts (age, gender and beard) on human faces in this dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Baselines</head><p>CausalVAE-unsup: CausalVAE-unsup is the method under unsupervised setting. The architecture of the model is the same as CausalVAE but the additional observations are not used. We adjust the loss function by removing the additional observation.</p><p>Î²-VAE: Î²-VAE is a common baseline for unsupervised disentanglement works. The dimensions of the latent representation are the same as that used in CausalVAE. The Standard Multivariate Gaussian distribution is adopted as the prior of latent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DC-IGN:</head><p>This baseline model is the model under supervised setting. They generate priors of latent variables conditional on the labels. As the case of Î²-VAE, dimensions of latent variables are set in line with our method.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Intervention experiments</head><p>Intervention experiments aim at testing if certain dimension of the latent codes has understandable semantic meanings. We control the value of latent vector by do-calculus operation introduced before, and check the reconstructed images.</p><p>For the experiments, all images of the dataset are used to train our proposed model CausalVAE and other baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1.">SYNTHETIC</head><p>For the experiments on synthetic dataset, we use different latent variable dimensions. We use 4 and 2 concepts on pendulum and water dataset, respectively. Then in all the experiments, we set the hyperparameter Î± = 1.</p><p>We use CausalVAE-a to represent the CausalVAE model with decoder (a), and CausalVAE-b to represent the CausalVAE model with decoder (b). The same rules apply to the DC-IGN model.</p><p>We intervened 4 concepts of pendulum, and the results are showed in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The intervention strategy are illustrated in following step: 1) we learned a CausalVAE model; 2) we put a pendulum image into encoder and get the latent code z. 3) we change the value of z i as 0. For example, when we want to intervene gender, we will change the value of z i=light directly as 0 and keep other z i =light unchanged. 4) we put the total changed latent code z into decoder and got reconstruct image.</p><p>In implementation of CausalVAE, similar to Î²-VAE, we adjust the KL term in ELBO by multiplying a beta:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">Î² 1 D(q Ï ( |x)||p( )) + Î² 2 D(q Ï (z|x, u)||p Î¸ (z|u))</formula><p>The hyperparameters of CausalVAE Î² 1 = 0.1, Î² 2 = 0.3.</p><p>Since we set the latent value as constant 0, if we controlled concept successfully, the pattern of controlled concept in one image will be the same as other images in its line. For example, when we control pendulum angel in 4(a), the first line shows that the pendulum angle in each images are almost same. And the same with light angle, each lights in different images of the second line are in the middle of top of images. And other concepts in line 3 and line 4 show similar effect.</p><p>From the results of CausalVAE with decoder (a) showed by Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(a), we find that the when we control the angle of light and pendulum, the location and length of shadows change correspondingly. But controlling the shadow factors, the light and pendulum are not affected. This result does not appear when we use decoder (b).</p><p>For experiments using decoder (b), controlling the two causes (pendulum angle and light angle), the two effects (shadow length and shadow location) do not change the reconstructed images in an expected way. In addition, controlling the effects factors in the latent representation does not influence the reconstructed images. The reason is that the decoder (b) itself may be an physical model which reasons out the effect factors based on the cause factors. The information contained in effect factors is hence not useful.</p><p>Then we analyze the results of DC-IGN. The intervention results are showed in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(c) (d). Results show that there exists a problem that the control of causes sometimes does not influence the effects. This is because they do not have a causal layer to model the factors so that the learned factors are not concepts we expect.</p><p>We also test CausalVAE on water dataset. This scenario has two concepts. The intervention on the ball size (cause) influences the water height (effect), but the intervention on the effect does not influence the causes. We also find that the results have some fluctuations. The control of the concepts is not as good as that in the pendulum experiments. It is possibly because two concepts are related by a bijective function (one-to-one mapping), and it brings difficulty for the model to understand casual relations between concepts.</p><p>In water experiments, we also find that the decoder (a) performs better than decoder (b). We do not use the unsupervised method in these experiments because it will not guarantee all the representations are aligned to the concepts well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2.">HUMAN FACE</head><p>We also executed the experiments on real world banchmark data CelebA. In this kind of scenarios, the causal system is often complex, which has heterogeneous causes and effects. It is hard to observe all the concepts in the causal systems. In this experiments, we focus on only 3 concepts (age, gender and beard). Other concepts will possibly be confounders in system. Decoder (a) is used in our experiments.</p><p>We conducted our intervention experiments by following step: 1) we learned a CausalVAE model; 2) we put a human picture into encoder and get the latent code z. 3) we change the value of z i from -0.5 to 0.5, in which each z i are correspond to the concept respectively. For example, when we want to intervene gender, we will change the value of z i=gender directly from -0.5 to 0.5 and keep other z i =gender unchanged. 4) we put the total changed latent code z into decoder and got reconstruct picture.</p><p>Different with synthetic data, we did not change the value of latent code as constant 0 but set the value in a range of number.</p><p>Thus the figures will show the concept changing clearly.</p><p>The Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> demonstrate the result of CausalVAE under the parameters Î² 1 = 0.1, Î² 2 = 0.2. And (a)(b)(c) show the intervention experiments on concepts of age, gender and beard respectively. The interventions perform well that when we intervened the cause concept gender, not only the appearance of gender but the beard changed. In contrast, when we intervened effect concept beard, the gender in figure Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(c) are not changed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Downstream Task</head><p>We also use the representation to do the downstream task on synthetic data. In this paper, we conduct tasks of image classification. We use the latent causal representation as the input of the classifier, and do experiments on predictions of causes and effects.</p><p>The 80% of dataset are used as the training data and the remaining are for testing. The cause conceptual vectors learned by our model are the inputs of a classifier, to predict either the cause labels or effect labels. The cause labels on pendulum dataset are produced by equally partitioning the angles 0 to 90 degree into 6 classes. The effect labels are constructed by dividing the original additional observations associated with the concepts into 3 classes. In water dataset, classifications on cause label and effect label are all binary classifications. The results are showed in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. It shows that using the latent codes learned by CausalVAE and DC-IGN, in general, leads to better classification performance than using that learned by other baselines. Our proposed method achieves the best performance. The choice of decoder does not have significant influences on the results when our model is used. However, it has a clear influence on the results of unsupervised baseline models like CausalVAE-unsup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a framework for latent representation learning. We argue that causal representation is good representation for machine learning tasks, and incorporate a causal layer to learn this representation under the framework of variational autoencoder. We give identifiability result of the model when additional observations are available for supervised learning. The method is tested on synthetic and real datasets, on both intervention experiments and downstream tasks. Our viewpoint is expected to bring new insights into the domain of representation learning.

Downstream Task Here we show the loss curves during the training. We use 85% of the synthetic data for training. We present the experiments on two synthetic data and each one includes the experiments of identifying cause labels and effect labels. In addition, CausalVAE achieves better accuracy than most of the baselines. It shows evidence that our proposed method learns conceptual representations</title>

	<note>When CausalVAE controls the effect latent variables beard, it will not change other concepts on the reconstructed images. However, in DO-experiments under DC-IGN, other conceptual parts like gender will change even though we only intervene on the beard dimension.
