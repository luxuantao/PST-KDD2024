<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Due to Hintikka, the 'true belief' components of Plato's celebrated tripartite definition of knowledge as justified true belief have been fairly formalized by means of modal logic and its possible worlds semantics. Despite the fact that the justification condition has received the greatest attention in epistemology (cf., for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>), it lacked a formal representation. The issue of finding a formal epistemic logic with justification has been discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Such a logic should contain assertions of the form 2F (F is known), along with those of the form t:F (t is a justification for F).</p><p>In this paper 1 we introduce justification into formal epistemology by combining Hintikka-style epistemic modal logic with justification calculi arising from the logic of proofs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. In particular, we consider natural combinations of epistemic modal logic S4 with the logic of proofs LP which use the following plausible assumptions: (1) each axiom has justification; (2) justification is checkable; (3) any justification is compatible with any other justification; (4) justification assertion of a statement implies knowledge of this statement.</p><p>The proposed approach is flexible with respect to both the knowledge/belief component for 2F and the justification component for t : F , which can be chosen independently. In addition to the logic of proofs LP there are other known modifications of justification systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, each capturing its own set of properties; this opens the way to a variety of systems for epistemic logic with justification.</p><p>Formalization of justification significantly expands the expressive power of epistemic logic and provides a new tool for formal studies in epistemology and applications. Here are some epistemological notions which seem to be affected by this new development.</p><p>1. The traditional Hintikka-style modal logic approach to knowledge has the well-known defect of logical omniscience, caused by an unrealistic stipulation that an agent knows all logical consequences of his/her assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. The usual epistemic modality 2F should be regarded as 'potential knowledge' or 'knowability' (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>) rather than actual knowledge. Epistemic systems with justification address the issue of logical omniscience in a natural way. A justified knowledge t:F cannot be asserted without presenting an explicit justification t for F , hence justified knowledge is not logically omniscient. This property was formally established for the logic of proofs LP in a recent work by R. Kuznets <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> who showed that for any valid in LP knowledge assertion t:F there exists an LP-proof for F which length is linear in the length of t:F .</p><p>2. Epistemic logic with justifications was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to offer a new approach to common knowledge. A new modal operator Jϕ for justified knowledge introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is defined as a forgetful projection of justification assertions t:ϕ in a multi-agent epistemic logic with common justification. It turned out that justified knowledge is a special constructive version of common knowledge and can be used as such in solving specific problems. Justified knowledge is more flexible and in many respects easier than the traditional common knowledge.</p><p>3. Justification enables us to formulate new epistemic principles. For example, in the context of mathematical provability, the modal principle of negative introspection ¬2F → 2¬2F is not valid. The explicit version of it, ¬(x:F ) → t(x):¬(x:F ), does not hold in the logic of proofs LP either. However, negative introspection in a mixed explicit-implicit form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">¬(t:F ) → 2¬(t:F )</formula><p>is valid in the provability semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which provides a good reason for considering this principle in the general epistemic context.</p><p>4. The proposed framework provides formal tools for exploring solutions of the foundational Gettier problem of augmenting the tripartite JTB definition of knowledge (cf., for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>). Within the basic epistemic systems introduced in this paper, the Gettier counterexamples fail because of assumption that any 'justified' sentence should be true. This may be regarded as a kind of a 'no false lemmas' formal solution to the Gettier problem. However, we are not taking sides in this issue: other approaches to the Gettier problem can be formally analysed within epistemic logic with justification as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The origins of epistemic logic with justification</head><p>The logic of proofs LP was inspired by the classical works of the 1930s by Kolmogorov <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and Gödel <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> (see also surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>). LP describes all valid principles of proof operators t:F</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t is a proof of F in Peano Arithmetic PA (2.1)</formula><p>with an appropriate set of operations on proofs sufficient to realize the whole of modal logic S4 explicitly. A similar explicit counterpart of S5 was found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Explicit versions of modal logics K, T, D, K4, and D4 were described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref>A semantical approach to the logic of proofs has been developed in the papers by Mkrtychev <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and Fitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, where the semantics of justification assertions t:F as 'F holds and t is a justification for F ' was coined.</p><p>Joint logics of proofs and provability, studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, are of special interest for the purposes of this paper, since they serve as prototypes of epistemic logic with justification.</p><p>In this paper, we study two systems of epistemic logics with justification. The basic one, S4LP, consists of S4 combined with LP as a calculus of justification and the principle t:F → 2F connecting justification with knowledge. The other system, S4LPN, is S4LP augmented by the principle of explicit negative introspection ¬(t:F ) → 2¬(t:F ), which first came up in the logics of proofs and provability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We establish soundness and completeness theorems for S4LP and S4LPN with respect to epistemic semantics (called AF-semantics), which is a proper adaptation of Fitting semantics for LP to the extended language with epistemic modalities and justification. Furthermore, both S4LP and S4LPN are shown to enjoy the arithmetical provability semantics when 2F is interpreted as the so-called strong provability operator (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>):</p><p>F is true and provable in Peano Arithmetic PA .</p><p>Systems S4LP and S4LPN were introduced in our technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, where Fitting models of the logic of proofs LP were adapted for epistemic logic with justification. Soundness of S4LP with respect to Fitting models, Theorem 6.8 and Theorem 7.1 of the current paper were established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Later in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Fitting established the completeness of S4LP with respect to Fitting models. A general notion of an AF-model covering all known systems of epistemic logic with justification, S4LP and S4LPN including, was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The logic of proofs as a calculus of justification</head><p>The logic of proofs naturally extends classical propositional logic by adding symbolically represented proofs into the language of the system. Internal proof terms in LP are called proof polynomials. A new formula formation rule is postulated, stating that t : F is a formula whenever t is a proof polynomial and F is an arbitrary formula. Hence the language of LP is a general propositional proof-carrying language. According to the completeness theorems from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, LP captures exactly the set of all valid logical principles concerning propositions and mathematical proofs. Moreover, by the realization theorem from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, proof polynomials suffice to recover the explicit provability content in all S4-theorems (and therefore all intuitionistic propositional theorems) by realizing modalities in the latter with appropriate proof terms. In a more general setting, LP may be regarded as a device that makes reasoning about knowledge explicit and keeps track of the justification.</p><p>Here are some formal definitions. DEFINITION 3.1 Proof polynomials are terms built from proof variables x, y, z, . . . and proof constants a, b, c, . . . by means of three operations: application '•' (binary), union '+' (binary), and proof checker '!' (unary).

LP2 is the verifiability property of evidence: for any justification t of F , the result of applying a checker to t, !t, provides a justification of t:F . LP3 reflects the monotonicity principle: a justification for F remains a justification after adding any additional evidence.

With each derivation in LP we associate a constant specification CS that consists of formulas introduced in this derivation by the rule of constant specification. LP is closed under substitutions of proof polynomials for proof variables and formulas for propositional variables, and LP enjoys the deduction theorem.</p><p>In addition to the arithmetical completeness theorem, LP enjoys two fundamental properties: internalization and realizability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Basic epistemic logic with justification</head><p>We introduce the basic epistemic logic with justifications, S4LP, consisting of S4 as the 'knowledge component' and LP as the 'justification component' together with the principle t : F → 2F connecting justification with knowledge. DEFINITION 4.1 Proof polynomials for S4LP are the same as proof polynomials for LP, i.e. they are terms built from variables x, y, z, . . . and constants a, b, c, . . . by means of three operations, application '•' (binary), sum '+' (binary), and evidence checker '!'

It is easy to show that S4LP is conservative with respect to S4. Conservativity of S4LP with respect to LP is a more subtle matter. Though it looks like LP and S4LP share the same set of justification terms (proof polynomials), S4LP has a much richer system of constants, e.g. coming from applying R2 to axioms of groups III. and IV. These additional constants create an extra expressive power for S4LP. However, we conjecture that S4LP is conservative over LP as well.</p><p>The principle LP4 is redundant, but we keep it listed for convenience. S4LP is closed under substitutions of proof polynomials for proof variables and formulas for sentence variables. S4LP also enjoys the deduction theorem.</p><p>Consider a constant specification CS = {c 1 :A 1 , c 2 :A 2 , . . .} (where each A i is an axiom from I-IV and each c i is a proof constant). By S4LP CS we mean a subsystem of S4LP where R2 is restricted to producing formulas from a given CS only.

To emulate the rule of necessitation one needs to apply constructive necessitation to the unbounded set of theorems of S4LP CS , which requires an unbounded set of constant specifications.</p><p>The following property of S4LP is a generalization of constructive necessitation (Proposition 4.6).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Models</head><p>We work with semantics that uses the idea, which can be traced back to models for LP due to Mkrtychev <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Fitting ([19]</ref>), who introduced an evidence function, which assigned 'admissible evidence' terms to a statement. The statement t:ϕ holds in a given world u iff both of the following conditions are met:</p><p>(1) t is an admissible evidence for ϕ in u;</p><p>(2) ϕ holds in all worlds accessible from u. One more idea came from the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> which adapted Fitting models for modal languages with justification by making an 'evidence accessibility' relation separate from the knowledge accessibility relation, thus semantically distinguishing explicit knowledge from the usual knowledge.</p><p>A frame is a structure (W, R, R e ), where W is a non-empty set of states (possible worlds), R is a binary accessibility relation on W , and R e is a binary evidence accessibility relation on W . For our purposes, the relations R and R e can be taken as reflexive and transitive. R e should contain but not necessarily coincide with R.</p><p>Given a frame (W, R, R e ), a possible evidence function E is a mapping from worlds and justification terms to sets of formulas. We can read F ∈ E(u, t) as 'F is one of the formulas for which t serves as possible evidence in world u'. An evidence function obeys conditions that respect the intended meanings of the operations on justification terms (i.e. proof polynomials).

The above models with singleton W 's are called Mkrtychev models (M-models, for short). Mmodels were introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> under the name of pre-models.

AF-models work for a wide class of systems, including the ones mentioned above (LP, S4LP, and S4LPN).</p><p>Fitting models describe relationships between justification assertions t:ϕ and knowability modality 2 e ϕ. AF-models describe relationships between justification assertions t:ϕ and knowledge of an arbitrary agent who respects evidence, but whose knowledge may go beyond the strictly justified one (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). THEOREM 6.3 For any given constant specification CS, the logic S4LP CS is sound and complete with respect to AF-models that meet CS. PROOF. Soundness is straightforward. S4-axioms and rules hold because an AF-model with respect to the modal language is the usual Kripke model for S4. LP axioms and rules are guaranteed by the properties of the evidence function E. Let us check the connection axiom t:F → 2F . Suppose u t:F and uRv. Then uR e v, since R ⊆ R e , and v F . Hence, u 2F .</p><p>Completeness is established by the standard maximal consistent set construction. First of all, we define the canonical model (W, R, R e , E, ) for S4LP CS . Call a set S of formulas in the language of Case: F is t:X. Let t:X ∈ Γ. Then X ∈ E(Γ, t). By the definition of R e , t:X ∈ ∆ for each ∆ such that ΓR e ∆. Since S4LP CS t:X → X, X ∈ ∆ as well. By the induction hypothesis, ∆ X. By the definition of forcing at node Γ, Γ t:X.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">S4LP CS consistent if for no F 1 , . . . , F n ∈ S, ¬(F 1 ∧ . . . ∧ F n ) is provable in S4LP CS .</formula><p>If Γ t:X, then X ∈ E(Γ, t), hence t:X ∈ Γ, by the definition of E.</p><p>To complete the proof of Theorem 6.3, suppose S4LP CS F . Then {¬F } is a consistent set. Take its maximal consistent extension Γ. Then F ∈ Γ and, by the Truth lemma, Γ F in the canonical model.</p><p>COMMENT 6.5</p><p>The completeness of S4LP with respect to F-models was proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, where the canonical model W , R, E and were chosen as above and R e was defined as R e := R. The completeness proof there was essentially the same as in Theorem 6.3 with the following two minor deviations.</p><p>1. To establish the monotonocity property of E, assume F ∈ E(Γ, t). Then t:F ∈ Γ and 2t:F ∈ Γ by positive introspection in S4LP CS . By the definition of R e as R, 2t:F ∈ ∆ for each ∆ such that ΓR e ∆. By reflexivity, t:F ∈ ∆. Hence, F ∈ E(∆, t).</p><p>2. The case t:X ∈ G in the Truth lemma. By the definition of E, X ∈ E(Γ, t). Take ∆ such that ΓR e ∆, i.e. ΓR∆. By positive introspection, 2t:X ∈ Γ, hence 2t:X ∈ ∆. By reflexivity, t:X ∈ ∆ and X ∈ ∆. By the induction hypothesis, ∆ X. By the definition of forcing, Γ t:X. THEOREM 6.6 For any constant specification CS, S4LPN CS is sound and complete with respect to AF-models with symmetric R e meeting CS.</p><p>PROOF. Let (W, R, R e , E, ) be an AF-model from the formulation of the theorem. By the definitions, R ⊆ R e , R is reflexive and transitive, whereas R e is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, i.e. R e is an equivalence relation on W that extends R.</p><p>The soundness portion can be established by a straightforward induction on derivations in S4LPN CS . All the cases but C2 follow from AF-soundness of S4LP, cf. Theorem 6.3. Let us check C2. Suppose u ¬t:F , and pick v such that uRv. Suppose v ¬t:F , i.e. v t:F . Since vR e u, by Lemma 6.2, u t:F -a contradiction. Actually, we have established the stability property of AF-models of the above kind: each formula t:F either holds at all worlds of a given equivalence class with respect to R e , or it does not hold at all worlds of this class.</p><p>The completeness portion is again proven by the maximal consistent sets construction. Define the canonical model for S4LPN CS . Let W be the collection of all maximal consistent sets with respect to S4LPN CS . As before, Γ = {2F | 2F ∈ Γ} and Γ = {t:F | t:F ∈ Γ}. Define R, R e , and E by PROOF. Induction on F . The base case is given by the definitions and the cases of Boolean connectives are standard. Case: F is 2X is treated similarly to Lemma 6.4. Case: F is t:X.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ΓR∆ iff Γ ⊆ ∆ , ΓR e ∆ iff Γ = ∆ ,</formula><p>If t:X ∈ Γ, then X ∈ E(Γ, t). Let ΓR e ∆. By the definition of R e , t:X ∈ ∆. Since S4LPN CS t: X → X, X ∈ ∆. So, by the induction hypothesis, ∆ X. By the definitions, Γ t:X.</p><p>If Γ t:X, then X ∈ E(Γ, t), hence t:X ∈ Γ, by the definition of E.</p><p>A standard argument concludes the proof of the theorem. Suppose S4LPN CS F . Then the set {¬F } is consistent and let Γ be its maximal consistent extension. Then F ∈ Γ and, by Lemma 6.7, Γ F .</p><p>The following stronger form of the completeness theorem holds: THEOREM 6.8 For each F such that S4LPN CS F , there is an AF-model M that meets the constant specification CS such that the evidence accessibility relation in M is total, and F is false in M .</p><p>PROOF. Take the canonical model for S4LPN CS and a world Γ 0 such that Γ 0 F . Consider the equivalence class W with respect to R e such that Γ 0 ∈ W . Since R ⊆ R e , W is closed under accessibility relation R: if Γ ∈ W and ΓR∆, then ∆ ∈ W . Let R, R e , E, and be R, R e , E, and restricted to W , respectively. The resulting structure is an AF-model</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">M = ( W , R, R e , E, )</formula><p>with the evidence accessibility relation R e total on its domain W . Indeed, we have already checked that ( W , R, R e ) is an AF-frame. The properties of the evidence function E are nothing but the special cases of the corresponding properties for E. Furthermore, for each formula X and each Γ ∈ W ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Γ X iff Γ X ,</formula><p>since W is closed with respect to both R and R e . Since Γ 0 F , Γ 0 F as well. This concludes the proof of Theorem 6.8.</p></div>

W is the collection of all maximal consistent sets. Define Γ as {2F | 2F ∈ Γ} and Γ as {t : F | t : F ∈ Γ}. The accessibility relation R, the evidence accessibility relation R e , and the evidence function E are defined by ΓR∆ iff Γ ⊆ ∆ , Obviously, R e extends R. Indeed, let ΓR∆ and t:F ∈ Γ hold. Then 2t:F ∈ Γ, since S4LP CS t: F → 2t:F . By ΓR∆, we conclude that 2t:F ∈ ∆. Since S4LP CS 2t:F → t:F , t:F ∈ ∆ as well. So, R ⊆ R e . Hence, (W, R, R e ) is an S4LP-frame. Let us check the evidence function properties. Monotonicity: F ∈ E(Γ, t) yields t:F ∈ Γ. If ΓR e ∆, then t:F ∈ ∆, by the definition of R e . By the definition of E, F ∈ E(∆, t). Application:F → G ∈ E(Γ, s) and F ∈ E(G, t) implies s:(F → G) ∈ Γ and t:F ∈ Γ. Since s:(F → G) → (t:F → (s•t):G) ∈ Γand Γ is closed under modus ponens (as a maximal consistent set of formulas), (s•t):G ∈ Γ. Hence, G ∈ E(u, s•t). A similar argument proves inspection and sum. Finally, for each propositional letter p, we define the forcing relation for sentence variables by PROOF. Induction on F . The base case is given by the definitions and the cases of Boolean connectives are standard. Case: F is 2X. If 2X ∈ Γ, then 2X ∈ ∆ for each ∆ such that ΓR∆. Since S4LP CS 2X → X, X ∈ ∆. By the induction hypothesis, ∆ X, hence, Γ 2X. If 2X ∈ Γ, then Γ ∪ {¬X} is a consistent set. If it were not consistent, then S4LP CS 2Y 1 ∧ 2Y 2 ∧ . . . ∧ 2Y n → X for some 2Y 1 , 2Y 2 , . . . , 2Y n ∈ Γ.
