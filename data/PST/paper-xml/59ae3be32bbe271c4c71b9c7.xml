<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Beamforming techniques are proposed for a joint multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) radar-communication (Rad-Com) system, where a single device acts both as a radar and a communication base station (BS) by simultaneously communicating with downlink users and detecting radar targets. Two operational options are considered, where we first split the antennas into two groups, one for radar and the other for communication. Under this deployment, the radar signal is designed to fall into the null-space of the downlink channel. The communication beamformer is optimized such that the beampattern obtained matches the radar's beampattern while satisfying the communication performance requirements. To reduce the optimizations' constraints, we consider a second operational option, where all the antennas transmit a joint waveform that is shared by both radar and communications. In this case, we formulate an appropriate probing beampattern, while guaranteeing the performance of the downlink communications. By incorporating the SINR constraints into objective functions as penalty terms, we further simplify the original beamforming designs to weighted optimizations, and solve them by efficient manifold algorithms. Numerical results show that the shared deployment outperforms the separated case significantly, and the proposed weighted optimizations achieve a similar performance to the original optimizations, despite their significantly lower computational complexity.</p></div>

While policy and regulations may delay the practical application of such solutions, research efforts are well under way to address the practical implementation of communication and radar spectrum sharing (CRSS). Existing contributions on CRSS mainly focus on two aspects: 1) co-existence of existing radar and communication devices and 2) co-design for dualfunctional systems. Below we review the related literature in both cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Co-existence of Radar and Communications Systems</head><p>As a straightforward way to support the co-existence, opportunistic spectrum sharing between rotating radar and cellular systems has been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, where the communication system transmits its signals, when the space and frequency spectra are not occupied by radar. While such a scheme seems easy to realize, it does not allow the radar and communication to work simultaneously. Recognizing this fact, the pioneering work of Sodagari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposes a null-space projection (NSP) method to support the co-existence of MIMO radar and BS, in which a MIMO radar beamformer is designed to project the radar signals onto the null-space of the interference channels between the radar and BS, thus zero-forcing the interference imposing on the communication link. However, such a beamformer may result in performance loss for the radar. Further contributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> investigate different tradeoffs between the performance of radar and communications by relaxing the zero-forcing precoder as the projection matrix generated by the singular vectors, whose singular values are less than certain thresholds, and therefore imposes controllable interference levels on the communication systems.</p><p>Recent treatises <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> have employed sophisticated optimization techniques to solve the problem. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the radar beamformer and communication covariance matrix are jointly designed to maximize the radar's SINR subject to specific capacity and power constraints. Similar work has been done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for the co-existence between the MIMO matrix completion (MIMO-MC) radar and point-to-point (P2P) MIMO communications, where the radar sub-sampling matrix is further introduced as a variable in the optimizations. To address the co-existence of MIMO radar and multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) communications, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> considers the issues of robust beamforming design for the BS with imperfect channel state information (CSI), where the radar detection probability is maximized subject to satisfying the SINR requirements of downlink users and the power budget of the BS. As a further step, a novel CRSS beamforming optimization is proposed by Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> by exploiting the multi-user interference (MUI) as a useful source of transmission power, which leads to significant power-saving compared to the conventional methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Co-design of Dual-functional RadCom Systems</head><p>It is worth noting that for supporting co-existence, radar and communication devices are typically required to exchange side-information for achieving a beneficial cooperation, such as the CSI, radar probing waveforms, communication modulation format and frame structure. For instance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the authors assume that an all-in-one control center is connected to both systems via a wireless link or a backhaul channel, which coordinates the cooperation. In practical scenarios, however, such a control center imposes extra complexity on the system, and is also a challenge to implement. In contrast to the conventional License Shared Access (LSA) based spectrum sharing schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a more favorable approach for CRSS is to design a novel dual-functional system supporting both radar and communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, where the above problem does not exist. Note that such methods are distinctly different from the classic LSA techniques, as they require the use of specific radar constraints and designs.</p><p>Aiming for finding the fundamental performance bounds of a joint RadCom system, an information theoretical framework has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> to unify radar and communications with the help of rate distortion theory. Similar efforts have been made by Guerci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, where the concept of radar information rate has been defined for ensuring that the performance of the two functions can be discussed under similar metrics. In addition, waveform design is also considered as an enabling solution. Unlike the passive radar system, where the signals from cellular and television stations are used by a radar receiver to perform target detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the dual-functional waveform is designed for supporting simultaneous cellular communication and target detection on a single platform. Existing contributions on single-antenna systems study the feasibility of time-division (TD) waveforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the combination of the communication symbols with the chirp carrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and the use of orthogonal frequency division modulated (OFDM) waveforms for radar detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. More recently, waveform design considered for MIMO systems has drawn much attention from researchers, where the information bits are modulated by controlling the sidelobe levels of the transmit beampattern of the MIMO radar <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, or by Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation via waveform diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. It should be highlighted that in the above MIMO schemes, each communication symbol is typically represented by one or several radar pulses, which unfortunately leads to a low date rate on the order of the radar pulse repetition frequency (PRF), e.g. kbits per second.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Contribution of Our Work</head><p>In this paper, we develop a series of optimization-based transmit beamforming approaches for a joint MIMO RadCom system, which is defined as a dual-functional platform that can simultaneously transmit probing signals to radar targets and serve multiple downlink users. Such a system realizes both functions within the same frequency band, with significant practical applications. Unlike the conventional joint MIMO waveform design approaches using sidelobe control or waveform diversity, the proposed methods focus on spatial signal processing by considering the beamforming matrices rather than the waveforms. Such a design will not affect the original modulation scheme of the communication. Hence, the data rate remains unchanged. We note that for such systems, the designs of the radar receiver as well as of the uplink communications are also challenging problems. Moreover, the mixed spatial-temporal processing is expected to achieve an improved performance. Due to the limited space, and following the approaches of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, we only focus our attention on the joint transmission of the RadCom system in this paper, and set aside the receiver designs as well as the temporal techniques for our future work.</p><p>Inspired by the NSP method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we firstly consider a separated antenna deployment, where the antennas are partitioned into radar and communication antennas. The interference imposed by the radar signals on the users are eliminated by zero-forcing, and the communication covariance matrix is designed to formulate an appropriate beampattern that matches the radar beampattern, while satisfying the communication performance requirements. The zero-forcing beamforming problem is non-convex, but can be solved by the classic semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique.</p><p>To alleviate the optimization constraints imposed by the above mentioned separated design, we further propose a shared deployment, where all the antennas are shared for both radar detection and downlink communications. This implies that the communication signals are also used as radar probing waveforms. Aiming for designing an appropriate radar beampattern, while satisfying the downlink power and SINR constraints, a non-convex joint optimization problem is formulated, which can be also solved via SDR.</p><p>To further simplify the problem, we design the corresponding weighted optimizations by incorporating SINR constraints as penalty terms in the objective functions. We consider a pair of different penalty terms as well as two power constraints, i.e. the sum-squared SINR error penalty, the max SINR penalty, the total power constraint and the per-antenna power constraint. By doing so, the feasible regions of the weighted problems are viewed as Riemannian manifolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and therefore can be solved by manifold optimization algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. It has been shown that these algorithms are more computationally efficient for the non-convex precoding optimizations with equality constraints than conventional methods, and yield nearoptimal solutions without approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Recent treatises also investigate the application of such algorithms on control theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, where a fast convergence rate can be achieved. Finally, the computational complexities of the proposed algorithms are analyzed in terms of floating-point operations (flops). For clarity, we list the contributions of this paper as follows:</p><p>• We propose both separated and shared antenna deployments for the joint RadCom system, and consider the corresponding beamforming design problems. • We design a number of weighted beamforming optimizations for the shared antenna deployment in conjunction with different constraints and penalty terms. • We reformulate the weighted optimization problems as manifold optimizations, which achieve an identical performance to that of the original optimization by using low-complexity manifold solvers. • We derive the computational complexity analytically in terms of the number of the flops when using the proposed algorithm to solve weighted optimizations. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows, Section II introduces the system model, Section III formulates the optimization problems, Section IV solves the beamforming problems using manifold based algorithms, Section V analyzes the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms, Section VI provides numerical results, and Section VII concludes the paper.</p><p>Notations: Unless otherwise specified, matrices are denoted by bold uppercase letters (i.e., H), bold lowercase letters are used for vectors (i.e., α α α), scalars are denoted by normal font (i.e., γ i ), subscripts indicate the columns of a matrix (i.e., h i is the i-th column of H), tr (•) stands for the trace of the argument, (•) T , (•) * and (•) H stand for transpose, complex conjugate and Hermitian transpose respectively, Re(•) denotes the real part of the argument, diag(•) stands for the vector composed by the diagonal entries of a matrix, ddiag(•) sets all off-diagonal entries of a matrix to zero, • and • F denote the l 2 norm and the Frobenius norm respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>We consider a joint MIMO RadCom system, which can simultaneously transmit probing signals to the targets located at the angles of interest and communication symbols to downlink users. The joint system is equipped with a uniform linear array (ULA) of N antennas, serving K single-antenna users in the downlink while detecting targets at the same time. Below we present the signal models for the pair of operations considered in this paper, namely the separated deployment and the shared deployment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Separated Deployment</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (a), the separated deployment involves splitting the antenna array into two groups: one for radar and one for the downlink communications.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Shared Deployment</head><p>In this case, all the N antennas are shared for both radar detection and downlink communication.

We make the following assumptions:</p><p>1) The RadCom system employs the communication signal as the radar probing waveform; 2) As above, the channel H between the RadCom system and the users is Rayleigh flat fading and it is also perfectly estimated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>In the proposed scenario, an appropriate beamformer has to be designed to meet the following requirements:</p><p>• To generate a close match to the desired beampattern for radar detection; • To guarantee the SINR level required for the downlink users; • To satisfy the transmit power budget. In this section, we first recall the beampattern designs for the colocated MIMO radar only, and then combine them with communication constraints for ensuring that the beamformer obtained can indeed meet the above criteria. We note that, as the radar find its way into more commercial applications, the low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) property becomes more important for the waveform design, potentially enabling the use of low-cost non-linear amplifiers. Nevertheless, we will not include this as a metric in our beamforming designs, as our approach is not a symbol-level/waveform-level optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.

The existing literature indicates that the design of such a beampattern is equivalent to designing the covariance matrix of the probing signals, where convex optimization can be employed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, a constrained least-square problem is formulated to approach an ideal beampattern.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Beamforming for Shared Deployment</head><p>Although the separated deployment allows flexibility in the design of the radar signal, the need for cancelling its interference inflicted upon the downlink users imposes extra constraints in the radar beampattern design problems, which may result in poor performance. One may also trade-off the radar interference received by users by changing the strict zero-forcing equality constraints to inequalities. However, there are still extra constraints in such problems.</p><p>By using the shared deployment, the radar's targets of interest can be viewed as virtual downlink users located in a lineof-sight (LoS) channel. The beamforming design thus becomes a power sharing problem between the virtual users in the LoS channel and the real users in the fading channel. The difference is that we meet the requirements of the former by using a specific beampattern, and that of the latter by enforcing their SINR constraints. Therefore, the optimization for the shared deployment is to firstly formulate a radar beampattern by solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> with N t = N , then substitute the covariance matrix obtained in the communication beamforming problem, which is</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">min Ti K i=1 T i -R 2 2 F (20a) s.t. γ i ≥ Γ i , ∀i,<label>(20b) diag</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_31">K i=1 T i = P 0 1 N ,<label>(20c)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">T i 0, T i = T H i , rank (T i ) = 1, ∀i,<label>(20d)</label></formula><p>where R 2 is obtained by solving ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">9</ref>) or (10), P 2 and γ i are defined as ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">7</ref>) respectively. Note that the SINR γ i for the i-th user in this case is different from β i for the separated deployment above, and that in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, all the transmit power is exploited in the above optimization. Here we also employ the equality constraint (20c) for the power budget, since the radar is often required to transmit at the maximum available power in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>For problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, the following observations can be made: Observation 1: While the problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">20</ref>) is expected to facilitate a better performance for the system, its dimension is larger than that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, which results in higher computational costs.</p><p>Observation 2: Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, the problem (20) can be relaxed as SDP by omitting the rank-1 constraints.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Preliminaries on Riemannian Manifold Optimization</head><p>First, let us briefly commence by revisiting the essential concepts of the Riemannian manifold <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> that will be useful for the derivation of our algorithms. A manifold S is a set of points endowed with a locally Euclidean structure near each point. More precisely, each point of an N-dimensional manifold has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension N <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Given a point p on S, a tangent vector at p is defined as the vector that is tangential to any smooth curves on S through p. As can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the set of all such vectors at p forms the tangent space, denoted by T p S, which is a Euclidean space.</p><p>If the tangent spaces of a manifold are equipped with a smoothly varying inner product, the manifold is a Riemannian manifold. Accordingly, the associated inner procuct is called a Riemannian metric. For instance, R N is a Riemannian manifold with the normal vector inner product being the Riemannian metric. It leads to the existence of rich geometric structures on the manifold, namely geodesic distances, curvatures, and gradients of functions.</p><p>Given a smooth function defined on S, denoted by f (p), the Riemannian gradient is defined as the tangent vector belonging to T p S that indicates the steepest ascent direction of f (p). In particular, if S is a Riemannian submanifold of a Euclidean space, the Riemannian gradient can be computed as the orthogonal projection of the conventional Euclidean gradient ∇ f (p) onto the tangent space, where f is a smooth function defined on the Euclidean space with f being its restriction on S. This is given as <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> grad</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">f (p) = Proj p ∇ f (p) . (<label>28</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_44">)</formula><p>For simplicity, we will not distinguish between f and f in the rest of this paper.</p><p>To find the minimum of f , a descent direction is computed based on the Riemannian gradient. For the Riemannian steepest descent (RSD) algorithm, the descent direction is chosen as the negative counterpart of the Riemannian gradient. For the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm, the descent direction is chosen as a nonlinear combination of the Riemannian gradient of the current iteration and the descent direction of the previous iteration. It is important to note that all the descent directions departing from the point p should belong to the corresponding tangent space T p M.</p><p>Once a descent direction is given, the update point for the i</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">T i i i T i i T T i T T T T T T i T T f grad f 1 Proj i i i P T Π i i T i Π i i G Π +1 i T +1 i T i i T T i T i Proj i T i T i Fig. 2.

Based on the above concepts, below we derive the weighted optimizations related to the original problems of Section III. We will firstly relax the per-antenna power constraint into a total power constraint, i.e. to replace the diagonal constraint with the norm constraint, which is easier to handle by mapping the feasible region onto a hypersphere. This is expected to yield a better solution according to our numerical results. Then we deal with the per-antenna power constraint by solving the problem on an oblique manifold.</p></div>

In contrast to the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, there is no rank-1 constraint in the above optimization, where the power constraint is the only constraint.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we study the computational complexity of using the RCG algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problems in terms of flops. We note that since there are no closed-form complexity expressions for the SDR algorithms, we cannot analytically compare the two families. Hence a simulation based comparison is presented in the numerical results, which highlights the complexity savings of the RCG algorithms.</p><p>Following the concept of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, a flop is defined as one addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of two floatingpoint numbers. With this definition, one complex addition and one complex multiplication can be viewed as 2 and 6 flops, respectively. One addition between two M ×N complex matrices includes 2M N flops, and one multiplication between a M ×N and a N × P complex matrix needs 8M N P flops. Since the number of iterations is difficult to predict, we consider the complexity per iteration, and study the convergence of the algorithms in terms of iterations numerically in our results. In all the computations, we only consider the highest-order terms and omit the low-order ones. For clarity, we list the complexity per iteration for both algorithms in TABLE I by each operation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Complexity of Beamforming Problems under Total Power Constraint</head><p>We first consider the complexity of solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. For the retraction of line 3 in Algorithm 2, which is computed by (48), the total number of flops needed is 14N K. For line 4, the costs of computing the Euclidean and Riemannian gradient using <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_58">39</ref>) are 23N 2 K + 12N K 2 and 12N K flops. The vector transport (49) and the inner product (47) need 12N K and 8N K flops, respectively. Hence, the costs for line 4 are 23N 2 K + 12N K 2 + 42N K flops. For line 5, the costs are 16N K flops, which lead to a total of 23N 2 K + 12N K 2 flops for each iteration.</p><p>For problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, we employ the log-sum-exp approximation, and therefore the only difference w.r.t. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> is to compute the Euclidean gradient. Here we take the exponential of a floating-point number as an operation imposing a constant number of flops, which leads to the same order of complexity as a simple addition or multiplication. Hence, by omitting the lower-order terms, the costs for computing the gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref> are the same as those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, which means that the total costs for solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> are also 23N 2 K +12N K 2 flops per iteration.</p></div>

Complexity of Beamforming Problems under Per-Antenna Power Constraint</head><p>For solving (56) and (57), the costs of retraction (62) are also 14N K flops. The costs for Euclidean gradients are the same as those of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_53">35</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, respectively. Noting that the operators ddiag (XY) and tr (XY) involve a complexity of the same order, the costs needed for computing the corresponding Riemannian gradient, the vector transport and the inner product are the same as those of the optimizations under total power constrains.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, numerical results based on Monte Carlo simulations are provided for validating the efficiency of the proposed beamforming approaches. In all the simulations, we set P 0 = 20dBm, N = 20, N 0 = 0dBm, and employ a ULA with half-wavelength spacing between adjacent antennas. We also assume that each entry of the channel matrix H obeys the i.i.d. standard complex Gaussian distribution. We solve the constrained beamforming optimizations of Section III-B and C by the classic SDR technique using the CVX toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and the penalty problems of Section IV-B and C by the RCG algorithm. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we denote the beampatterns obtained for radar and RadCom joint transmission by 'Radar-Only' and 'RadCom', respectively. In the rest of the figures, where the performance of different beamforming methods is compared for the shared deployment, we use 'Constrainted' to denote the constrained optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, 'RCG' and 'SDR' for the algorithm that is employed, i.e. the Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation, 'Total' and 'Per-Ant' for the total power constraint and per-antenna power constraint, 'Max' and 'Sum-Squ' for the max SINR and sum-square SINR penalty terms used in the weighted optimizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Comparison between the Separated and Shared Deployments</head><p>In order to evaluate the performance of the two proposed antenna deployments, we compare the beampatterns obtained by the zero-forcing beamforming and by the shared beamforming. <ref type="bibr">Fig 3 (a)</ref> and (b) show the beampatterns with multi-beams, which are originally obtained by solving the problems of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">9</ref>) for the radar-only beamforming, and are then formulated by solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> for the two RadCom cases, respectively. The locations of the 5 beams are [-60 • , -36 • , 0 • , 36 • , 60 • ]. The total transmit power, the required SINR for each user and the number of users are set as Γ = 10dB, K = 4. For the separated deployment, we set N R = 14, N C = 6, P R = P C = P 0 /2. It can be seen that the separated deployment provides a poor beampattern with low peaks at each beam owing to its lower DoF, while the shared deployment achieves a far better one, with even higher peaks than the radar-only beampattern. In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> (a) and (b), we investigate the performance of the two deployments in the case of their 3dB beampattern formulations, which are originally obtained by solving problems ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">13</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> for radar only and are then formulated by solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> for the RadCom cases, where the main-beam is centered at 0 • with a 3dB width of 10 • . All other parameters remain the same as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Note that the zero-forcing beamforming formulates a RadCom beampattern with a peak-sidelobe-ratio (PSLR) of 7dB, while the shared beamforming achieves a PSLR of 15dB. We note that in practice an improved PSLR performance can be obtained compared to both results, by employing a more advanced radar beamforming design than the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. It is intuitive that our proposed solutions would approach any given radar-only beampattern to provide arbitrary PSLR. However, to avoid digression from our focus on joint beamforming design, we exploit the classic approach (10) as our radar-only reference beampattern design for simplicity.</p><p>We also show in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> the trade-off between PSLR and SINR for the resultant 3dB beampattern designs of the two deployments, where other parameters are the same as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Once again, we see that for a fixed SINR level, the shared deployment outperforms the separated case leading to a substantial 8dB gain in PSLR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Feasibility Comparison between Constrained Problems and Penalty Problems</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, we show the feasibility probability of the constrained problems and weighted problems with K ranging from 17 to 20, where Γ = 10dB. Note that the feasibility probability of the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> decreases with the increase of the number of users due to the reduction of DoFs. For the case that the number of users equals to the number of the BS antennas, the feasibility probability is less than 5%. For the zero-forcing beamforming of the separated deployment, the optimization is generally infeasible for large numbers of users. Nevertheless, all the weighted optimizations are always feasible, since they are unconstrained problems on the manifolds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performance of Beamforming Methods for Shared Deployment</head><p>Figures 7 and 8 investigate the performance trade-off between radar and communications for different beamforming methods with the shared deployment. In both figures, an original 3dB beampattern of the same shape as in Fig. <ref type="figure">4 (b</ref>) is generated, while SDR and RCG algorithms are used to solve the corresponding constrained and weighted optimizations. We fix the number of users at = 10, and represent the beamforming approaches under total power and per-antenna power constraints by solid and dashed lines, respectively. The weighting vectors of the different weighted optimizations are given in TABLE II. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> presents the trade-off between the PSLR of the RadCom beampattern and the average SINR of the downlink users. Based on this two observations can be     made: 1) As expected, the beamforming methods under total power constraints outperform the methods that employ perantenna power constraints with a 1.7dB SINR gain; 2) The weighted optimizations achieve nearly the same performance as the constrained optimizations, which indicates that the performance loss of penalty problems against the constrained problems is negligible. In Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, the trade-offs between the mean squared error (MSE) of beampatterns and the average downlink SINR are characterized. Here the squared error is defined as M m=1</p><p>(P radar (θ m ) -P RadCom (θ m )) 2 , where P radar (θ m )</p><p>and P RadCom (θ m ) denote the beampatterns for radar-only and RadCom cases, respectively. Unsurprisingly, we see the similar trends to those in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. It is also worth noting that for beamforming methods under total power constraints, the weighted optimization with the max SINR penalty term performs even better than the constrained optimization. We further note that, in contrast to the constrained optimizations, the SINR obtained for weighted optimizations is not explicitly constrained. To evaluate the impact of this, in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> we look at the probability distribution of the instantaneous SINR based on the actual transmitted symbols for the different methods in conjunction with K = 4 and Γ = 18dB. The weighting vectors of TABLE III are employed for achieving the target SINR. It can be observed that the instantaneous SIN-R ranges from 14dB to 22dB for both constrained and weighted optimizations. This highlights that even under explicit SINR constraints, which impose an average SINR threshold, the instantaneous SINR obtained may indeed vary. Still, it can be seen that although the overall variation in the SINR obtained is similar for both weighted and constrained optimizations, and that the sum-square SINR penalty problem associated with the total power constraint achieves the equivalent variance of the corresponding constrained version, the distributions of the constrained optimizations are in general closer to the mean value than for the weighted optimizations. Nevertheless, we will show in the following that this variation is affordable in the light of the significant reduction of the computational complexity.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Computational Complexity</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref>, we explore the convergence speed of the manifold algorithms. We compare the value of cost functions for different weighted optimizations obtained in each iteration in conjunction with K = 6, Γ = 10dB, where two observations can be made: 1) For the optimizations with the same penalty terms, problems associated with total power constraints need fewer iterations to converge to the minimum than those with per-antenna power constraints; 2) For both power constraints, although the max SINR penalty and sum-square SINR penalty problems impose the same computational costs in each iteration, the former has a faster convergence rate, which suggests that the overall complexity of the max penalty problems is less than the problems with sum square penalty terms. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">11</ref>, we further characterize the overall complexity in terms of the average execution time for Γ = 10dB, since it is difficult to specify the analytic complexity when using the CVX. The simulations are performed on an Intel Core i7-4790 3.6GHz CPU 32GB RAM computer. The execution time here represents the time needed for solving the opti-</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

It can be seen that all the weighted optimizations require much less time than the corresponding constrained problems, thanks to the lowcomplexity RCG algorithms. Quantitatively, the complexity is reduced to 50% below for the scenarios considered, and the max penalty problem associated with total power constraint has the fastest convergence rate. Similar trends appear in Fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref>, where the trade-off between execution time and the average SINR obtained have been shown for different beamforming methods with the same parameter configurations as in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and 8.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>A novel framework is proposed for the transmit beamforming of the joint RadCom system, where the beamforming schemes are designed to formulate an appropriate radar beampattern, while guaranteeing the SINR and power budget of the communication applications. We have considered both the separated radar and communications deployment, as well as the shared deployment. To further simplify the problem, we have considered weighted optimizations for the shared deployment that include the SINR constraints as the penalty terms in the objective function, which can be efficiently solved by manifold algorithms. Our numerical results show that the shared deployment has the far better performance than the separated deployment in terms of the trade-off between the quality of the beampattern and the downlink SINR. The proposed weighted optimizations obtain a similar performance to the original beamforming design at a much lower complexity, and therefore they offer a favorable performance-complexity trade-off. </p></div>			</div>
