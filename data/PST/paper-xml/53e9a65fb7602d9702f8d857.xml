Marshall McLuhan's famous dictum, "the medium is the message", should alert us to the determining effect any communication medium has upon the messages it can support. As McLuhan <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> illustrated in analyses of print, telegraphy, radio, television and other media, each technology has made possible new messages, new "pattemings of human association". new meanings, new forms of life (and death). Media are not socially or politically neutral. and the designers and engineers of a new medium bear responsibility for the way it changes the social world. For McLuhan, the "electronic age" demanded new languages and concepts with which to articulate and confront the problems that its media present.</p><p>Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material is granted provided that the copies are not made or distributed for direct commercial advantage, the ACM copyright notice and the title of the publication and its date appear, and notice is given that copying is by permission of the Association for Computing Machinery.

Cosmos,1 an interdisciplinary research project in the U.K. funded under the Alvey programme for advanced information technology, is developing the specification for an advanced CBMS which recognises this potential variety.</p><p>Cosmos is designed to support historically changing communicative practices.</p><p>The concept of a practice is inherently social and historical; it cannot be reduced to a set of individuals together with their respective beliefs, habits. desires, etc., nor can it be removed from historical context. However, just as in linguistics it is possible, for the purposes of analysis, to identify abstract grammatical structures corresponding to relatively stable pattems of usage (e.g. 'sentence', 'noun phrase'). so can we identify forms of communicative practices (e.g. 'committee', 'voting by secret ballot'). Such abstract forms of communicative practice are referred to in Cosmos as Communication Structures (CSS). and they include all the familiar kinds of applications of CBMSs (bulletin boards, computer conferences etc.) some of the less familiar ones (remote tutoring, various group working support facilities) and still others yet to be thought of.</p><p>The functionality of a Cosmos system will be determined by the CSS represented in it. As it has to allow for change in the practices it supports, it must provide users with some instrument for modifying or augmenting its CSS in new ways. The most powerful solution would be a means of producing, for any CS, an interpretable description which uniquely specifies it. Cosmos provides this in the form of SDL, a structure definition language. which is made available to all users, and whose well-formed expressions are the structure definitions.</p><p>In the first part of this paper, we address the specific properties of CMC as a form of communication and in particular we assess and develop the "language/action perspective" on CSCW [4], drawing on work in speech act theory <ref type="bibr">[5, 61 and, especially</ref>, conversation analysis e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. In the second part, we show how these considerations have influenced the design and intended 'COnfigurable</p><p>Structured Message Oriented System interpretation of SDL. By providing both a theoretical perspective and a formal language we hope to help users and designers to articulate and confront some of the problems presented by CBMSs in the CSCW context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">LANGUAGE AS ACTION 2.1 Speech Act Theory and Conversations for Action: A Critical Discussion</head><p>Much recent theoretical work in CSCW has been influenced by speech act theory [4, 8. 9. lo]. The central insight of speech act theory is easily summarised: to speak is ro do. That is. speaking (and by extension all forms of communication) are species of action. This thesis is largely due to J. L. Austin <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> who was concerned to draw attention to sentences such as: I bet you six pence it will rain tomorrow. I declare war on Zanzibar. I dub thee Sir Walter.</p><p>According to Austin, these sentences are not being used declaratively to describe states of affairs in the world, rather they are being used to do things. Said by the appropriate person at the right time. the world will be changed by such sentences in substantial ways. Acts like dubbing, requesting, promising, asserting, expressing etc., which are performed in speech, Austin called illocutionary acts. Since Austin, the development of speech act theory has largely been associated with Searle [6. 111. Searle has been at pains to formalise the notions introduced by Austin, to classify the conditions under which different kinds of speech act can be appropriately ("felicitously") issued, and to explicate a typology of illocutionary acts. It is Searle's work which has proved particularly influential in CSCW.</p><p>The original contribution made to speech act theory by <ref type="bibr">Winograd</ref> and Flores 14. 9]goes beyond a consideration of isolated utterances and addresses the orders of illocutionary acts found in conversational structures. It is these larger structures which they see as comprising an important part of cooperative work. In the form of a transition network, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the orders of acts that Winograd and Flores regard as appropriate for a kind of conversation they claim is central to cooperative work, conversations for action or CfAs. In a simple conversation for action. one party (A) makes a request to another (B). The request is interpreted by each party as having certain conditions of satisfaction. which characterize a future course of actions by B. After the initial utterance (the request), B can accept (and thereby commit to satisfy the conditions); reject (and thereby end the conversation); or counter-offer with alternative conditions. Each of these in turn has its own possible continuations (e.g., after a counteroffer. A can accept, reject, or counter-offer again)...... This diagram is not a model of the mental state of a speaker or hearer, but shows the conversation as a 'dance', in which the acts generate the structure of completion of the conversation. This extension of speech act theory into conversation is of interest both theoretically (it implicitly makes a number of claims about the nature of conversation) and in terms of advanced CBMSs (networks like Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> underlie the design of COORDINATOR. the commercially available system associated with Flares. and CHAOS, the commitment-handling system developed by DeCindio et al. <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>). Here we detail some criticisms of this work because they are instructive for the general relevance of speech act theory for system design and will set up our developments of the lurguage action perspective for cscw.</p><p>First, it is customary for speech act theorists to suppose that utterances (message-texts) can be mapped onto illocutionary acts in a one-to-one fashion. That is, the issuance of an utterance will count as a request, counter, rejection or whatever. This makes it possible to think of a conversation as a chain of illocutionary acts and legitimates system designs where senders of messages classify their message-texts by selecting a category of act presented, say, on a menu of possible options.</p><p>However, it is questionable whether, in conversations, utterances (message-texts) can be mapped on to illocutionary acts in this simple fashion. As Austin was well aware (but his followers less so), many utterances require uptake for an illocutionary act to be secured. For example, I bet you six pence it will rain tomorrow can scarcely be considered to perform the act of betting unless the addressee responds with some ratification like You're on! Without this signal the illocutionary act has not been accomplished, the bet-offer 'hangs'. Similarly, as Levinson <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> argues, a promise requires uptake for the commitments and expectations associated with promising to be secured. In this conversation, A's initial offer is 'deflected' by B's response. This shows that the lone utterance of 1'11 bring back the book I borrowed from you tomorrow is not sufficient for A to be committed to the future course of action you might expect from, say, Searle's <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> list of felicity conditions for promising. B's response overturns A's initial promise. And the response in turn elicits a Thanks from A which constitutes her acceptance of the offer. As a result of this dialogue, A and B have entered into an agreement in which they understand A to be obliged to return the book at around about the weekend. However, at no stage did A utter I hereby promise you to bring back at the weekend the book I borrowed, nor did B utter I hereby request you to bring back at the weekend the book you borrowed (or anything like it), which would be the standard ways in which A's obligation could have been secured on orthodox speech act theory accounts. It seems more sensitive to claim that, very often in actual conversation, the commitments and reciprocal agreements which speech act theory associates with the issuance of single utterances or message-texts emerge from processes of negotiation and/or disputation between participants -processes which are distributed over several turns <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, one utterance can be used to perform many acts. Consider the first utterance in the following interchange <ref type="bibr">[ 141:</ref> A: Would you like another drink? B: Yes I would, thank you, but make it a small one.</p><p>A's utterance seems to be both a question and an offer, and it is taken up by B in this way.</p><p>Further objections can be lodged against the idea that conversations can be captured as chains of illocutions for other action-oriented aspects of an utterance can also be addressed in conversation. <ref type="bibr">Levinson [14]</ref>  Any of the three responses is quite plausible but none of them addresses the illocutionary act A has performed (stating that it's getting late). Rather, they concern possible perlocutionary aims, intents pursued through speech which are specific to the occasion of utterance and not conventionally tied to utterance forms as illocutionary acts are <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. In much recent work on speech acts the distinction between illocutionary acts and perlocutionary aims and effects is often elided (e.g. Allen <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> who conflates the two when coining the term "illocutionary effects"). The objections outlined so far concern general problems with speech act models of conversation. However, Winograd and Flores' contribution has some other problems which are worth bringing out. Consider the horizontal line of transitions across the top of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. This represents the minimal path through the network leading to successful completion. We can rewrite this path as: Sequences like this, where two speakers issue a related pair of utterances in adjacent turns. are known as adjacency pairs and have been the subject of much research by conversation analysts, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Goffman <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and Coulthard <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> amongst others have claimed that adjacency pairs constitute the fundattental units of conversational organisation. The adjacency pair of which 'request' forms the first part typically has 'compliance' or 'rejection' as the second. It seems odd that Winograd and Flares do not recognise 'compliance' as a legitimate follow-up to a request. Rather, they seem to believe that addressees have to issue a promise to advance the conversation towards completion. However, addressees can proceed straightaway to the requested action if they see fit. Indeed, there is evidence (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for a review) that responses to a request other than compliance are linguistically marked or signaled as unusual or dispreferred. This is not to say it is impossible or illformed to follow-up a request with a promise but rather this sequence should not be given special status over what is preferred in actual conversation, a requestcompliance pair.</p><p>It must be admitted that Winograd makes some qualifications to the CfA network. in one of which he notes that "the actual doing of whatever is needed to meet the conditions of satisfaction lies outside of the conversation structure" [4. ~2071. On this view, perhaps compliance need not be represented in the CfA network, but this underplays the central and important insight of speech act theory. For speech act theorists, speaking should be seen as part of a general theory of action and, indeed, some recent developments in speech act theory have been consistent with this. For example, see the attempts to relate speech acts to context-change in Gazdar <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Why, then, treat compliance aa external to the CfA network? Indeed, we can query the Winograd and Flores term conversations for action and ask why they should distinguish them from conversations for clarification. possibilities and oiientation. If conversations are always already sites for action, why speak of conversations for action? Furthermore, to distinguish these different kinds of conversation is to underestimate how they often intertwine searnlessly. To see this, consider again the CfA network. Its point of entry involves the issuance of a request. However, comparatively rarely in conversation do people issue requests in explicit forms such as I request you to.... or employ an imperative sentence-type. Instead, requests are often brought off through so-called pre-requests.</p><p>A pre-request is an utterance issued by a potential requester which (typically) checks to see if the most likely hindrance to the requestable action exists or not. Pre-requests embed in conversational sequences which have a four turn structure in their full form, as exemplified by the following fragment of conversation between a customer and a sales assistant These two examples illustrate another feature of prerequests: they are often constructed specifically to obtain a requested action immediately rather than a response which requires the subsequent request/response adjacency pair. Both involve pre-requests which contain enough information to specify the kind of action that would subsequently be requested. When feasible, truncated sequences are like!y to be preferred over pre-emptive offers which are, in turn, preferred over full four turn sequences.</p><p>From this discussion of pre-requests. a number of points can be made which are relevant to speech act theory in general and Winograd and Flores' use of it in particular.</p><p>First, requests are often brought off without the explicit issuance of a request at all. Often conversants proceed from a pre-request straightaway to compliance. Thus, what -for Winograd and Flores -is the point of entry to a CfA can be bypassed altogether. Indeed, as the execution of the requested action is not represented in their network, the most preferred way to bring off a request will involve actions none of which are to be found in a CfA! This anomaly is a consequence of treating xequested actions and pre-condition checks as external to the "central fabric" made up of CfA. It must also give us further reasons to doubt whether the structure of request-based sequences is captured by the CfA network.</p><p>It should be noted that speech act theorists have often seen utterances like Can I have two pints of Abbott and 4 grapefruit and a whisky? and Have you got Embassy Gold? as so-called indirect speech acts and have sought mechanisms by which speakers and hearers might derive an underlying direct form from them typically by a p:ocess of inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. On this view, it might seem appropriate to modify the entry conditions on a CfA by allowing indirect requests along with direct forms. However, when we inspect how such forms are used in actual conversation, it seems that they are or become indirect through their position in extended discourse sequences. Compare the two interchanges below: If A's Do you stock Philip Morris? is taken to be an indirect request as sequence (i) suggests it might be. what are we to make of sequence (ii)? Does A issue two requests in this sequence? And thereby initiate two separate CfA? Surely not. This would miss the fact that Do you stock Philip Morris? is a preparatory move in (ii): it lays the way for the third turn request A crush proof pack, please. Alternatively.</p><p>if a speech act theorist were to claim that Do you stock Philip Morris? is an indirect request in (i) but a preparatory question in (ii). all hope for a systematic account of how explicit forms connect with underlying illocutions would have been forfeited. Surely, identical forms cannot be different acts in response to a speech act theorist's say-so.</p><p>To escape from this dilemma. we have to contextualise Do you stock Philip Morris? in the entire strip of talk in which we find it. In particular, we must not neglect what follows next, its uptake. In (i), it meets with Yes dear plus (provides) whereas in (ii). just Yes dear comes in response. In (i), a preferred anticipation of the request is made whereas in (ii). the request has to be made explicit. If we are to retain speech act terminology to describe such states of affairs. we need to say that the illocutionary act of an utterance is indeterminate until we know how it has been taken up.</p><p>If this is correct, illocutionary acts are social accomplishments and not individual performances <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. We need to understand illocutions dialogically.</p><p>as at least in part determined by their uptake. A CBMS in which the senders of messages fix the classification of their turn by selecting from a set of illocutionary options will not respect this. A general point can be made:</p><p>the tendency to see illocutions only monologically in terms of relations between utterance forms, utterer's intentions and the world is endemic to many forms of speech act theory. Perhaps, rather than start with the isolated utterance as our datum, we should consider whole strips of conversation. This is the approach of the conversation analysts, whose work we have already made use of and which we shall develop further below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Local and Global</head><p>Management and the Limits of Prospective Representation We have emphasised uptake in understanding the organisation of conversation. This relates to a general and important feature of conversation:</p><p>it is locally managed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. Many aspects of ordinary face-to-face conversation operate on a turn-by-turn basis with just a single transition organised at a time. As Sacks et al. have shown. the rules which determine turn-taking allocate turns to speakers locally, concerning (typically) only the very next turn. For example, issuing the first pair part of an adjacency pair (a question, say) makes its second (an answer) expectable at the very next turn. If an answer is returned, it fulfils the expectation and retrospectively confirms the appropriateness of the question.</p><p>However, departures from strict adjacency are possible, as exemplified below:</p><p>A: What's the time? (Ql) B: Why do you want-t; know? (42) A: I have a train to catch. (A2) B: It's 5.30 (Al)</p><p>Here, one question-answer pair is embedded in another.</p><p>Schegloff <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> calls such embedded utterances insertion sequences.</p><p>Strict adjacency also breaks down when the second part is not forthcoming. The absence of a second can itself be significant;</p><p>for example, an unanswered question can sometimes be taken as evidence that the intended answerer does not know or does know but would be committing herself to something that she wishes to avoid etc. etc. depending on other factors.</p><p>Phenomena such as the 'notable absence' of second parts and insertion sequences suggest to Schegloff <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> that strict adjacency should be qualified by the notion of conditional relevance. Thus, given a fist part, a second is immediately relevant and predictable, but if it fails to occur. and, say, some other first part occurs in its place, then that will be heard, where possible, as some preliminary to the doing of the second part, the relevance of which is locally maintained on a turn-byturn basis until it is either directly attended to or aborted by the announced failure to provide some preliminary action. If it is not possible to interpret the non-expected response as a preliminary. the responder may fmd herself accountable for specific inferences that her behaviour will have generated [14. ~321. note 161. Schegloffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> distinction between Iocation -i.e. the sequential locus of a turn -and position -its relation to some prior but not necessarily adjacent pair -is useful here. In an adjacency pair with a question-answer sequence inserted between the two parts, the second part still occupies the second position though the insertion sequence entails it being located fourth. Thus, adjacency pairs retain a local management of position even if the first and second parts may be separated.</p><p>A consequence of local management in conversation is that it is hard to sustain any more than locally operating predictions as to how a conversation will proceed. Thus, whether a request takes two turns to bring off or requires a longer sequence depends upon how participants respond to a succession of local considerations regarding the turns available to them at each stage. The localism and situatedness [25, ~73-831 of conversation is somewhat missed by network models of conversation where only certain options are represented at particular junctures as an extended non-locally managed representation unfolds. No matter how exhaustive the network-modeller thinks she has been, other actions can always be executed by participants for reasons which may be highly specific to the particular situation of utterance and relate to the inferences participants are willing to be held accountable for. Indeed, the localism and situatedness of conversation calls into question the utility if not the very possibility of a prospective representation of its structure, even for apparently more 'specialised' conversations like those surrounding requests. We want to assert the re,levance of conversation analysis for understanding the kinds of communication that takes place in group working situations and for its automated support. To show this, we shall attempt two things. First, we shall indicate that the concepts associated with conversation analysis -developed in face-to-face settings -have applicability for the analysis 129 of the asynchronous communication which characterises the most challenging applications of CBMSs in CSCW. Secondly, we shall investigate how far and in what sense group working activities exemplify the localism and situatedness which we claim characterise conversations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Conversation Analysis and Asynchronous</head><p>Computer Mediated Communication Although CBMSs can be employed to communicate in real-time, it is perhaps their use in supporting asynchronous communication which raises the most novel problems. Most conversation analytic work has centred on face-to-face conversation, communication under the "full conditions of co-presence" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. A number of researchers -for various, different reasons -have denied the relevance of this area for asynchronous media or attempted to show significant differences <ref type="bibr">[27.</ref> 281. However, it is our contention that -when understood appropriately -conversation analytic concepts do provide insights into the nature of communication when spatio-temporal co-presence of participants is not demanded.</p><p>Under asynchronous conditions. there are at least three (dis)junctures at which sets of actions synchronised in co-present conversation need not be in CMC. Consider the actions involved in the creation, transmission and receipt of a standard electronic mail message. We identify the following Asyncbronies: Asynchrony 1: between the time of message-creation and the time of transmission. The message-author can go back over the text. amend and append sections etc. before transmitting.</p><p>By contrast, in conversations under co-presence, the creation atid transmission of an utterance me simultaneous processes. Between receipt and future response, other actions of greater, lesser or no relevance to responding can intervene. As we have seen with conversation, the addressee's following actions are conditionally relevant to what has gone before and absences can be significant.'</p><p>The existence of these Asynchronies has doubtless led many researchers to suppose that they make many of the findings of conversation analysis irrelevant to CMC. For example, Hiltz <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> -largely through focussing on Asynchrony 1 and emphasising the freedoms participants enjoy when not competing for the floor -has claimed that turn-taking has little influence on computerconferencing.</p><p>However, a careful examination of the corpora of messages collected by Black et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> and Severinson Ekhmdh [29] should indicate otherwise.</p><p>In her study of "letters" in the COM system, Sever&amp;on Eklundh found many examples of two turn lThere is direct evidence from construct studies carried out in the Cosmos project that participants are aware of the three Asynchronies we have laid out and see them as constitutive of rhe differences between CMC and other forms of communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref>. He seemed positive. David had advertised us well, so he found himself representing the whole banking world. Next meeting will be in Stockholm, I think, and then we shall come up with a lot of expertise. He thinks that we might be interested in an even larger field than information services (He is going to start running COM himself in connection with the implementation of VAX es at our subsidiaries.)</p><p>This is an exemplary question-answer adjacency pair. The question is topicalised by the subject header and followed up by an answer yoked to the same header. Severinson Eklundh found the modal length of asynchronous dialogues with an initial turn containing a question to be two turns, the vast majority of second turns being in answer to the first turn. However, sometimes the basic two-part structure was augmented by a third turn giving feedback. In the above example the sender of the first part followed up with: A: Subject: OSIS meeting in London (TURN 3)</p><p>That's great.</p><p>Severinson Eklundh [29. p43-41 tries to argue that such three-part sequences often constitute the fundamental structural unit or "minimal interaction" in CMC. However, her own data suggest two-part sequences to be empirically more common and three-part sequences may only be the dominant "minimal interaction" when it is thought legitimate for one party to have both the first and the last words (e.g. in teaching settings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[30]</ref>). It seems more appropriate to analyse the OSIS meeting sequence as an adjacency pair in which the second part is not only an answer but also sets a context for a following 'agreement' in an 'assessment/agreement' structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[31]</ref>. This suggests that turns can be multifunctional in that they can contain coexisting 'elements' serving different discursive functions.</p><p>Both time @tats/he has spent on the system. At the logout portion of the system it tells you the amount of time and money spent for that particular entry. what about all my entries taken together. als to use a question mark within a message (im afraid that it will give me all the commands) Levitt: Re: amount of time on system Yes, ? is ok within a message. Anything is ok, except for control D at the beginning of a line.We will get printouts at the end of each week week telling you how much each account spent so far, so check with Bud if you want. jal</p><p>Here Marti poses two questions (one in two different ways) and both are taken up by L.&amp;n in a single reply. Although dialogues of this sort can be found in conversational discourse, multifunctionality is particularly prominent in CMC where participants can autonomously determine exactly how a turn is constructed. Asynchrony 1 allows authors to compress into one turn as many actions requiring response as is desired <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[32]</ref>.</p><p>In the last two examples, several adjacency pairs were compressed into two turns. However, it is possible to find sequences in which a number of questions, say, appear in one turn but they are answered in more than one turn in reply. for example [29. Severinson Eklundh [29. ~531 conjectures that B forgot to reply to A's question concerning who pays and sent a second message (third turn) as an afterthought. However, in CMC, absences and delays do not admit of unambiguous interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[33]</ref> and it is equally possible that, say, B did not know who pays when sending the first reply but, sometime thereafter, checked the details of the meeting before sending the second reply. Of course, this is only one further interpretation amongst many possibilities but it indicates that a user can stagger her responses to turns containing several actions. dealing with each as and when she can.</p><p>The converse is also to be found in Severinson Eklundh's corpus. In the following, in a single reply, actions appearing in more than one prior message are dealt with [29. ~541: A: Subject: DSK:COMPTY.REL&lt;12.345&gt;</p><p>Why has it been removed, but not ATR 7 SIM?

I will recompile.</p><p>Here, A's initial question was supplemented with a second nun statement before B replied by taking A's two turns together in a single multifunctional turn in the third location.</p><p>The last few examples illustrate two discourse phenomena that are comparatively rare (but not nonexistent) in face-to-face conversation: (i) multifunctionality -a turn can contain several actions; (ii) staggering -a multifunctional turn can meet with several turns in reply. or a single multifunctional turn can serve as a reply to several prior turns. These phenomena indicate that turns have a more oblique relation to actions and discourse structuring than in copresent conversation. Indeed, given the data presented and these novel phenomena, one might query whether the concept of an adjacency pair is appropriate to CMC at all. We believe that it is provided that some imPortant qualifications are noted.</p><p>First, we must re-iterate our earlier observation that strict adjacency is too strong and that the first part of an adjacency pair establishes the conditional relevance of whatever it is that serves as a response to it. Indeed, as strict adjacency is not an organising principle of conversation, it is unfair to make out a conversation/CMC difference by demonstrating that strict adjacency does not obtain in CMC, pace <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Secondly, we must not necessarily make the action performed by the issuance of a first or second pair part coextensive with a single turn -a turn (message) can contain a number of first parts or second parts (or other actions) coexisting alongside each other. Such multifunctionality does not seem to be allowed for in conversational networks like the CfA presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>131 Thirdly, because of Asynchronies 1, 2 and 3. between an agent's turn containing a first part action and her receipt of a conditionally relevant response, any number of other turns related to other sequences may be formulated, transmitted and/or received. Thus CMC discourse sequences can complexly intertwine in a way that is not readily possible in co-present conversation, where -typically -only one conversation at a time can be adequately attended to per agent and only one speaker holds the floor at any moment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</p><p>None of this is to say that structuring breaks down in CMC. There are still local constraints on action order. The second parts of adjacency pairs can only follow their firsts. We can still define temporal regions in which a turn containing certain action(s) will be conditionally relevant and expectable.</p><p>Thus, for CMC. we need a concept of the relative temporal precedence of actions. This we shall develop more formally in 3.2.5 below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Group Working as Communication Manifesting</head><p>Local and Global Structuring We have been at pains to emphasise that conversational interactions in CBMSs are locally managed and structured around adjacency pairs. This should indicate the utility of conversation analysis for understanding asynchronous CMC and should underline the importance of respecting the localism of conversation in any CBMS which offers automated support for such interactions.</p><p>However, it must be recognised that not all interaction is conversational.</p><p>According to Sacks et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, conversations, being locally structured, lie at one extreme of a 'dimension' of pre-allocation.</p><p>In conversation, only the turn in the next position is allocated to a speaker and constrained in advance with respect to its expectable content. At the other extreme, lie oiher "speech-exchange systems" in which all (from first to last) turns are pre-allocated. Sacks et al. give the example of a 'ceremony' or 'ritual' as located at or near this extreme. In ceremonies (or at least in typical ones) all turns are pre-allocated. At any given turn, you will know who will be speaking (and, usually for that matter, what they'll be saying). By contrast to Sacks et al.'s local management notion, we can say that such communication activities are subject to global management systems.</p><p>If conversation is a 'pure' example of local structuring and ritual a 'pure' example of global structuring, we believe that many kinds of interaction involve combined localiglobal structuring. Consider speech exchange in a medical encounter, a physician being visited by a patient. Often, such interactions can be analysed into the following episodes: beginning of consultation, patient's narrative, questioning led by the physician, (optionally) physical examination, specifying treatment and (optionally) issuing prescription, leave-taking. An organisation of this sort can be subject to many situated variations but captures the episodic structure of many consultations, especially those with doctors who try to maintain short turn round times. The transitions from episode to episode will usually be determined by the physician and will often be marked by issuing pragmatic particles such as Now . . . . So... or Well... together with making explicit the content of the next episode: Well, I think I ought to examine you, would you mind coming over to the couch? Within episodes. communication is conversation like and locally managed, though typically the physician will control the topicalisation of the talk (at least after the initial narrative) and will sometimes initiate three part structures resembling adjacency pairs but with a follow up comment as third. The episodic structure allows a number of non-local projections concerning the course of future interaction; yet within episodes. local projections may be all that is possible (or relevant for participants).</p><p>(Our discussion here is based on work by amongst others: <ref type="bibr">[34, 35. 36, 371)</ref>. Similar organisational principles -locally managed interactions within a globally structured activity -also characterises communication in many "scripted" situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>. instructional settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[30]</ref> and interviews 1371.</p><p>Local and global structuring also coexist in many group working tasks. As part of the COSMOS project Paul Buckley has analysed transcripts of interviews with the officers of a British local government department, who periodically produce reports which are eventually combined in a document known as an Agenda, which is then presented to a committee of elected councillors [391.</p><p>The process of report production and Agenda compilation is complex and involves several scheduled meetings and often unscheduled ones as well. It is striking how often the informants allude to unscheduled meetings and conversations in their descriptions of their working practices. For example, one officer reveals that weekly scheduled meetings with the Chair can be supplemented by "chats" when necessary. Similarly, locally instigated conversations may come into existence if some matter has not been covered adequately in a scheduled meeting or if there is insufficient time to call another. The content of such meetings is decided locally and situatedly by its participants and tends simply to be about "items that have cropped up".</p><p>Regular scheduled meetings are also often depicted by interviewees as having a discussive or conversational microstructure, though it may be nested within a recurrent form. The content. of such meetings, that is. what topicalises the talk within them, can often be only locally decided even if the meetings have a 'formal' procedure or order of business.</p><p>Even who attends a meeting can be situatedly determined;</p><p>whether an officer attends a particular meeting may depend on what is to be discussed that day, the officer's current priorities etc. Many of the 'roles' or 'responsibilities' of the officers are in reality fluid and negotiable in the light of the specificity of situations that arise.</p><p>The pervasive impression gained from Buckley's transcripts is of a department continually engaged in many local situated negotiations of role, responsibility and work content. However, at the same time, many aspects of the working practices are somewhat more fixed. For example, authors must append a background documents list to their report to permit any reader (including members of the public) to check on the report's sources. This requirement is fixed by statute as are many of the responsibilities of the Council Officers.</p><p>Similarly, the process of report production and Agenda creation takes place within a time schedule which is fixed by the regular occurrence of public Committee Meetings with an order and frequency again fixed in part by statute. Indeed, the imminent occurrence of such a Meeting can affect the extent to which locally negotiated commitments become supplanted by other more formal responsibilities. This is not to say that the existence or structure of Committee Meetings or the nature of people's responsibilities with respect to them are unchangeable or non-negotiable.</p><p>Even legal statutes can be made the subject of discussion and debate and changed accordingly, even if for the most part this possibility may not affect an officer's diurnal conduct. The point is rhat two different kinds of organisation of working practices coexist alongside each other. This is reflected in the nature of the communications which take place in the department and how they unfold over time. Alongside the formal proced,ures associated with certain kinds of meeting, there exists a manifold of unscheduled conversational activity which both determines and is determined by the content and temporal proximity of scheduled meetings.</p><p>To focus exclusively on the scheduled meetings and events associated with them (like deadlines)</p><p>would present an idealised view of the temporal patterning of communication and the nature of responsibiiity.</p><p>Winograd [4] makes a similar point in his discussion of Kaasboll's <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref> work on the activities associated with a hospital ward: we must not ignore conversational activity. But equally. we must not overextend the scope of conversations. Communication also occurs in a form which involves the non-local pattemings of events, in which more distal projections are possible. These two forms can coexist. Accordingly, any approach to group working which attempts to provide automated support for such situations must be tolerant of both the local and global structuring of work and the communication which surrounds and penetrates it. Language SDL has been designed to meet certain requirements many of which emerge from our considerations of CSCW through a conversation analytic development of the language/action perspective. Fundamentally, we see the characterisation of a CS to involve the definition of a set of expectable communicative actions and a set of constraints over their temporal orders and contexts of realisation.</p><p>To define a CS can be thought of as a process of answering two kinds of question: what sorts of actions are there? and when are they expected to occur? Following from our criticism of the more rigidified forms of speech act theory, we want to insist on a dialogical model of communication which emphasises interaction among participants, and not merely the separate 'transmission' and 'reception' of messages between an active Sender and a passive Receiver. As we shall see, this leads us to a particular conceptualisation of the relation between moments of information passing (messages or turns) and the accomplishment of communicative actions. Typically, we see the accomplishment of communicative action as a locally managed affair, even though such (inter)actions may be embedded in more globally structured communication for which a prospective representation can be given in SDL.  An encapsulated action (EA) involves the creation of some object which is typically exchanged on completion. To define an EA requires the specification of the role associated with the creation of the object, the object's name and any other (pre-existing) objects that the new object is created from or based upon. The syntactic form of an EA in SDL is aa follows:5 The order of the role names is significant. The first role is the initiator of the exchange. Initiating an exchange involves sending the object stipulated to the other role(s) who serve(s) as recipient(s).</p><p>The form for an exchange can be expanded to allow the specification of tbe illocutionary act performed in the exchange, together with any other actions or exchangeable entities that are predicted or pre-supposed, thus:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Invitation [for comments] report Author</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interested-others</head><p>Here, sending the report from the 'Author' to the 'Interested-others' is classified as an invitation which renders expectable the future existence of an object (or objects) called 'comments'. This enables SDL users to express some of the dependencies which exist between actions in a CS definition.</p><p>It is in recognition of Asynchrony 1 that we make the distinction between those aspects of communicative action which are relatively encapsulated (i.e. do not require reference to other roles) and those moments where two or more roles become related by means of an exchange occurring (and encapsulation breaking down). Accordingly.</p><p>to permit the representation of these features of the time-course of asynchronous 1 In this presentation of SDL, the 'keywords' of the language and any other stipulated syntactic device that promotes parsability are emboldened. Also, optional parts are placed within curly brackets. In the example and the fragments cited, objects appear italicised. communication, we distinguish between the process of object creation and the moment of exchange.</p><p>Due to the dialogical nature of the accomplishment of speech acts, an exchange need not correspond to just a single moment of information passing, but can be distributed over several turns. Thus, the sending of a report from an Author to a Line Manager may involve a single turn if the report is transmitted in one go, or several turns may be implicated if the report is presented to the Line Manger in sections. These are local considerations about which no stipulations are made in SDL. Similarly, the presence of an exchange from role A to role B in a definition does not rule out the possibility that information can be passed from B to A. Exchanges mark the sites of locally managed interactions which are initiated by the sender of the specified object. They need not stop upon the transmission of the object if participants wish to enter into an extended interaction. In this way, any illocutionary act associated with an exchange is permitted to emerge over the course of several turns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Objects and their Individuation</head><p>An object is any kind of entity which can be created and exchanged. It could be a text-file, a program, a graphics file or some combination or whatever.</p><p>In the REPORT-WRITING-CS.</p><p>we identify the following objects: report comments background-documents_list report7summary rejectron authorisation Many CSS are characterised as having objects which appear in many different versions; for example, a paper before and after revision. For a variety of reasons. it can be convenient to give the same name to a number of different versions of an object. It is important, then, that SDL should have the means to refer to objects both generically (all version of object, 0) and individually (e.g. version n of object, 0). SDL offers two means for achieving this.</p><p>The first way is to use integer indices as subscripts and allow various computational operations be defined on them. This method is familiar from programming languages and algebraic methods. We shall not discuss it further here.</p><p>The second way is to refer to object versions by history. This involves specifying one or more 'contexts of prior appearance' Thus, following the object name, there can appear a list of prior contexts which pick out the object version which is to be referred to. For example, to individuate the 'paper which A sent to B' we can write: paper /paper A Bl Here, the object name 'paper' is modified by reference to its prior appearance in the exchange 'paper A B'. Now, in case there have been several exchanges of the form 'paper A B'. we make the default assumpiion that it is the last of these that is being referred to. However, if, instead, we want to refer to all the papers which have appeared in a 'paper A B' exchange we write: paper.. Ipaper A B/ A number of different SDL concepts can appear modifying an object name. For example, encapsulated acticns can be listed to individuate object versions. Similarly, we can list CS names if we wish to individuate an object version which appeared in another CS, an example of which can be seen in the REPOKT-WRITING-CS in 3.2.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.3</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Roles</head><p>In SDL, roles are the agents and patients of action. without prejudice to what kind of real world entity might correspond to a particular role as identified in an SDL expression; it might correspond to an individual human user, to some kind of collective person, or even an automated process. SDL is neutral with respect to the ontological status of the entities which may become associated with roles. Thus, we use the role concept to drive a wedge between an 'abstract' description of action coordination of the sort expressions in SDL provide and proper-named entities which can be pointed out and individuated in the 'real world'. It provides a way of expressing the actions associated with a CS without reference to actually existing entities which on the occasion of a particular instantiation of a structure might become associated with those roles identified in the CS.</p><p>This approach has a number of consequences. First, there need be no match between the criteria by which roles are individuated in SDL and the criteria by which entities are individuated in the 'real world'. Thus, we might count x roles in an SDL definition without thinking that we should be able to enumerate x entities on any particular occasion of use of the CS. Secondly, on this approach, defining a role is not to be seen as providing a fixed set of responsibilities or any other kind of moral inj.unction. Defining a role falls out of the definition of a structure in SDL and involves associating names with actions. We do not want the departure by any real-world agent from the set of actions associated with their role name to be crudely taken as a ground for praise or blame, for such departures are often made for important and legitimate situated reasons.</p><p>Instantiation of a CS as an 'activity' in a Cosmos system is the process by which roles get associated with proper nmles. However. just as many human individuals may share a user name (e.g. the use of "guest" or "user" on some systems), the process of instantiation need not involve picking out human individuals.</p><p>What it does involve is association of a set of role names with a set of proper names although, as we shall shortly see, it is not the case that all the role names that appear in a structure definition have to be associated with proper names.</p><p>SDL provides two means for defining relations between roles: canplay and allocate. The concept of canplay has been adopted from the work of Tschritzis and Gibbs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref>. As we have understood roles as (merely)</p><p>an assemblage of actions, in SDL X canplay Y should be understood as "the actions *hat are associated with Y become associated with X". That is. for all members of the set of actions involving reference to Y, Y can be substituted with X. Consistent with our general understanding of SDL, it is role names (and not proper names) which stand in the X and Y positions. canplay can be used for a number of purposes in CS definitions. not least of which is to set up a name which can be used to substitute a list of role names which if repeated on each occasion of appearance would make the SDL expressions unwieldy. In general, when canplay is used in this fashion, it will denote those junctures where, on instantiation, facilities will be required akin to distribution lists. cauplay can also be used dynamically within a CS. That is, role relations established by the c anp lay relation can come into existence or be redefined at specifiable moments.</p><p>allocate is used when one role determines which agents should become related to a particular role name.</p><p>Thus, X allocate Y means that X decides which agents become associated with the role name Y. The choice of term 'agent' is deliberate here for role allocation may involve the player of X during run time associating role names or proper names with Y. That is. role allocation may involve an already instantiated role instantiating another by associating a proper name with a role name.</p><p>The important difference between canplay and allocate concerns whether the agents denoted by a particular role name can be determined prospectively (i.e. prior to running an instance of the CS) or whether a particular role player has to make a local situated decision. Thus, in the REPORT-WRITING-CS.</p><p>we find the following two actions:</p><p>Author allocate Interested-others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Invitation [for comments] report Author</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interested-others</head><p>Here, the Author determines who constitute the 'Interested-others' on the basis of local considerations (perhaps related to the content of the paper, who is available, has already expressed an interest or whatever).</p><p>As remarked earlier, not all roles will be associated with proper names at run time. Indeed, we make a distinction between foundational and non-foundational roles in terms of the former and not the latter being those requiring association with proper names during the instantiation process. Formally, we can take those roles which nowhere in the definition appear after canplay as foundational.</p><p>The notion of a foundational role enables us to tell where to look during run time for 'contact with the outside world'. For example, an exchange between two roles will ultimately be resolved so that each of the roles related by means of the exchange are foundational. By definition, this involves the recovery of the proper names of the users or whatever entities are filling the foundational roles in question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Rules and Contextual Conditions</head><p>Exchanges and other actions can be clustered together by means of a rule facility. A rule brings together related actions and ties them to a contextual condition which specifies the circumstances under which they are expected. In this way, a set of rules can represent the episodic organisation of a CS and capture its globally managed aspect.</p><p>Typically, SDL rules have the form of a left hand side (LHS) made up of a rule name and a contextual condition and a right hand side (RHS) which is a list of actions. Broadly speaking, a contextual condition is any statement which can be evaluated as true or false. As such SDL's rules can be thought of as productions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>. In contrast to some realisations of the production rule concept, we allow more than one action to appear on the RHS of a rule. However, RI$Ss are interpreted as unordered sets of actions; i.e. no significance -temporal or otherwise -is attributed to the order in which actions appear. We also allow rule names to appear on the RHS.</p><p>We distinguish between rules which are active and rules which are not (i.e. that are non-active or 'asleep'). Just how a rule becomes active, we shall discuss shortly. Each active rule is tested to see if its contextual condition has turned true. If the contextual condition has turned true, the rule is 'triggered'. When the rule is triggered, the actions on the RHS are expectable. Thus, a production rule system enables us to represent the contexts in which actions become expectable, their actual execution being a matter of local situated determination.</p><p>Typically, a rule is activated when some other rule on the RHS of which its name appears is triggered. An Assume that REPORT-WRITING-SENIOR is active and its condition turns true through the Author evaluating "The Author is a Senior Management Team member" as true. This triggers the RHS. The encapsulated action on the RHS now becomes expectable and in addition the four rules listed are made active. Consider the one of these cited, SUMMARY-FOR-DIRECTOR.</p><p>This has two actions on its RHS, an encapsulated action and an exchange. These are not necessarily expectable yet. That only occurs when that rule's condition becomes true in its turn. i.e. when the Author evaluates "Report requires a summary for the Director" as true.</p><p>This fragment of the REPORT-WRITING-CS exhibits two other properties of SDL which are worth noting. The first concerns the global structuring of communication in report writing as we have characterised it in this CS. We can read the REPORT-WRITING-SENIOR rule as informing us of the global structure of the activity. According to this rule, report writing for a senior author involves creating a report, obtaining comments (on it), revising it (in the light of comments), creating the Director's summary (if necessary) and creating a background documents list. Ultimately, these rules break down into locally managed actions. Secondly, it is worth noting the presence of the evaluate expressions. These allow role players to make local situated decisions regarding the appropriateness of actions which will be triggered if they evaluate the expressions to true. Thus, the truth values of some contextual conditions can be decided by people (if people are filling the designated roles). In a significant sense, some aspects of SDL need not be machine interpretable.</p><p>We insist on this not through an antipathy regarding automation but because of our recognition of the importance of situated knowledge as underlying at least some of the decisions required on particular occasions of use. I -35</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5">Temporal Order Constraints</head><p>We have remarked already that several actions can appear on the RHS cf an SDL rule without prejudice concerning their order of occurrence. This is because SDL makes a strict separation between a rule component and a temporal order component. The rule component contains the set of SDL rules and the temporal order component contains a set of expressions which determine the legitimate orders in which actions defined in the rule component can occur. In this way, SDL maintains a strict distinction between a component which reveals the constituent structure of a CS and a component which reveals temporal precedence. This is motivated by arguments concerning the representational flexibility of Generalised Phrase Structure Grammars where a similar distinction is made (see the exposition of the "ID/LP" format in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref>).</p><p>As discussed in 2.2.1, CMC is characterised by the breakdown of temporal orders which require strict adjacency and yet this does not entail the elimination of all constraint on action order. Similarly, group working -as revealed in the interviews we have discussed -may often involve deterministic orders (e.g. a fixed order of business) and less (or un-) constrained orders (e.g. when situated decisions are made regarding the exact order in which a number of independent tasks may be executed). The advantage of dealing with temporal order in a separate component is that such orders can be notated independent of considerations as to the constituent (or episodic) structure of a CS.</p><p>Order Constraint (OC) statements make up SDL's temporal order component and they relate actions in one of two basic ways: Note that no stipulation is made here concerning the order in which the Author creates the report or decides who are the Interested-others who shall receive it for comments. This seems appropriate because, depending on situated factors, the Author may or may not know in advance of writing the report who would be interested in its content. In contrast, many of the other order constraints are derived from a priori considerations. For example, the Interested-others cannot receive the report (i.e. enter into an exchange with the Author) until after the report has been created. Ongoing research in COSMOS is developing 'inferencing schemata' 1333 which will give a generic characterisation to such relations and permit automated derivation of otherwise unstated actions and/or temporal relations between them. A set of inferencing schemata could be embedded in a 'structure editor' which would assist an SDL user in constructing well formed and maximally expressive CS definitions.  We present below a well formed CS definition in SDL which is supposed to capture many aspects of report writing as practiced in the local authority department we have been studying. The entire report writing and Agenda creation activity we model as a number of CSS which are interrelated in ways which we shall not discuss in this paper. The CS below is intended to provide some representation of the global organisation of that part of the activity which concerns the initial authorship of reports and how this can be decomposed into locally organised communicative actions. Of course, it does not (cannot) represent all aspects of the work involved; the point is rather to give an impression of what CS definitions in SDL are like. The CS name appears first followed by the rule component which is followed by the temporal order component. It will be noted that there are two different .%a&amp;" <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref> through the CS depending on In Cosmos, SDL is to be implemented by translating it into a language called KSDL (for Kernel Structure Definition Language) which is then mechanically interpretable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.6">Putting a Well Formed CS Definition Together: An Example</head><p>Thus, SDL is interpretable indirectly through its translation into KSDL. The reasons for this and other KSDL design decisions will not be the subject of this paper but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref> and 1331.</p><p>There are two important differences between KSDL and SDL which are worth noting. First, KSDL is machmeoriented in its design whereas SDL is intended to be available to users of the Cosmos system, either directly or by means of a graphical editing environment within the 'structure editor' <ref type="bibr">[33, 451.</ref> A full KSDL representation of a CS. is considerably less readable than SDL, giving little impression of the constituent structure of the CS and including much redundancy. Second, whereas SDL represents a CS in its entirety, KSDL partitions the actions expressed in SDL into scripts. There is a script for each role defined in SDL and all the actions associated with a role are represented in the appropriate script. The sequencing of the actions in each KSDL script is derived from SDL's OC statements and the coordination between scripts is sustained through message passing. Script partitioning has a number of consequences; for example, what for SDL is a single exchange becomes represented in KSDL twice or more, once in the script corresponding to the initiating role and once in each of the scripts corresponding to the recipient roles.</p><p>KSDL is currently being developed by Tim Roberts, Jean Dollimore and George Coulouris at Queen Mary College, London and a working prototype Cosmos system will be undergoing testbed evaluation this year. It is hoped that the prototype will implement most features of SDL and the SDL/KSDL conversion process. In our presentation of SDL, we have insisted on exchanges as marking the sites of locally managed communicative action. On this view exchanges, and therefore illocutionary acts, do not necessarily stand in a one-to-one correspondence with turns (moments of message passing); although an exchange can be initiated through the transmission of some object, further interaction may ensue before it is completed. Prima facie, such flexibility in the representation of exchanges, seems to leave it indeterminate when an action is completed and hence unclear when any events contingent on the completion of an action become expectable, If it's always possible for situated reasons to 're-open' an exchange, how is a CBMS implementing SDL going to be able to follow what's going on?</p><p>We believe this is a radical indeterminacy, in the same sense as Quine <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref> once argued for the notorious case of radical translation, and that it cannot be ignored by designers of systems for CSCW without unwittingly coercing their users. We are currently exploring ways of formally addressing such indeterminacy in SDL without sacrificing its utility as a means by which users may represent to themselves their own practices. As Winograd and Flores <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref> have emphasised. design is ontological: design changes the social world not merely the tools within it. But how might design practices negotiate ontological violence?</p><p>We think this is a challenge to CSCW researchers generally: how to design a system which facilitates and enhances communicative action by capturing some of the richness of its texture, without artificially limiting its openness to local and global change.</p><p>:</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>we are concerned with computer-based message systems (CBMSs) and computer-mediated communication (CMC). a technology and a form of communication which have developed since McLuhan's best known works.

B: Yes we do. Would you like one of those? A: Yes please. B: Okay. (turns to get) Indeed, it can be possible to carry the 'veiling' of a request further and proceed directly from the pre-request to the requested action. Truncated sequences like this are ubiquitous as the following two examples show [21. p60 and ~681: A: Have you got Embassy Gold please? B: Yes dear.

The following fragments are taken from that definition and exhibit the EA notation: Author create report Interested-others create comments from report Author create backgound-documents-list from report Exchanges are the elementary communicative acts and involve at least two roles and typically one object. The simplest syntactic form of an exchange in SDL is as follows: [object] [role-name] [role-name] and the following fragments exemplify this form: report Author Line-manager report summary Author Director</figDesc></figure>

Although the forms above express c and , as binary relations, it is readily possible to give unambiguous interpretations to chains of actions related by &lt; or ,.
