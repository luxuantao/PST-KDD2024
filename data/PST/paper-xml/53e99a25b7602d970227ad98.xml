<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Stability problems for time-delay systems have been a topic of longstanding interest; the monographs <ref type="bibr">[ 121 and [20]</ref> record extensive studies on these problems. A specific notion conceming stability of delay systems is asymptotic stability independent of delay. This notion was formally introduced in, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[IS]</ref>, and has received considerable research interest in the past decade. Roughly, a timedelay system is said to be asymptotically stable independent of delay if that system maintains stability with respect to all nonnegative delay parameters.</p><p>The earlier development on asymptotic stability independent of delay has led to many useful results, particularly for linear timeinvariant systems with commensurate delays. Noteworthy are the so-called two-variable criterion developed in <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> and its subsequent modifications in <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>. The two-variable criterion was initially deemed both necessary and sufficient for asymptotic stability independent of delay, but later was found in <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref> to be only sufficient, so are the criteria in <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>. More recently, improved stability tests based on the two-variable criterion have also been reported in <ref type="bibr">[SI,</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>, and these tests provide necessary and sufficient conditions. Briefly, the tests of <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> require that a polynomial be generated first from two bivariate polynomials and that its roots be solved next. The step of generating the polynomial, however, may be a difficult task for high-order systems with many delays, and there seems to be no systematic procedure for performing this task. On the other hand, the test of [ 151 requires the use of a bilinear transformation and then testing the stability of a delay-free polynomial, whose coefficients, however, depend on a real parameter. A Routh-Hurwitz test was suggested in <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> to accomplish this step, which requires generating and solving a sequence of polynomials (i.e., polynomials forming the first column of the Routh-Hunvitz table). Likewise, for systems with many delays, difficulty may also arise in generating a parameterdependent Routh-Hurwitz table. Moreover, the criterion in <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> requires a somewhat complicated recursive procedure. To summarize, though these criteria can be effectively tested for low-order systems, their implementation, as noted in <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>, may encounter a varying degree of difficulty for high-order systems, for which algebraic techniques become less effective and numerical computations play a more important role.</p><p>In this note we consider asymptotic stability independent of delay for both commensurate and noncommensurate delay systems. Our approach is motivated by the current research in robust stability analysis. This approach proves both natural and fruitful for studying asymptotic stability independent of delay. Indeed, in an inexact sense, asymptotic stability independent of delay may itself be interpreted as a robust stability problem. Our development leads to several necessary and sufficient conditions that possess the form of typical small gain conditions in robust stability analysis. An important robust stability measure known as the structured singular value [lo], <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref> is used to quantify these conditions. As such, these conditions may be tested rather efficiently using the well-developed computational methods <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref> and softwares <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> in robust stability analysis. Furthermore, since they are small gain conditions, these results may provide a useful starting point for studying both stability and stabilization problems for uncertain systems independent of delay.</p><p>Our results differ from and complement the previous work in two aspects. First, we consider delay systems given in state-space form, unlike in the previous work which almost always involves returning, at some point, to an analysis of systems in the form of a scalar differential-difference equation, or a bivariate polynomial. The statespace formulation is slightly more general than that of a two-variable polynomial. Furthermore, though it is always possible to transform the former class of systems to the latter ones, such transformations will necessarily result in a significant level of computational complexity. Our approach avoids completely such complexity. Secondly, our results provide a systematic, computation-oriented frequency sweeping test that is particularly amenable to numerical implementation. This ease of implementation makes it suitable for analyzing systems with high dimensions and many delays. It is worth noting that frequency sweeping tests have become standard tools in robust control theory and are generally considered to be effective (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[2] and [23]</ref>).</p><p>In comparison, the earlier tests require more or less analysis "by hand" or symbolic computations and may be difficult to implement for systems with high orders and multiple delays. As a final remark, it is also useful to point out that for systems of noncommensurate delays, our results may provide only de facto sufficient conditions since the exact computation of the structured singular value is difficult. This difficulty becomes even more serious when the system under consideration is uncertain, as one then needs to compute a structured singular value with respect to real and complex uncertainties. This problem is known to be difficult <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Partial results in this paper have been previously presented in <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Systems with a Single Delay</head><p>To outline the key ideas in our derivation, it is instructive to consider first systems with a single delay. In this section we attempt to do so by examining specifically the delay system h 2 0.</p><p>(3.1) First, the following necessary condition is known (see, e.g., [13], Lemma 3.1: Suppose that system (3.1) is asymptotically stable independent of delay.

Then, (SI --4)-'B is analytic on C+ and so is (SI</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">- .4)-'BFh5 for any h 2 0.

Consequently, we conclude that condition ii) is indeed necessary for (3.1) to be asymptotically stable independent of delay. Similarly, we may establish the necessity of the condition p ( ( j d 1 -A)-'B) 5 1 for w = 0, and hence, the necessity of iii)-1) and iii)-2). The proof is As an immediate consequence, the above result leads to the following sufficient condition: System (3.1) is asymptotically stable independent of delay if i) A is asymptotically stable and ii) now completed. 0 p ( ( j w 1 -A ) -' B ) &lt; 1, vu 2 0.</p><p>(3.4) </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Since p ( ( s 1 -A ) -' B ) = p x l ( ( s I -A ) -' B ) , i</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">A -BL) # 0, v s E C+, VIZ1<label>5 1.</label></formula><p>(3.5)</p><p>This equivalence explains why in general a two-variable criterion cannot be necessary. To see this, we observe that the necessity of a small gain condition such as px, ( M ) &lt; 1 hinges on the existence of an "uncertainty" A E Xy(l) with which the matrix 1 -M A loses its rank, and this underlies our above derivation. Indeed, in establishing the necessity of Theorem 3.1, a key has been to construct a delay parameter h or a A(s) = P -~" I such that the matrix I -(SI -A)-'BA(s) loses its rank. Such a A(s) can be found for s # 0 because h 2 0 can be selected arbitrarily. For s = 0, however, the construction of A(s) is not possible despite the fact that h can be selected arbitrarily. This is precisely where the two- U 2 0 achieved at any interior point of C+. As a result, conditions ii) and iii)-l) imply that p ( ( s 1 -A ) -~B ~-~'</p><p>) &lt; 1 for all s E C+ and for all h 2 0. This leads to the fact that det (I -(SI -A -' B P -~" )</p><p># 0 for all s E C+ and for all h 2 0. The latter condition, however, is equivalent to This result, initially given in <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>, requires computing the H , norm of the transfer function (SI -A ) -' B and hence can be verified more easily. d e t ( s 1 -A -Be-h") # 0, Vs E C+, V h 2 0.</p><p>(3.3) Hence, system (3.1) is asymptotically stable independent of delay. Alternatively, conditions ii) and iii)-2) imply that p ( ( s I - A)-'Be-h') &lt; 1 for all h 2 0 and for all s E C+, s # 0, which in turn leads to condition (3.3) for all h 2 0 and for all s E e+, s # 0. At s = 0, condition (3.3) also holds since det(A + B) # 0. Hence again, system (3.1) is asymptotically stable independent of delay. This completes the proof for sufficiency. To establish the necessity, it suffices, in light of Lemma 3.1, to show that ii) and iii) are necessary. Toward this end, assume first that p( (julI -A ) -' B ) = 1 for some w &gt; 0. This implies that the matrix </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Systems with Multiple Delays</head><p>We shall now extend the preceding results to systems with multiple delays. We shall consider first systems with noncommensurate delays. Note that with either commensurate or noncommensurate delays, system (2.1) will be asymptotically stable independent of delay only when A is asymptotically stable.

Since liniu-m p ( ( j w I -A)-'B) = 0, and since p ( ( j u l I -A)-'B) is a continuous function of ul, it follows that p ( ( j w 0 I -A ) -' B ) = 1 p , ~, ( h f ( O ) ) = 1 and det(1 -M ( 0 ) ) # 0, where M ( s ) E CnyXnq is defined as for some 41 E ( u l , , ~) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Let ~( s )</head><p>:= d i a g ( ~-h l s l , . . . , e -h q s l ) .</p><p>It follows that (3.7) is satisfied if and only if det(1 -M ( s ) A ( s ) ) # 0 for all s E C+ and for all h k 2 0.

Alternatively, conditions ii) and iii)-2) imply that for all h k 2 0, p ( M ( s ) A ( s ) ) 5 1 for all s E C+, and in particular, p ( M ( s ) A ( s ) ) &lt; 1 for all s E C+ such that s # 0. This suggests that (3.7) holds for all s E C+ such that s # 0. Moreover, since det,(I -M ( 0 ) ) # 0, it follows that (3.7) holds at s = 0 as well. Consequently, conditions i)-iii) imply that system (2.1) is asymptotically stable independent of delay. The proof for the sufficiency part is completed. To show the necessity, assume first that p x q ( M ( j d ) ) = 1 for some i j &gt; 0. Then, there exists Q = diag(e-3"11,,.... .e-3" q T V L ) for some o k E [0, 2x1, k = 1,. . . &gt; Q such that dct,(I -M ( j u ) Q ) = 0. A set of delay constants may then be constructed as h k = rv.li/d, so that condition (3.7) is violated at s = j d . If, however, p , y q ( M ( j u ) ) &gt; 1 for some w &gt; 0, then by the continuity of p , r q ( M ( j w ) ) and also by the fact that liniw-a p , ~~( M ( j u ) ) = 0, there exists some WO E (U, cx)) such that p , ~~( M ( j u ~) )</p><p>= 1. Again, in this case, condition (3.7) will be violated at s = j d ~. Hence, for (3.7) to hold, it is necessary that ii) holds. Finally, we claim that it is also necessary that pxq (M (0)) 5 1, hence establishing the necessity of iii). Indeed, if fix, ( M ( 0 ) ) &gt; 1, then by continuity there exists d &gt; 0 such that p x , ( M ( j w ) ) = 1, and as shown above, condition (3.7) will be violated at s = j w . The Again, for noncommensurate delay systems, Theorem 3.2 provides an extended small gain condition for the asymptotic stability of (2.1) independent of delay. This condition can be checked by computing a structured singular value. Though in principle the exact computation of structured singular values can be accomplished using a power iteration method [23], computational difficulties may generally arise. Hence, in effect, Theorem 3.1 provides only a de facto sufficient condition. Nevertheless, since an accurate estimate of the structured singular value may be obtained by computing the upper bound in (2.4) <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>, this condition may be tight. Moreover, compared with a necessary and sufficient condition given in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, an improvement in Theorem 3.2 is that it provides a characterization that can be analyzed systematically and that the test can be computed approximately. Finally, note that pxq ( M ( j d ) ) can be determined explicitly when the matrix <ref type="bibr">[BI B, ]</ref>  Then, U = 1, V k = b k . and one obtains Consequently, system (2.1) will be asymptotically stable independent of delay if and only if --a &gt; E:=, Ibtl, or --a = E:=, IbkI but a + E',=, b k # 0. These discussions lead to the same simplified results obtained in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</p><p>To conclude this section, we give below a necessary and sufficient condition for the case of commensurate delays. The key step in our derivation is to convert the stability problem into one with respect to a single delay.</p><p>Theorem 3.3: Suppose that in (2.1) h k = k h for some h 1 0.</p><p>Then system (2.1) is asymptotically stable independent of delay if and only if i) A is asymptotically stable, ii) </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">p ( M , ( j w ) ) &lt; 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>0</head><p>As a consequence of Theorem 4.1, the robust asymptotic stability of (4.1) independent of delay can, in principle, be determined by computing a structured singular value with respect to mixed real and complex uncertainties <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. This computation, however, is even more difficult than that required in Theorem 3.2, due to the presence of real uncertainties. Indeed, it is known [4] that the problem of computing structured singular values with respect to real and complex uncertainties is in general NP-hard. As such, the main utility of Theorem 4.1 lies in that it provides an analysis tool and a potentially nonconservative sufficient condition which can be obtained by computing an upper bound of the structured singular value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES</head><p>We now test a number of examples. Our first example is a 4 x 4 system with three delay units. This example demonstrates that our test can be fairly effective for systems with high dimensions and many delay units.</p><p>Example 5.1: Consider system (2.1), with n = 4 and q = 3, of commensurate delays, given by 1 0 0</p><p>A : = I a : I . A simple computation shows that the eigenvalues of A are at -0.G887f 1.763Gj and -0.3113 f 0.G790j. Hence, A is asymptotically stable. Moreover, it can be found that p ( M q ( 0 ) ) = 0.8417.</p><p>As such, we need to examine condition (3.8) to check stability independent of delay. The spectral radius p ( M , ( j w ) ) is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1</ref>. From this plot, it is clear that condition (3.8) is not satisfied. Therefore, we conclude that the system is not stable independent of delay.</p><p>The next example serves to illustrate that our results can also be used to analyze simple delay systems analytically. Such an analysis is restricted to systems with low dimensions and only a few delay units; many of the examples in this class can be found in We want to determine the range of T and A such that the system is stable independent of delay. Note first that the conditions iii)-I) and iii)-2) give an allowable range of T as (-1, 11. Let h be the Jordan form of A, and let A, be its eigenvalues. Then, it follows that Hence, if A, E R for all i , we have p ( r ( j w 1 -A ) -' A ) &lt; 1 for all w &gt; 0 and all T E (-1.11. In other words, system (5.3) will be asymptotically stable independent of delay for all r E (-1,1]. On the other hand, if A has complex eigenvalues, then</p><p>This suggests that the system will be stable independent of delay for only Note that this example was studied in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this note we have studied stability properties of linear timeinvariant delay systems. A main feature about our results is that they can be systematically implemented; indeed, stated in terms of structured singular values, these conditions may be checked by making use of the well-documented softwares developed for robustness analysis in general and for structured singular value analysis in particular (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>). This is especially the case for systems with commensurate delays, for which our test amounts to computing the spectral radius of a frequency dependent matrix. For systems of noncommensurate delays, the computation becomes harder but a possibly nonconservative sufficient condition can be obtained readily by computing an upper bound of the structured singular value. While these frequency sweeping tests provide a useful complement to the previous work, it is desirable to develop similar computational tests that involve computing constant matrices only, as such tests would have advantages over both the present results and those developed in, e.g., </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 6.

Note that by imposing an additional condition det(A + B z ) # 0 for all ) : I 5 1 in Definition 2.1, as suggested in [ 191, then, both conditions (3.4) and (3.5) become necessary. This extra condition is equivalent to p(A-'B) &lt; 1, and it restricts the class of systems which may be considered.
