<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many activities in business process management, such as process retrieval, process mining, and process integration, need to determine the similarity or the distance between two processes. Although several approaches have recently been proposed to measure the similarity between business processes, neither the definitions of the similarity notion between processes nor the measure methods have gained wide recognition. In this paper, we define the similarity and the distance based on firing sequences in the context of workflow nets (WF-nets) as the unified reference concepts. However, to many WF-nets, either the number of full firing sequences or the length of a single firing sequence is infinite. Since transition adjacency relations (TARs) can be seen as the genes of the firing sequences which describe transition orders appearing in all possible firing sequences, we propose a practical similarity definition based on the TAR sets of two processes. It is formally shown that the corresponding distance measure between processes is a metric. An algorithm using model reduction techniques for the efficient computation of the measure is also presented. Experimental results involving comparison of different measures on artificial processes and evaluations on clustering real-life processes validate our approach.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Nowadays, process-aware information systems, such as WFM (Workflow Management system), SCM (Supply Chain Management), PDM (Product Data Management system) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) have been widely adopted in industry to offer generic modeling and enactment capabilities for structured business processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. Business processes accumulated in various information systems have become important intellectual assets which represent the real-life business handling procedures of the organizations. A deep insight into these business processes and their mutual relationship is necessary to business management activities. There are many applications in business process management that require measuring the similarity between business processes, such as process retrieval, process mining, and process integration. For example, the task items of a workflow process in Teamcenter PDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> is established before the control-flow structure. Therefore, different workflow designers may construct different processes with the same set of task items. We need to determine whether the behaviors of these models are equivalent or not, and how different their behaviors are in case of inequivalence. Another example is China CNR Corporation Limited <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> which is a newly regrouped company which has more than 20 subsidiary companies. Before the corporation was established, most of these subsidiary companies independently deployed ERP systems with a total of more than 200,000 process models. Now, CNR needs to integrate these ERP systems. How to group or cluster these processes is a big problem. Measuring the similarity between process models automatically will be helpful in tackling these challenges.</p><p>Researchers working on formal methods have proposed a variety of equivalence notions to compare the behaviors between processes, such as trace equivalence, bisimulation, and branching bisimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19]</ref>. However, these equivalence notions can only tell a binary answer, i.e., equivalence or inequivalence. If we measure the similarity between processes based on equivalence notions, e.g., mapping equivalence to 1 and inequivalence to 0, such a measure is not very useful because it cannot distinguish between complete difference and slight difference of process behaviors. As to Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we investigate process behaviors in the context of trace semantics. The firing sequences of Processes N 1 , N 2 , and N 3 are fABD; ACDg, fABCD; ACBDg, and fABCD; ACBDg, respectively. The firing sequences of Process N 4 cannot be enumerated one by one (i.e., infinite) because there is a loop structure in Process N 4 . Intuitively, these models are similar in some sense. However, with the trace equivalence notion, we cannot tell the degree of similarity between them except that Processes N 2 and N 3 are equivalent.</p><p>Recent literature has proposed different approaches to quantifying the similarity between business processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11]</ref>. Although firing sequences are a good representation of the behavior of a process, they are neither possible (e.g., with loop structures) nor practical due to the high complexity of exploring state space of concurrent models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. Therefore, the proposed approaches for measuring similarity are all based on substitute representations, such as on causal footprints <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> or observed behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref> in the context of different definitions of the similarity notion. However, the results of these similarity measures cannot be compared with each other because they lack a unified definition of the similarity between processes.</p><p>In this paper, we define the similarity and the distance between two business processes on full firing sequences of the processes as the unified reference concepts. However, the full firing sequences of a process are not always available. For example, to a WF-net with loop structures, either the number of full firing sequences or the length of a single firing sequence is infinite. Considering that transition adjacency relations (TARs) can be seen as the genes of the firing sequences because the TAR set can specify the exact behavior of a large category of processes (e.g., SWF-nets) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we define a computable similarity based on the TAR set. The TAR set describes transition orders that appear in all possible firing sequences (one directly follows the other). For example, the TAR sets of Processes N 1 , N 2 , N 3 and N 4 are fAB; AC; BD; CDg, fAB; AC; BC; CB; BD; CDg, fAB; AC; BC; CB; BD; CDg and fAB; AC; BC; CB; BB; CC; BD; CDg, respectively, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We can see that the TAR set of Process N 4 is finite despite of its infinite firing sequences. The TAR set has three features. Firstly, the TAR set represents the essence of the firing sequences of a process. Secondly, for any processes with a finite number of tasks, the cardinality of the TAR set is finite. Thirdly, the TAR set of a WF-net can be generated in less time than that of a full firing sequence generation. At the same time, the corresponding distance measure between business processes is also defined. The distance measure is proved to be a metric which can be used in a wide range of applications.</p><p>This paper makes three contributions: firstly, it presents a definition of the similarity (and the distance) between processes based on firing sequences as a unified reference concept; secondly, it proposes a similarity measure (and distance measure) based on transition adjacency relation set; thirdly, both distance measures are proved to be metrics.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some basic concepts used throughout the paper. Section 3 describes the details of our approach to measuring similarity between business processes. Section 4 proposes an algorithm intended to decrease the time required for the TAR set generation. Section 5 shows the experimental results. Section 6 discusses the related work, and Section 7 concludes the paper and outlines future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preliminaries</head><p>In this section, we introduce some basic concepts used throughout the paper, such as Petri nets and WF-nets. For a more detailed introduction, we refer the readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Petri nets</head><p>Petri net is a formal language which can be used to specify processes. Since the language has formal and executable semantics, processes modelled in Petri nets can be executed by an information system. A Petri net consists of three modeling elements: Transition, which typically corresponds to either an activity (task, process step) which needs to be executed, or a silent step (i.e., t task) which is used for routing purposes; Place, which is used to define the preconditions and postconditions of transitions. A transition can be fired (executed) if the precondition is satisfied. The result of such a firing will be that the postcondition holds; transitions and places are connected through directed arcs in such a way that (i) places and transitions have at least one incident edge and (ii) in every path, transitions and places alternate (no place is connected to another place and no transition is connected to another transition). A formal definition of conventional Petri nets is presented as follows.</p><p>Definition 1. (Petri nets) A Petri net is a triple ðP; T; FÞ, where: P is a finite set of places, T is a finite set of transitions, P [ T 6 ¼ ? and P \ T ¼ ? , F ðP Â TÞ [ ðT Â PÞ is a set of directed arcs representing flow relations, joining places and transitions together.</p><p>To denote the state of process execution, the concept of a token is used. A token in a place shows that a certain condition holds. Each place can arbitrarily contain many of such tokens. If a transition Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Sample process models in WF-nets (Note that a black block in process N 4 represents a t task).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The TAR sets of processes shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> where 1 means there is a TAR. execution occurs (or fires), one token is removed from each of its input places and one token is produced in each of the output places, which restricts the behavior in such a way that a transition can only occur when there is at least one token in each of the input places. The distribution of tokens over the places is called a state, or a marking.</p><p>Transitions are the active components in a Petri net: they change the state of the net according to the following firing rules:</p><p>A transition t is said to be enabled if and only if each input place p of t contains at least one token. An enabled transition may be fired.</p><p>If transition t fires, then t consumes one token from each input place p of t and produces one token in each output place p of t. Given a Petri net ðP; T; FÞ and a state M 1 , we have the following notations: x and y, there is a path leading from x to y.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M 1 ! t M 2 :</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">WF-nets</head><p>A Petri net model of a real-life business process is usually connected. It often has only one source place to denote the beginning of a process, and only one sink place to denote the end. Such a Petri net is called a workflow net (WF-net) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In this paper, we suppose that all processes are safe WF-nets, and each source place is initially marked. The formal definition of a WF-net is presented below. We use the following notation: t denotes the set of input places for a transition t, and t denotes the set of output places for a transition t. The notations p and p have similar meanings. A kind of WF-net with constraints is called a structured WF-net (SWF-net) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Not all WF-nets are SWF-nets. For example, a WFnet with non-free choice constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> is not an SWF-net.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 5. (SWF-nets) A WF-net is an SWF-net if and only if:</head><p>For all p 2 P and t 2 T with ð p; tÞ 2 F: j pj &gt; 1 implies jtj ¼ 1, For all p 2 P and t 2 T with ð p; tÞ 2 F: jtj &gt; 1 implies j pj ¼ 1, There is no such implicit place p that for all reachable markings s 0 of initial marking s and t 2 p, s 0 ! tnf pg ) s 0 ! t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Similarity measure between processes</head><p>In this section, we first discuss the similarity measure between WF-nets based on firing sequences. After that, the similarity measure based on the TAR set is proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Reference similarity measure</head><p>Intuitively, a WF-net can be seen as a graph. However, the similarity or the distance of graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, e.g., editing distance, cannot be directly used in the context of WF-nets. A slight difference in graph may lead to significant change in behavior of a WF-net, while the same behavior may derived from two very different graphs. In fact, the full firing sequences are a valid representation of the behavior of a WF-net. If two processes have the same full firing sequences, they are regarded as have the same behavior (i.e., trace equivalence).</p><p>According to an information-theoretic definition of similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, we can construct similarity between process based on firing sequences. Here, the commonality of two processes are the intersection sets of the their full firing sequences. The ratio between the intersection set and the union set of their full firing sequences represents the similarity between them. The larger intersection set, the greater the similar in behavior. Thus, we develop a similarity between processes whose value ranges from 0 to 1. When the full firing sequence sets of two business processes are the same, the similarity between them will be the maximum: 1. When the intersection of the two sets is an empty set, the similarity will be the minimum: 0. A bigger value of the similarity means more similar between the two WF-nets, and vice versa.</p><p>The formal definition of the similarity based on the firing sequences is as follows. Definition 6. (Reference similarity) Let N 1 and N 2 be two WF-nets with initial markings M 1 and M 2 , respectively, and the corresponding sets of firing sequences be FS 1 and FS 2 . The reference similarity between N 1 and N 2 is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">similarityððN 1 ; M 1 Þ; ðN 2 ; M 2 ÞÞ ¼ jFS 1 \ FS 2 j jFS 1 [ FS 2 j :</formula><p>Consequently, we can define the distance between two processes as follows: Definition 7. (Reference distance) Let N 1 and N 2 be two WF-nets with initial markings M 1 and M 2 , respectively, and the corresponding sets of firing sequences be FS 1 and FS 2 . The reference distance between N 1 and N 2 is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">distanceððN 1 ; M 1 Þ; ðN 2 ; M 2 ÞÞ ¼ jFS 1 [ FS 2 À FS 1 \ FS 2 j jFS 1 [ FS 2 j : Since FS 1 [ FS 2 FS 1 \ FS 2 , jFS 1 [ FS 2 À FS 1 \ FS 2 j ¼ jFS 1 [ FS 2 jÀ jFS 1 \ FS 2 j, then distanceððN 1 ; M 1 Þ; ðN 2 ; M 2 ÞÞ ¼ 1 À ðjFS 1 \ FS 2 j= jFS 1 [ FS 2 jÞ.</formula><p>In fact, the distance measure is a metric. Theorem 1. Let Q be a space of processes. Let d be the reference distance between processes. Then, ðQ ; dÞ is a metric space.</p><p>Proof. We need prove that d is a distance function of the metric space which fulfills the four properties of a metric, i.e., non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and triangle inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Let N 1 , N 2 and N 3 be marked WF-nets, and FS 1 , FS 2 and FS 3 be the full firing sequences, respectively. Then, Non-negativity, i.e., dðN 1 ;</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">N 2 Þ ! 0). Since FS 1 \ FS 2 FS 1 [ FS 2 , then jFS 1 \ FS 2 j jFS 1 [ FS 2 j. Therefore, ðjFS 1 \ FS 2 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 jÞ 1, thus, dðN 1 ; N 2 Þ ¼ 1 À ðjFS 1 \ FS 2 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 jÞ ! 0.</formula><p>Identity of indiscernibles, i.e., dðN 1 ;</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">N 1 Þ ¼ 0.dðN 1 ; N 1 Þ ¼ 1 À ðjFS 1 \ FS 1 j=jFS 1 [ FS 1 jÞ ¼ 1 À 1 ¼ 0. Symmetry, i.e., dðN 1 ; N 2 Þ ¼ dðN 2 ; N 1 Þ. Since FS 1 \ FS 2 ¼ FS 2 \ FS 1 and FS 1 [ FS 2 ¼ FS 2 [ FS 1 , then dðN 1 ; N 2 Þ ¼ 1 À ðjFS 1 \ FS 2 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 jÞ ¼ 1 À ðjFS 2 \ FS 1 j=jFS 2 [ FS 1 jÞ ¼ dðN 2 ; N 1 Þ. Triangle inequality, i.e., dðN 1 ; N 2 Þ dðN 1 ; N 3 Þ þ dðN 3 ; N 2 Þ. It is a sufficient condition that ðjFS 1 \ FS 3 j=jFS 1 [ FS 3 jÞ þ ðjFS 2 \ FS 3 j=jFS 2 [ FS 3 jÞ 1 þ ðjFS 1 \ FS 2 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 jÞ.</formula><p>Note that, for any two sets Set 1 and Set 2 , there exists</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Set 1 \ Set 2 Set 1 [ Set 2 . Thus, ðjFS 1 \ FS 3 j=jFS 1 [ FS 3 jÞ þ ðjFS 2 \ FS 3 j=jFS 2 [ FS 3 jÞ ðjfFS 1 \ FS 3 g [ FS 2 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 [ FS 3 jÞ þ ðjfFS 2 \ FS 3 g [ FS 1 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 [ FS 3 jÞ ðjFS 1 [ FS 2 [ FS 3 j þ jFS 1 \ FS 2 \ FS 3 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 [ FS 3 jÞ ¼ 1 þ ðjFS 1 \ FS 2 \ FS 3 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 [ FS 3 jÞ 1 þ ðjFS 1 \ FS 2 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 jÞ, therefore, dðN 1 ; N 2 Þ dðN 1 ; N 3 Þ þ dðN 3 ; N 2 Þ. &amp;</formula><p>Despite its advantage, the reference similarity (or the reference distance) is not practical. When a WF-net has loop structures, its firing sequences are not finite. For example, we cannot calculate similarity between Process N 4 and the other three processes (In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) because Process N4 does not have a finite set of full firing sequences. Moreover, the measure is too rigid, i.e., one different step in a sequence invalidates the entire sequence. For example, the full firing sequences of Processes N 1 , N 2 are fABD; ACDg and fABCD; ACBDg, respectively. Thus, similarityðN 1 ; N 2 Þ ¼ 0 shows that Processes N 1 and N 2 are completely different, though they have similar subsequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">A similarity measure based on the TAR set</head><p>Since the full firing sequences of a process cannot always be obtained, it is necessary to find an approximate measure. The efforts lead to a substitute measure based on transition adjacency relation (TAR) set.</p><p>The concept of TAR is inspired by the definition of event log relation &gt; w presented in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> which shows that a complete set of transition adjacency relation can specify the behavior of a process (e.g., SWF-nets). The finding motivates us to measure the similarity between business processes based on the TAR set. The advantage of using the TAR set is clear. Firstly, there is always an exact TAR set for any process regardless of its control-flow structure. Secondly, the TAR set of a process is easier to be generated because of the compositionality of TARs, as discussed in Section 4. The formal definition of TAR is as follows. A similarity measure based on the TAR set is defined as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Definition 9.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Some discussions</head><p>Now, we investigate the semantic relationship between the reference similarity similarity and the TAR similarity similarity T through some typical scenarios. Let N 1 and N 2 be two marked WFnets, and let their possible full firing sequences be FS 1 and FS 2 , and their TAR sets be TS 1 and TS 2 , respectively.</p><p>Scenario 1 N 1 and N 2 are the same model. Since N 1 and N 2 are the same model, they must have the same behavior, i.e., FS 1 ¼ FS 2 . Therefore, similarity ¼ 1. Then, similarity ¼ 1 ) similarity T ¼ 1. Both measures indicate that N 1 and N 2 have the same behavior.</p><p>Scenario 2 N 1 is a subnet of N 2 . Since N 1 is a subnet of N 2 in topological structure, there are some structural elements (i.e., transitions, places or arcs) of N 2 missing in N 1 . It is very likely that FS 1 \ FS 2 ¼ ? if one or more transitions of N 2 are missing in N 1 . Therefore, similarity ¼ ðjFS 1 \ FS 2 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 jÞ may fail to reflect the similarity between N 1 and N 2 . However, TS 1 \ TS 2 tends to be a reasonable result which depends on the ratio of N 1 in N 2 , because TS 1 \ TS 2 ¼ ? will be a rare case. Therefore, similarity T ¼ ðjTS 1 \ TS 2 j=jTS 1 [ TS 2 jÞ is more desirable to indicate the similarity between N 1 and N 2 .</p><p>Scenario 3 N 1 and N 2 are both SWF-nets. As presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, if a process is an SWF-net, the TAR set can specify its behavior. Therefore, we have the following theorem. Theorem 3. Let N 1 and N 2 be two SWF-nets with initial markings M 1 and M 2 , respectively. Let the FS 1 and FS 2 of possible full firing sequences be both finite. Let TS 1 and TS 2 be the TAR sets, respectively. Then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(1) similarity T ¼ 1 , similarity ¼ 1, (2) similarity T ¼ 0 ) similarity ¼ 0. Proof. (1) similarity T ððN 1 ; M 1 Þ; ðN 2 ; M 2 ÞÞ ¼ ðjTS 1 \ TS 2 j=jTS 1 [ TS 2 jÞ ¼ 1. Then TS 1 \ TS 2 ¼ TS 1 [ TS 2 . Therefore, TS 1 ¼ TS 2 .</formula><p>Since N 1 and N 2 are both SWF-nets, from a process mining algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we know that</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">TS 1 ¼ TS 2 ) FS 1 ¼ FS 2 . Then, similarityððN 1 ; M 1 Þ; ðN 2 ; M 2 ÞÞ ¼ ðjFS 1 \ FS 2 j=jFS 1 [ FS 2 jÞ ¼ 1.</formula><p>Thus, similarity T ¼ 0 ) similarity ¼ 0. Because the same full firing sequence set FS will always derive the same TAR set TS for any Petri net, we can prove similarity ¼ 1 ) similarity T ¼ 1 flowing the similar steps above.</p><p>(2) similarity T ¼ 0 ) similarity ¼ 0 can also be similarly proved. &amp; Note that, similarity T ¼ 0 ( similarity ¼ 0 is not true because similarity is a more rigid measure than similarity T . Even if similarity ¼ 0, similarity T &gt; 0 may hold if there exists identical subsequences of different sequences between two processes.</p><p>Scenario 4 N 1 and N 2 are not both SWF-nets. Despite the conformance of similarity, similarity T has its limitation. There are WF-nets beyond the range of SWF-nets for which the TAR set cannot specify their exact behavior. An known sample of such WF-nets is non-free choice nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27]</ref>, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Let FS 1 and FS 2 be the full firing sequences of N 1 and N 2 , respectively. Then, FS 1 ¼ fACD; BCEg and FS 2 ¼ fACD; ACE; BCD; BCEg. Thus, similarityððN 1 ; M 1 Þ; ðN 2 ; M 2 ÞÞ ¼ 2=4 ¼ 0:5. It shows that N 1 and N 2 have different behaviors. Let TS 1 and TS 2 be the TAR sets of N 1 and N 2 , respectively. Then, TS 1 ¼ fðA; CÞ; ðB; CÞ; ðC; DÞ; ðC; EÞg and TS 2 ¼ fðA; CÞ; ðB; CÞ; ðC; DÞ; ðC; EÞg. Thus, similarity T ¼ 4=4 ¼ 1. It shows that similarity T is not consistent with similarity because N 1 contains a non-freechoice construct. Therefore, similarity T is not exact precise to evaluate the similarity between business processes with non-freechoice constructs.</p><p>Fortunately, SWF-nets allow for all routing constructs encountered in practice, i.e., sequential, parallel, conditional, and iterative, are possible and the basic workflow building blocks (AND-split, AND-join, XOR-split, and XOR-join) are supported. WF-nets that are not SWF-nets are typically difficult to understand and should be avoided <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In fact, processes with non-free-choice constructs are only a few parts in real-life business processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">An algorithm for the TAR set generation</head><p>A transition adjacency relation is not like a look-ahead/look-back relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> which can be derived quickly from the process structure. Instead, the generation of the TAR set needs to explore the state space of a process. Usually, we can derive the TAR set from the reachable marking graph of a WF-net. A reachable marking graph is a directed graph where each vertex represents a reachable marking and each edge represents a transition. Any input edge and any output edge of a vertex make up a transition adjacency relation. Enumerating all vertexes of a reachable marking graph will lead to the TAR set. However, a reachable marking graph itself is difficult to be built. Building the reachable marking graph of a process by exhausted search method is computationally expensive since the complexity for generating the reachable marking graph for a (safe) net is exponential in the number of nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. Thus, the method is only acceptable when the size of a WF-net is not too large.</p><p>We propose a strategy of divide-and-conquer for a large size WF-net. Firstly, some subnets of the WF-net are replaced by block transitions based on Petri net reduction and subnet replacement techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> We distinguish two types of subnets, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Subnet (a) has a beginning transition and an end transition which can be replaced by a block transition, e.g., a split and a synchronization construct. Subnet (b) has a beginning place and an end place which can be replaced by a block transition with its beginning and end places, e.g., a choice and a join construct. The entry transitions of subnet (a) contain only the beginning transition, and the exit transitions contain only the end transition. While the entry transitions of a subnet (b) are the first enabled transitions after the beginning place is marked, the exit transitions are the last enabled transitions before the end place is marked. We replace a subnet with a block transition to get a reduced WF-net. Thus, there will rise transition adjacency relations with block transitions which need to convert to atomic transition adjacency relation in the end.</p><p>Lemma 1. Let B 1 , B 2 both be block transitions. Then, the TAR &lt; a; b &gt; exists where a 2 exitðB 1 Þ ^b 2 entryðB 2 Þ.</p><p>Proof.

The measure of full firing sequences (i.e., the reference similarity) and the measure of the TAR set are proposed in this paper. The approach of model topology is adapted from a naive approach on structure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. The approach of causal footprints is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> to measure the similarity of EPC processes. The measure of observed behavior is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The reference measure on full firing sequences is rigid. According to the measure, the similarity between Processes N 1 and N 2 , and Processes N 1 and N 3 is 0 because they have no common firing sequence. The similarity between Processes N 2 and N 3 is 1 because the two processes have the same behavior, i.e., the same full firing sequences. However, similarity cannot be calculated between Processes N 4 and the other processes because the full firing sequences of Process N 4 is infinite. The measure of model topology and the measure of causal footprints by their nature are both on topology structures of process models. Despite their low computation complexity, they generally derive a similarity value which are not consistent with the result of the reference measure. For example, Processes N 2 and N 3 have the same behavior as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, but both measures results are far from 1.</p><p>The result of the approach on observed behavior is not listed because it can vary significantly depending on the applied log sets.</p><p>The measure of the TAR set shows the same result between Processes N 2 and N 3 as the reference similarity. It can calculate the similarity between Process N 4 and the other processes despite of its loop structure. Moreover, the measure result indicates the similar behavior exists between Processes N 1 , N 2 and N 3 because there are identical subsequences between their firing sequences. In general, the TAR similarity is consistent with the reference similarity but less rigid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Evaluation by real-life process clustering</head><p>A typical application of the similarity measure or the distance measure is to create clusters.

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> shows the time cost of generating the TAR set with different algorithms. The original time is from the algorithm by building reachable marking graph of a WF-net, while the ATG time is from the ATG algorithm. There are a total of eight cases. It shows that original time increases very fast with the increasing WF-nets size. In general, the ATG algorithm save a significant amount of time, especially for large size WF-nets.</p><p>However, the ATG algorithm does little help for WF-nets without many concurrent transitions, when building reachable marking graph does not require much time, as shown in Case 1 to Case 4. Moreover, different reducing strategies can influence the effectiveness of the ATG algorithm. For example, Case 7 and Case 8 are from the same WF-net. With a different choice of constant used in the ATG algorithm, the time required turn out to be is very different. Therefore, without a prior knowledge of a WF-net structure, we have to try different reducing strategies to obtain an optimal result.</p></div>

We define the similarity and the distance between two business processes in this paper. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> an information-theoretic definition of similarity is proposed which can be used in different application domains to construct domainspecific similarity.

However, all of these notions can only provide a true or false answer when they are applied to compare two process models. The similarity notion proposed in this paper can tell not only whether two process models have the same behavior, but also how different their behaviors are in case of inequivalence. Trace equivalence serves as the foundation of our work. Since trace equivalence is defined on execution traces of processes, the notion makes it possible to investigate equivalence in quantification, i.e., the similarity between processes.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the research that is most similar to ours is presented in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11]</ref>. All of them aim to quantify the difference and measure the similarity between business processes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref>, two concepts, precision and recall, are defined to describe the similarity between business processes. An approach based on observed behavior (i.e., event logs) is proposed to quantify the similarity between processes, which takes into account of not only firing sequences but also their frequencies. Both the strengths and weaknesses of the approach comes from event logs. If there are no such event logs or event logs cannot reflect the typical behavior well, the result may be questioned. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, a single indicator sim to measure the similarity is proposed between EPC processes. It uses causal footprints as an abstract representation of the behavior captured by a process model instead of exploring the state space of the process. An additional topic on matching functions is also discussed which is valuable for all efforts on measuring the process behavior similarity. The approach by its nature is based on model structure but not on model behavior.</p><p>Another approach of measuring process similarity is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> which is from a different perspective other than focusing on process control flows. It measures the similarity between process element names and between semantic business process models. It uses the feasibility of semantic business process models for ontological reasoning to consider business rules in similarity calculation.</p><p>Our work is in line with the recent efforts on quantifying similarity between business processes.
