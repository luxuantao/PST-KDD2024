<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>emantic segmentation using remote sensing images, i.e., the assignment of assigning the precise category to every pixel contained in an image <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, plays a critical role in wide range of application scenarios such as land resource management, yield estimation, and economic assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Hitherto the remote sensing community has tried to design assorted classifiers from diverse perspectives, from orthodox methods such as distance measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, to advanced methods including support vector machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and random forest (RF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. However, the high dependency on hand-crafted visual features or mid-level semantic features restricts the flexibility and adaptability of these methods.</p><p>More recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have demonstrated its powerful capacity of automatically capture nonlinear and hierarchical features from images, and have dramatically influenced the field of computer vision (CV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For semantic segmentation, the encoder-decoder frameworks such as SegNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and DeepLab <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> have become the frequently-used schemes. Generally, feature maps generated by the encoder comprise low-level and fine-grained detailed information, while feature maps generated by the decoder contain high-level and coarse-gained semantic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. And skip connections, which combine the low-level and high-level feature maps, are an effective method to boost the semantic extraction ability of encoder-decoder frameworks.</p><p>In U-Net++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, plain skip connections are substituted by nested and dense skip connections, which enhance the ability of skip connections and narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. To make utmost of the multi-scale features, the full-scale skip connections are designed in U-Net 3+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, the design philosophy of full-scale skip connections impliedly indicates that all channels of feature maps generated by different layers share equal weights, and the computational complexity of U-Net 3+ is tremendous. On the contrary, the features generated by different stages own different levels of discrimination. To cope with this issue, in our MACU-Net, we propose a multi-scale skip connection which not only takes full advantages of the multi-scale features, but also realigns channel-wise features responses adaptively.</p><p>Asymmetric convolution blocks (ACB), which own branches with square, horizontal and vertical kernels, could capture refined features by summing up the outputs of three convolutions, which just cause finite increasing in additional computational complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The effectiveness of ACB has been verified in the fields including image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, image denoising <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and medical image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, only the convolutional layers of encoder are replaced by ACB. Aiming at the task of high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation, we thoroughly incorporate ACB with U-Net by substitute all convolutional layers to enhance the representational ability of a standard square-kernel layer.</p><p>Based on the above-mentioned insight and progress, we design a multi-scale connected architecture deep network, MACU-Net with asymmetric convolution blocks. To verify the effectiveness of MACU-Net, we compare the performance of proposed algorithm with SegNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, DeepLab V3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, DeepLab V3+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, FC-DenseNet57 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Attention U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, FGC <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, MSFCN, and U-Net++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MACU-Net: Semantic Segmentation from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images</head><p>Rui Li*, Chenxi Duan*, and Shunyi Zheng S contributions of this letter could be listed as follows:</p><p>1) To take full advantages of the multi-scale features, we design a multi-scale skip connection which can realign channel-wise features responses adaptively. 2) We substitute all convolutional layers of U-Net for asymmetric convolution blocks substitute to enhance the representational ability. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Asymmetric Convolution Block</head><p>Objects may be captured by satellites in any possible orientations. Thus, objects in remote sensing images may be presented at any perspective, which can be summarized as rotation. In order to extract available information contained in remote sensing images, the neural network should be robust to rotation and renders consistent results in different rotations. As reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, different asymmetric convolutions are robust with different rotation objects. As can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, 3×1 kernel is insensitive to horizontal flipping. Hence, asymmetric convolutions are viable schemes to boost the rotation robustness of the neural network.</p><p>Based on above-mentioned insight, we modify the asymmetric convolutions proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and design an asymmetric convolution block (ACB) to capture features from different receptive fields, which can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>. There are three branches in ACB, i.e. 3×3 convolution, a 1×3 convolution, and a 3×1 convolution, to get different information.</p><p>The 3×3 convolution captures features by a relatively large receptive field, while the 1×3 and 3×1 convolutions curb the rotation sensibility of vertical and horizontal flipping separately. Meanwhile, ACB expand the width of the network. The feature maps generated by three branches are added up to obtain fusion result. Finally, batch norm (BN) and ReLU are used to boost the numerical stability and activate the result in a nonlinear manner. The formulation of ACB can be described as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝒙𝒙 � 𝑖𝑖 = 𝐹𝐹 3×3 (𝒙𝒙 𝑖𝑖−1 ) + 𝐹𝐹 1×3 (𝒙𝒙 𝑖𝑖−1 ) + 𝐹𝐹 3×1 (𝒙𝒙 𝑖𝑖−1 )<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝒙𝒙 𝑖𝑖 = σ �𝛾𝛾 𝑖𝑖 𝒙𝒙 � 𝑖𝑖 − 𝐸𝐸(𝒙𝒙 � 𝑖𝑖 ) �𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(𝒙𝒙 � 𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝜖𝜖 𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑖𝑖 �<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where 𝒙𝒙 𝑖𝑖 is the output of the ACB, and 𝒙𝒙 𝑖𝑖−1 is the input of the ACB. 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(•) and 𝐸𝐸(•) represent the variance function and   ACB is used to capture and refine the features of objects in each layer of the encoder, and is attached after each transposed convolution of decoder to avoid the checkerboard pattern and generate smooth image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Multi-Scale Skip Connections</head><p>As information from multi-scales are not fully exploit both by plain connections of U-Net and nested and dense connections of U-Net++, we design the multi-scale skip connections to capture the interplay between the encoder and decode and extract both fine-grained detailed information and coarse-grained semantic information.</p><p>Taking 𝑋𝑋 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 3 as an example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> demonstrates how to generated the feature maps. Firstly, the feature maps of the same-level encoder layer, i.e. 𝑋𝑋 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 3 , are directly connected. Secondly, the fine-grained detailed information contained in lower-level encoder layers, i.e. 𝑋𝑋 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 4 and 𝑋𝑋 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 5 , are delivered by transposed convolution and asymmetric convolution block. Thirdly, the coarse-grained semantic information contained in higher-level encoder layers, i.e. 𝑋𝑋 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 1 and 𝑋𝑋 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 2 , are transmitted by max-pooling and asymmetric convolution block. The above procedure can be formulated as: </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑋𝑋 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖 = ⎩ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎧ 𝑋𝑋 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑁𝑁 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 ��𝐶𝐶(𝐷𝐷(𝑋𝑋 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑘𝑘 ) 𝑘𝑘=1 𝑖𝑖−1</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Channel Attention Block</head><p>With five feature maps with identical size and resolution in hand, we need to further decrease the prodigious number of channels, as well as realign channel-wise features. Motivated by Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, we design the channel attention block (CAB) to reweighting the channel-wise features, which can be seen from the right of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. The aim of CAB is to learn a 1-D weight 𝑊𝑊 𝑆𝑆 ∈ 𝑅𝑅 𝐶𝐶×1×1 which weights the channels of input feature map 𝐹𝐹 ∈ 𝑅𝑅 𝐶𝐶×𝐻𝐻×𝑊𝑊 , where 𝐶𝐶, 𝑊𝑊, and 𝐻𝐻 indicate the number of channels, the height, and the width of the feature map. By multiplying 𝑊𝑊 𝑆𝑆 and 𝐹𝐹, CAB enhances the discriminative channels and restrains the indiscriminative channels.</p><p>First of all, we use a 1×1 convolution with 128 filters to reduce the number of channels. Then, the spatial dimension is squeezed by the operation of an average-pooling and a maxpooling simultaneously. By two convolution layers with 8 filters and ReLU activation functions, the channels of squeezed feature maps are compressed to one-sixteenth of its original number, and then channels are reinstated using two convolution layers with 128 filters. Finally, the sum of two layers is activated by sigmoid and then multiply by the output of the first convolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>This section first introduces the datasets and experimental settings to verify the effectiveness of MACU-Net, and then compares the performance between different frameworks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Datasets</head><p>The effectiveness of MACU-Net is verified using Wuhan Dense Labeling Dataset (WHDLD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>. WHDLD contains 4940 RGB images in the size of 256 × 256 captured by Gaofen 1 Satellite and ZY-3 Satellite over Wuhan urban area. By image fusion and resampling, the images resolution is reach to 2m/pixel. The images contained in WHDLD are labeled with six classes, i.e. bare soil, building, pavement, vegetation, road, and water.</p><p>GID contains 150 RGB images in the size of 7200 × 6800 captured by Gaofen 2 Satellite over 60 cities in China. Each image covering a geographic region of 506 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 2 . The images contained in GID are labeled with six classes, i.e. build-up, forest, farmland, meadow, water, and others. We just select 15 images contained in GID. The principle of selection is to cover whole six classes. And the serial number of the selected images will be released with our open source code 1   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experimental Setting</head><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of MACU-Net, SegNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, DeepLab V3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, DeepLab V3+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, FC-DenseNet57 (tiramisu) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Attention U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, FGC <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, MSFCN, and U-Net++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Excluding SegNet, DeepLab V3 and DeepLab V3+, the remaining methods are all improved version of U-Net.</p><p>All of the models are implemented with PyTorch, and the optimizer is set as Adam with 0.0001 learning rate and 16 batch size. All the experiments are implemented on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080ti GPU with 11 GB RAM. The crossentropy loss function is used as quantitative evaluation and backpropagation index to measure the disparity between the obtained 2D segmentation maps and ground truth.</p><p>For WHDLD, we randomly select 60% images as training set, 20% images as validation set, and the rest 20% images as test set. For GID, we separately partition each image into nonoverlap patch sets with the size of 256 × 256, and just discard the pixels on the edges which cannot be divisible by 256. Thus, 10920 patches are obtained. Then we randomly select 60% patches as training set, 20% patches as validation set, and the rest 20% patches as test set.</p><p>For each dataset, the overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), Kappa coefficient (K), mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Frequency Weighted Intersection over Union (FWIoU), and F1-score (F1) are adopted as evaluation indexes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Results on WHDLD and GID</head><p>The experimental results of different methods on WHDLD and GID are demonstrated in Table <ref type="table">Ⅰ</ref> and Table <ref type="table">Ⅱ</ref>. The performance of proposed MAC-UNet transcends other algorithms in all quantitative evaluation indexes, which can be seen from tables. For WHDLD, the proposed MACU-Net brings near 0.8% improvements on mIoU compared with U-Net++. And for GID dataset, the improvements are more than 1.4% in mIoU and nearly 1% in F1-score, respectively. Some visual results generated by our method and U-Net are provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, which manifest that the proposed MACU-Net can capturn refined features.</p><p>What is more, the number of parameters and the consumptions of calculation are also significant to assess the merit of a framework. The comparison of parameters and 1 https://github.com/lironui/U-Net-with-Multi-Scale-Skip-Connections-and-Asymmetric-Convolution-Blocks. computational complexity between different algorithms are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Ⅲ</ref>, where 'M' is the abbreviation of million, the unit of parameter number, and 'G' is the abbreviation of Gillion (thousand million), the unit of floating point operations. And the comparison demonstrates that the design of MACU-Net is efficient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this letter, to implement semantic segmentation of highresolution remote sensing images, we combine multi-scale features generated by different layers of U-Net and design a multi-scale skip connected architecture, MACU-Net. Using multi-scale skip connections and channel attention blocks, semantic features generated by different layers of U-Net are combined and refined.
