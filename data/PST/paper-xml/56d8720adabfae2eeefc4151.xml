<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preface</head><p>Recent advances in sensing, communication and computation technologies have enabled a group of agents, such as robots, to communicate or sense their relative information and to perform tasks in a collaborative fashion. The past few years witnessed rapidly-growing research in cooperative control technology. Applications range from space interferometry sensing to environmental monitoring, to distributed computing, and distributed target surveillance and tracking. However, the analytical techniques used in cooperative control algorithms have been disparate, and a unified theory has been wanting.</p><p>In this book, we present a passivity-based framework that allows a systematic design of scalable and decentralized cooperative control laws. This framework makes explicit the passivity properties used implicitly in existing results and simplifies the design and analysis of a complex network of agents by exploiting the network structure and inherent passivity properties of agent dynamics. As we demonstrate in the book, this passivity-based framework can be easily tailored to handle classes of cooperative control problems. Each of these problems has important applications in practice. For example, formation control and coordinated path following allow vehicles to maintain a tight relative configuration, thereby achieving effective group sensing or drag force reduction. Attitude coordination ensures that multiple spacecraft keep a precise relative attitude, which is important in space interferometry missions. Cooperative load transport enables robots to move an object around meanwhile exerting desired internal forces on the object.</p><p>To demonstrate the design flexibility offered by the passivity-based framework, we feature various adaptive redesigns. Adaptivity is important in multi-agent systems, as it implies that the agents can adjust their control according to changing conditions. A particularly useful scenario is when a group leader has the group mission plan while the remaining agents have only partial information of the plan. As the leader autonomously modifies the mission plan, it is essential that the rest of the group be able to adapt. We develop adaptive designs with which the agents recover the leader's mission plan. Another scenario that requires adaptivity is when uncertainty exists in agents' controls, such as wind and viscous damping. In this case, the agents should adapt their control laws to simultaneously accommodate this uncer- Multiple robots or sensors have a number of advantages over a single agent, including robustness to failures of individual agents, reconfigurability, and the ability to perform challenging tasks such as environmental monitoring, target localization, that cannot be achieved by a single agent. A cooperative control system consists of a group of autonomous agents with sensing or communication capabilities, for example, robots with camera sensors and vehicles with communication devices. The goal of the group is to achieve prescribed agent and group behaviors using only local information available to each agent from sensing or communication devices. Such local information may include relative configuration and motion obtained from sensing or communication between agents, agent's sensor measurements, and so on. The relative sensing and communication dictates the architecture of information flow between agents. Thus, a cooperative system has four basic elements: group objective, agents, information topology, and control algorithms governing the motion of the agents.</p><p>Examples of group objectives in cooperative control include flocking, schooling, cohesion, guarding, escorting <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">107]</ref>, agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, vehicle formation maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, gradient climbing in an environmental field <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, cooperative load transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">145,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">128]</ref>, distributed estimation and optimal sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">153,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, source seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> and coverage control <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>. Some of the cooperative control objectives involve only relative variables (e.g., relative positions) between agents while others depend on absolute variables (e.g., inertial positions) of agents. We illustrate below some examples of cooperative control. Formation Control. A major focus in cooperative control is formation stability, where the group objective is to stabilize the relative distances/positions between the agents to prescribed desired values. Formation maintenance finds natural applications in coverage control, drag force reduction, and space interferometry. We take space interferometry as a motivating example. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">1</ref>.1, space in- terferometry uses multiple spacecraft pointing towards an object of interest. Each spacecraft collects light from the object. If the relative positions between spacecraft are maintained precisely, an interferometry pattern is generated and measurement of the magnitude and phase of this pattern can be obtained by coherently mixing the light from individual spacecraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">123]</ref>. Multiple such measurements allow reconstruction of the image of the object, which has a much finer resolution than any single spaceborne telescope achieves. In space, position information of individual spacecraft in the earth frame is imprecise or unavailable, whereas relative position between spacecraft can be measured precisely by optical sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Thus, maintaining spacecraft formation in space may make use of only relative position information while maneuvering the formation to point towards objects of interest.</p><p>Agreement. In the agreement problem, the group objective is the convergence of distributed variables of interest (agents' positions or headings, phase of oscillations, etc.) to a common value. Given different contexts, the agreement problem is also called consensus, or synchronization. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">1</ref>.1, space interferometry requires spacecraft to align their attitudes with each other, which is an agreement problem. Agreement problem also has potential applications in schooling and flocking in distributed robotics and biological systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, distributed estimation and sensor fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104]</ref>, fire surveillance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and distributed computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">140,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, among others.</p><p>Optimal Sensing. The group objective for optimal sensing is to optimally place the agents' positions so that certain meaningful utility functions are maximized. Examples of utility functions include probability of detecting a target <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref> and information obtained from a sensor network <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. In this case, the utility functions usually depend on the absolute positions of the agents.</p><p>Most cooperative control problems concern coordinated motion of agents in different scenarios. Therefore, agent dynamics become important in achieving different group objectives. Small mobile sensors or robots can be controlled by directly manipulating their velocities. Such agents are commonly modeled by a first order kinematic model. Depending on the group objective, the agent model can be a simple integrator or a set of integrators subject to nonholonomic constraints, such as a unicycle model. If the group objective is to control the position of the sensor to improve sensing capability, it may suffice to model the sensors as massless points with single integrator kinematics. When the velocities of agents are not directly manipulatable or the masses of the agents are significant, double integrator agent dynamics are more appropriate. In numerous applications, the attitudes of the agents play an important role, which means that agent models in Euler-Lagrangian form or in Hamiltonian form may be required.</p><p>To achieve the group objective, each agent may need information from other agents. If agent i has access to agent j's information, the information of agent j flows to agent i and agent j is a neighbor of agent i. The abstract structure of the information flows in the group is then represented as a graph, where each agent is a node and the information flows between them are represented as links <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> . In many applications, the information flow between agents is achieved by direct sensing or communication. For example, to control the relative distances between the agents, the agents obtain their relative distance information by sensing or by communicating their inertial positions. In some applications, the information flow is realized through a physical medium. For example, consider a group of agents transporting a payload. By interacting with the payload, the agents can obtain the relative information between them without explicit communication. We will illustrate such an example in Chapter 8.</p><p>One of the main challenges in cooperative control design is to achieve prescribed group objectives by distributed feedback laws. The distributed laws make use of information available only to individual agents. Such information includes the information flow from neighbors, and sensor measurements from agent itself. Take the agreement problem as an example. When modeled as a first order integrator, the agent can aggregate the differences between its own state and its neighbors' and take that aggregated value as a feedback control. In this case, the control algorithm is distributed since it only employs information from neighboring agents. If the control algorithm and the agent model are both linear, stability can be analyzed by examining the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix with the help of algebraic graph theory. This approach leads to simple stability criteria for the agreement problem, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>.</p><p>However, for some applications of cooperative control, only nonlinear algorithms can achieve the objective. Consider the following formation control problem: The group objective is to stabilize relative distances (the Euclidean norms of relative positions) between agents to desired values. In this case, the desired equilibria are spheres, which are compact sets containing more than one point. When each agent is modeled as a linear system, such as a double integrator, there is no linear feedback law globally stabilizing the desired equilibria. This is because a linear agent model with linear feedback results in a linear system, whose equilibria can simply be a point or a subspace. Thus, only nonlinear feedback laws may solve this formation control problem. Indeed, most of the formation control algorithms have been proposed in the form of nonlinear artificial attraction and repulsion forces between neighboring agents. The design and analysis of such rules make use of graph theory and potential function methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">What Is in This Book?</head><p>For different cooperative control problems, there are different control design methods. In this book, we introduce a unifying passivity-based framework for cooperative control problems. Under this passivity-based framework, we develop robust, adaptive, and scalable design techniques that address a broad class of cooperative control problems, including the formation control and the agreement problem discussed above.</p><p>This framework makes explicit the passivity properties used implicitly in the Lyapunov analysis of several earlier results, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102]</ref>, and simplifies the design and analysis of a complex network of agents by exploiting the network structure and inherent passivity properties of agent dynamics. With this simplification, the passivity approach further overcomes the simplifying assumptions of existing designs and offers numerous advantages, including:</p><p>1. Admissibility of complex and heterogenous agent dynamics: Unlike some of the existing cooperative control literature where the agent is modeled as a point robot, the passivity approach allows high order and nonlinear dynamics, including Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems. As illustrated in Chapter 5, attitude coordination among multiple rigid bodies can be studied under this passivity framework. In this case, the agent dynamics are in the Hamiltonian form. Chapter 6 discusses the agreement of multiple Lagrangian systems. The passivity approach is further applicable to heterogenous systems in which the agent dynamics and parameters, such as masses, dampings, vary across the group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Design flexibility, robustness and adaptivity:</head><p>The passivity approach abstracts the common core of several multi-agent coordination problems, such as formation stabilization, group agreement, and attitude coordination. Because passivity involves only input-output variables, it has inherent robustness to unknown model parameters. Since passivity is closely related to Lyapunov stability, this passivity approach lends itself to systematic adaptive designs that enhance robustness of cooperative systems. Such design flexibility and adaptivity will be demonstrated in this book by the adaptive designs in Chapters 3, 4 and 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Modularity and scalability:</head><p>The passivity framework yields decentralized controllers which allow the agents to make decisions based on relative information with respect to their neighbors, such as relative distance. A key advantage of the passivity-based design is its modularity, which means that the control laws do not rely on the knowledge of number of other agents, the communication structure of the network, or any other global network parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S S</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">1</ref>.2 If the sensing/communication ranges for both robots are chosen to be the same and one agent is within the sensing/communication range of the other agent, the information flow between them is symmetric. S &gt; 0 denotes the sensing or communication radius.</p><p>Our major assumptions for this passivity-based approach are: Bidirectional Information Topology: Control algorithms with bidirectional information topology tend to have inherent stability properties as we explicate with the help of passivity arguments in this book. Although directional information topology can render stability for first order agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">109]</ref>, it may lead to instability for high order agents, as we illustrate in Example 2.3 in Chapter 2.</p><p>Bidirectional information topology also appears naturally in a number of cooperative control applications. For example, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">1</ref>.2, the information topology of agents with the same sensing range can be modeled as bidirectional. In the load transport problem studied in Chapter 8, the agents exert force on the payload and receive reaction forces from the payload. The exerted force and the reaction force contain implicitly the relative motion information between the agents and the payload. Thus, the information flows are bidirectional.</p><p>Static Information Topology: Our design assumes that the information topology remains unchanged. This is not a restrictive assumption since in most practical situations, the information topology remains static for a certain period of time. If that period of time is long enough, by standard dwell time arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, the closedloop system remains stable. Note that for first order linear consensus protocols, such as those studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>, robustness to arbitrary switching topology has been justified. However, for higher order systems, it is well known that switching may lead to instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. We will show that for first order protocols, the passivitybased framework can handle a broad class of switching topology whereas for higher order cooperative systems, topology switching improperly may result in instability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Basic Graph Theory</head><p>In this book, we will make use of basic result from algebraic graph theory to facilitate our analysis. The results presented in this section are standard in the literature and will be well known to readers familiar with graph theory. A graph is an abstract representation of a group of nodes where some of them are connected by links. More formally, a graph G is an ordered pair G = (V , E) consisting of a set V of nodes and a set E ⊂ V × V of links. Thus, a link is an ordered pair of two distinct nodes.</p><p>A directed link (i, j) is an incoming link to node j and an outgoing link from node i. We then draw an arrow from node i to node j. We call node i (respectively, j) the negative (respectively, positive) end of link (i, j). If both links (i, j) and ( j, i) belong to E, we combine these two links as one undirected link and use a bidirectional arrow to denote this link.</p><p>Depending on the directions of the links, a graph may be categorized as directed or undirected. If a graph G consists of only undirected links, it is undirected. Otherwise, the graph is directed.</p><p>We say node i is a neighbor of node j if the link (i, j) exists in the graph G. This means that for each directional link, the negative end is the neighbor of the positive end. Note that for undirected graphs, if node i is a neighbor of node j, then node j is also a neighbor of node i. We denote by N j the set of neighbors of node j. For i ∈ V , if the number of incoming links to i is the same as the number of outgoing links from i, the graph is balanced. Clearly, an undirected graph is a special balanced graph.</p><p>A directed path is a sequence of p nodes 1, •••, p, such that (i, i + 1) ∈ E, ∀i = 1, •••, p -1. A cycle is a directed path such that the starting and the ending nodes of the path are the same. A graph is called strongly connected if there exists a directed path from any one node to another.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Introduction</head><p>In this chapter, we formulate a coordination problem that is applicable to formation stabilization and group agreement as special cases, and present a class of feedback laws that solve this problem with local information. A key observation is that bidirectional communication gives rise to Structure 4 in Section 1.5, which guarantees that the resulting feedback loop will inherit the passivity properties of its components. By exploiting this structure, we develop a design method which results in a broad class of feedback laws that achieve passivity and, thus, stability of the interconnected system. The passivity approach also leads to a systematic construction of a Lyapunov function in the form of a sum of storage functions for the subsystems.</p><p>As detailed in this chapter, several existing feedback rules for formation stability and group agreement become special cases in the passivity framework.</p><p>The coordination task studied in this chapter is to steer the differences between the output variables of group members to a prescribed compact set. This compact set may be a sphere when the outputs are positions of vehicles that must maintain a given distance in a formation, or the origin if the outputs are variables that must reach an agreement across the group. We thus formulate this task as a set stability problem and use passivity as a tool for constructing a stabilizing feedback law and a Lyapunov function with respect to this set. We prove global asymptotic stability with additional assumptions that guarantee appropriate detectability properties for trajectories away from the set.</p></div>

We also assume that G is connected and that G has undirected links. To simplify the analysis, we assign an orientation to G by considering one of the nodes to be the positive end of the link. As discussed in Section 1.4, the choice of orientation does not change the results because of the symmetric information flow.</p><p>The objective is to develop coordination laws that are implementable with local information (agent i can use the information of agent j if agent j is a neighbor) and that guarantee the following two group behaviors: A1) Each agent achieves in the limit a common velocity vector v(t) ∈ R p prescribed for the group; that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">lim t→∞ | ẋi -v(t)| = 0, i = 1, •••, N; (2.1)</formula><p>A2) If agents i and j are connected by link k, then the difference variable z k</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">z k := N ∑ l=1 d lk x l = x i -x j if k ∈ L + i x j -x i if k ∈ L - i (2.2) converges to a prescribed compact set A k ⊂ R p , k = 1, •••, , where d ik is defined in (1.</formula></div>

(2.39)</formula><p>ii) To establish passivity of the feedback path, we let I denote the subset of indices i = 1, •••, N for which H i is a dynamic block as in <ref type="bibr">(2.11)</ref>, and employ the storage function V b (ξ ) in (2.35), which yields:</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">Vb = ∑ i∈I Ṡi ≤ ∑ i∈I (-W i (ξ i ) + u T i y i ).<label>(2.40)</label></formula><p>Adding to the right-hand side of (2.40)</p><formula xml:id="formula_76">∑ i / ∈I u T i y i ≥ 0 (2.41)</formula><p>which is nonnegative because the static blocks satisfy (1.25) or (2.15), we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_77">Vb ≤ ∑ i∈I (-W i (ξ i ) + u T i y i ) + ∑ i / ∈I u T i y i ≤ -∑ i∈I W i (ξ i ) + u T y (2.42)</formula><p>and, thus, conclude passivity with input u and output y.</p><p>iii) To prove asymptotic stability of the set A we use the Lyapunov function Having proven the existence of solutions for all t ≥ 0, we conclude from (2.44) stability of the set A . However, because the right-hand side of (2.44) vanishes on a superset of A , to prove attractivity of A we appeal to the Invariance Principle<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">1</ref> reviewed in Appendix B.2. To investigate the largest invariant set where V (z, ξ ) = 0 we note from (2.12) that if ξ i = 0 holds identically then u i = 0. Likewise the static blocks satisfy <ref type="bibr">(1.25)</ref> or <ref type="bibr">(2.15)</ref>, which means that the right-hand side of (2.44) vanishes when u i = 0, i = 1, •••, N. Indeed, if the first member i = 1 satisfies (1.25), then u 1 = 0 follows directly. If it satisfies (2.15) instead of <ref type="bibr">(1.25)</ref>, u 1 = 0 still holds because the sum of the rows of D being zero implies, from (2.6), that</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">V (z, ξ ) = V f (z) +V b (ξ ) (2.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_79">u 1 = - N ∑ i=2 u i = 0.</formula><p>(2.45)</p><p>We thus conclude that u = 0, which means from (2.26) that ψ(z) lies in the null space N (D ⊗ I p ). Using the Invariance Principle, which states that all bounded solutions approach their positive limit set, which is invariant, we conclude that the trajectories converge to the set E in (2.33). When Property 2.1 holds, E coincides with A , which proves asymptotic stability of A with region of attraction G , while uniformity of asymptotic stability follows from the time-invariance of the (z, ξ )dynamics.</p><p>The Lyapunov function V (z, ξ ) in the proof above yields a negative semidefinite derivative. By using the observability condition in (2.12), we prove the stability results in Theorem 2.1. This Lyapunov function allows us to develop different adaptive schemes to enhance robustness of group motion. For example, in Chapters 3 and 4, we develop adaptive schemes that enable agents to estimate leader's mission plan v(t). These adaptive schemes relax the assumption in Theorem 2.1 that all the agents must have the v(t) information. In Chapter 6, where agreement of multiple Euler-Lagrange systems is studied, we attempt to design adaptive control laws from V (z, ξ ) to compensate for uncertainties in Euler-Lagrange systems. However, we illustrate with an example that the resulting adaptive design is not sufficient to ensure group objectives. This is because V is only negative semidefinite. We will detail in Chapter 6 how we overcome this insufficiency by exploiting the structure of Euler-Lagrange equations and the design flexibility offered by the passivity-based framework.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Distance-based Formation Control</head><p>In this section, we study the distance-based formation control problem defined in <ref type="bibr">(2.50)</ref>. In contrast to the position-based formation control, this problem concerns only the shape of the group formation. It will become clear that a key complication is that Property 2.1, which holds true in the position-based formation control, is no longer satisfied in the distance-based formation control with cyclic graphs. Thus, additional undesired equilibria may arise due to the cycles in the graph, making global stabilization of the desired formation impossible. In the special case of three agents, we show that the undesired equilibria are unstable. We then conclude generic convergence to the desired formation from almost all initial conditions.</p><p>We also explore existence and uniqueness of the formation shape in this section. The existence of a formation shape is related to the requirement in (2.7), which is further sharpened to sufficient conditions on the desired target sets. These conditions are generalizations of the triangle inequality. We explore the uniqueness issue using a four-agent example. If the shape of the desired formation is a rectangle, specifying desired relative distances of the four sides is not sufficient since the agents may reach a parallelogram instead. In this case, desired relative distances of the diagonal links must also be specified to ensure that the rectangle shape is the unique desired formation.</p></div>

As an example, consider a group of N agents that form a ring graph, i.e., each agent has exactly two neighbors. A ring graph has only one cycle and the numbers of links and nodes are the same, i.e., N = . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.11, we assign the orientation of the ring graph such that the positive end of each link is the negative end of the next link in the sequence.

(<label>2.116)</label></formula><p>When N = 3 and the desired formation is a triangle, (2.116) reduces to the triangle inequality, that is, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the length of the other side. Thus, the choice of d k is constrained by <ref type="bibr">(2.116)</ref>. If the graph contains multiple cycles, multiple constraints similar to (2.116) must be satisfied for d k 's so that a desired formation exists.</p><p>Once we establish that a desired formation exists for a given set of d k 's, the shape of the desired formation may not be unique if we do not specify enough number of desired relative distances. We illustrate this using a four-agent example below. More formal analysis on the uniqueness of a formation shape using "rigidity" can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. Suppose that we want to stabilize four agents to a rectangle formation (solid lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.12). Initially, we only specify the desired relative distances of the four sides. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.12, the agents may converge to a rectangle or to a parallelogram or even to a line since all those shapes are in the target set (2.50). In fact, there exist infinitely many formations (up to rigid translation and rotation) in (2.50).

The difference in these equilibria sets reflects different control objectives. When the agents need to maintain specific bearings and distances with respect to their neighbors, the position-based formation control is more suitable. In the case where cooperative tasks only require the shape of the formation rather than a specific orientation of the formation, the distance-based formation control is preferable. This is because the position-based formation control may put stringent constraints on relative positions and sacrifice the flexibility of the group motion, as we illustrate below.</p><p>Example 2.6. Consider a group of three agents x i ∈ R 2 , i = 1, 2, 3. Suppose that the desired formation is an equilateral triangle with side length 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Control Design and Stability.</head><p>The difference in equilibria leads to different control designs: The design in Section 2.7.1 employs nonlinear potential functions to achieve the distance-based formation control while position-based formation control can be realized by linear feedback laws, such as the design in <ref type="bibr">(2.74)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, because of the difference in equilibria sets, the distance-based formation control stabilizes the desired formation only locally when the graph contains cycles while the position-based formation control is able to globally stabilize the desired formation. This is because Property 2.1 is satisfied for the positionbased formation control but not for the distance-based formation control. Because the position-based formation control is globally stabilizable, it has been applied to different cooperative control problems, including formation control of unicycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</p><p>• Desired Formation Specification.</p><p>The difference in the equilibria sets (2.50) and (2.51) also results in different specifications of the desired formation. For example, consider four planar agents in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.16. The coordinate E is a global frame while</p><formula xml:id="formula_147">R i , i = 1, •••, 4, is agent i's local frame, possibly different from E.</formula><p>The desired formation is an equilateral square shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.16. To specify a desired formation using (2.50), one only needs to determine the desired relative distances, which is invariant in different frames. This implies that the desired distances can be specified in either E or R i 's. However, for position-based formation control, the desired relative position z d must be prescribed in one common frame, such as E in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.16.</p><p>One subtlety in specifying a desired formation is how to guarantee a unique desired formation. For position-based formation control, specifying desired relative positions of N -1 links is sufficient if these N -1 links can form a connected graph. This is because once the desired relative positions of these N -1 links are fixed, the desired relative positions between any two agents are also fixed. As an illustration, consider Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.16 and suppose that we specify the relative positions for the links between agents 1 and 2, between agents 2 and 3, and between agents 3 and 4. These three links form a connected graph and thus all the other relative positions, such as relative positions between agents 4 and 1, between agents 2 and 4, are uniquely determined. However, for distance-based formation control, specifying the desired lengths of N -1 links may not enough to ensure a unique formation, as we already illustrated in Example 2.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Implementation of Control Laws.</head><p>In practice, the relative position z k 's are obtained in each agent's local frame. If precise global frame information is available, the agents may transform the local measurements of z k to the global coordinates for implementation. However, in some applications, such as space interferometry sensing, the global frame information may be imprecise or unavailable. In this case, we show that distance-based formation control can be easily implemented without knowledge of any global frame information while position-based formation control requires the knowledge of a common frame in which the desired relative positions z d are specified.</p><p>For illustration, we assume double integrator dynamics for the agents and rewrite the control laws for distance-based and position-based formation control as</p><formula xml:id="formula_148">position-based: ẍi = τ i = -k i ẋi -∑ i=1 d ik (z k -z d k ) (2.117) distance-based: ẍi = τ i = -k i ẋi -∑ i=1 d ik log( |z k | d k ) 1 |z k | z k (2.118)</formula><p>where we take v(t) = 0 p . Suppose that (2.117)-(2.118) are written in a global frame E. Then z d k 's must be specified in E. When E is not available, each agent implements i τ i , the τ i vector represented in agent i's frame<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">2</ref> . Let R i be the agent i's frame represented in E. Then i τ i 's are given by position-based:</p><formula xml:id="formula_149">i τ i = -k i R T i ẋi -∑ i=1 d ik (R T i z k -R T i z d k ) (2.119) distance-based: i τ i = -k i R T i ẋi -∑ i=1 d ik log( |z k | d k ) 1 |z k | R T i z k . (2.120)</formula><p>It then becomes evident that both (2.119) and (2.120) require agent i's velocity represented in R i (i.e., the term R T i ẋi ) and the relative position z k represented in R i (i.e., the term R T i z k ). In addition, the position-based formation control also needs R T i z d k , which cannot be computed if the global frame E is not known. Thus, we conclude that distance-based formation control is more suitable for applications with no global frame information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9">Summary</head><p>In this chapter, we employed passivity as a design tool for a class of group coordination problems where the topology of information exchange between agents is bidirectional. We exploited the symmetry inherent in the undirected graph and represented it as a passivity-preserving structure (pre-multiplication of D T ⊗ I p and post-multiplication by its transpose as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.2). We used this structure to develop a passivity-based design framework that yields a broad class of decentralized and scalable cooperative control laws for complex and heterogeneous agent dynamics. In addition to stabilizing feedback rules, the passivity-based design framework constructs a Lur'e-type Lyapunov function. As we will illustrate in Chapters 3, 4 and 6, this Lyapunov function serves as a starting point for several adaptive designs that enhance robustness of group motion.</p><p>We next applied the passivity-based design framework to agreement problems. We developed a class of decentralized protocols that achieve agreement of agents. We also studied the position-based and the distance-based formation control. For the position-based formation control, we showed that it can be transformed to an agreement problem, which means that the desired formation is guaranteed. In the distance-based formation control, we showed that the desired formation is only locally asymptotically stable for cyclic graphs because Property 2.1 fails. We then proved the instability of the undesired formations for a three-agent example and concluded generic convergence to the desired formation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 3</head><p>Adaptive Design for Reference Velocity Recovery: Internal Model Approach</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Introduction</head><p>The passivity-based design in Chapter 2 assumed that the reference velocity of the group is available to each agent and developed control laws that made use of this information. A more realistic situation is when a leader, say agent 1, in the group possesses this information. In this chapter, we exploit the design flexibility offered by the passivity-based framework and develop adaptive designs with which the other agents reconstruct reference velocity information. We first illustrate with an example that if the agents do not have the same reference velocity information, objectives A1 and A2 cannot be guaranteed. Assuming that the reference velocity is constant or periodically time-varying, we then propose a basic adaptive design that allows the other agents estimate the reference velocity. This basic adaptive design preserves the passivity properties proven in Theorem 2.1 and recovers objective A2. The derivation of this adaptive design follows techniques from the regulation problem studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref> and is referred to as the internal model approach because this design contains a model of the dynamic structure of the reference velocity.</p><p>With the basic adaptive design, we next present an example which shows that the estimates of the reference velocity may not converge to their true value when the reference velocity is time-varying. This means that tracking of the reference velocity (objective A1) is not guaranteed. However, the basic adaptive design guarantees tracking of the reference velocity in several special cases, such as, when the reference velocity is constant, or when the desired target set is the origin.</p><p>In the situation where tracking of reference velocity fails for the basic adaptive design, we propose an augmented adaptive design to guarantee tracking of the reference velocity without the restrictions discussed above. The main idea in the augmented design is to ensure that the relative velocities between agents converge to zero, thereby guaranteeing that all agents converge to the reference velocity. By including the relative velocity feedback in the redesign, we recover the stability result of the basic adaptive design while achieving tracking of the reference velocity.</p></div>

In the following sections, we will propose adaptive designs with which the agents recover the reference velocity information and eliminate the steady state errors. In particular, we will present two approaches: the Internal Model approach and the Parameterization approach. The internal model approach assumes the reference velocity to be constant or periodically time-varying while the parameterization approach developed in Chapter 4 parameterizes the reference velocity as a linear combination of known time-varying basis functions with unknown constant coefficients.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">The Augmented Design</head><p>We now develop an augmented design that guarantees tracking of the reference velocity v(t). In the basic update law (3.29)-(3.30), vi stops updating when u i in (2.23) reaches zero. As shown in Section 3.4.2, however, u i = 0 does not mean that all the agents possess the same velocity v(t). Note that, in contrast, ż → 0 would (b)</p><formula xml:id="formula_204">(a)</formula><p>imply that all agents converge to the same velocity. Thus, in the augmented adaptive design we employ ż to guarantee tracking of the reference velocity. To present the augmented design, we introduce a static directed graph G v representing the information topology for the relative velocity: If the ith agent has access to the relative velocity information ẋiẋ j , then the nodes i and j in the graph G v are connected by a directional link from j to i and agent j is a neighbor of agent i. We denote by N v i the set of neighbors of agent i in G v .

It follows that ξ i = 0, ∀i ∈ I , u i = 0, ∀i / ∈ I and (y + ṽ) T (L v ⊗ I p )(y + ṽ) = 0. Applying the same analysis as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we conclude u = 0 on M . For dynamic block H i , we obtain from ξ i = 0, u i = 0, (2.11) and (2.13) that y i = 0. Likewise, the static block satisfies y i = h i (u i ), which implies that y i vanishes on M . Therefore, y i = 0 on M , ∀i. Recall from Property 1.4 that (y + ṽ) T (L v ⊗ I p )(y + ṽ) is zero only when (y + ṽ) T (L v sym )(y + ṽ) is zero. Since the graph G v is strongly connected, the graph corresponding to L v sym is connected. Therefore, (y + ṽ) T (L v ⊗ I p )(y + ṽ) = 0 implies y + ṽ = 1 N ⊗ c, where c ∈ R p . We then conclude from ṽ1 ≡ 0 and y 1 = 0 that |y + ṽ| = 0. Since y = 0, it follows that ṽ = 0, which implies from (3.49) that tracking of v(t) is achieved.

(4.5)</formula><p>In the following sections, we first develop a basic adaptive design with which agent i updates its estimate θi , i = 2, •••, N. Like the design in Section 3.3, this basic adaptive design recovers objective A2 as well as guaranteeing objective A1 in some special cases, such as, the agreement problem. To ensure objective A1 when the basic adaptive design fails, we then modify the basic adaptive design in a similar fashion to Section 3.5 and obtain the augmented adaptive design. We next apply the adaptive design result to an extremum seeking example. In this example, a group leader autonomously determines the Newton direction towards the extremum by sampling a field distribution and parameterizes the group reference velocity according to the Newton direction. The other agents then estimate this reference velocity using the basic adaptive design and reconstruct the desired formation during extremum seeking. Before proceeding to these results, we first compare the parameterization approach and the internal model approach.</p><p>In the parameterization approach, the availability of the basis functions to each agent is similar to Assumption 1 in the internal model approach, where the Ā matrix is available to each agent. The use of the basis functions φ j (t) removes the re- striction in the internal model approach that v(t) be constant or periodic. The basis functions may then be used to shape the transient of the reference velocity profile. However, since φ j (t)'s are time-dependent, the agents need to have synchronized clocks to implement this parameterization approach. The next example compares the number of the internal states used for estimating periodic reference velocity in these two approaches.</p><p>Example 4.1. We consider a scalar reference velocity v(t), parameterized by</p><formula xml:id="formula_217">v(t) = r 1 ∑ i=1 (a i sin(w i t) + b i cos(w i t)). (<label>4.6)</label></formula><p>Note that v(t) in (4.6) is already parameterized by the basis functions sin(w i t) and cos(w i t), i = 1, •••, r 1 . Therefore, the total number of unknown parameters that parameterizes this v(t) is 2r 1 , which means that for the parameterization approach, each agent (except the leader) needs to update 2r 1 internal states to estimate these unknown parameters.</p><p>In the internal model approach, we choose Ā in <ref type="bibr">(3.15)</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_218">Ā = diag 0 -w 1 w 1 0 , •••, 0 -w r 1 w r 1 0 (4.7)</formula><p>which implies that the dimension of ϖ i in (3.29) is 2r 1 . This means that each agent (except the leader) also maintains 2r 1 internal states to estimate the reference velocity. Thus, in estimating generic periodic reference velocities, both the parameterization approach and the internal model approach use the same number of internal states.</p><p>In some special cases, however, the parameterization approach may require less internal states. For example, if in (4.6) b i = 0, i = 1, •••, r 1 , then the parameterization approach only requires r 1 internal states which estimate all a i 's while the internal model approach still requires Ā to be the same as (4.7) and the dimension of ϖ i to be 2r 1 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Application to Gradient Climbing in Formation</head><p>In this section, we apply the adaptive design result to a gradient climbing problem, where the group leader performs extremum seeking for the field minima or maxima, while the other agents maintain a desired formation with respect to the leader. Keeping a group formation during the gradient climbing may be desirable for reliable inter-vehicle communication/sensing, drag reduction, safety in adversarial environments, etc.</p><p>To achieve gradient climbing in a field distribution, the leader takes a discretetime, optimization based extremum seeking approach. This extremum-seeking approach, illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.5, generates finite-difference approximations for the gra- dient and the Hessian of the field, by "dithering" sensor positions. The advantage of this local approximation is that only the leader needs sensing capabilities, and communication of sensed variables and geographic proximity of sensors are not necessary for generating approximate gradients. After the dither motion, the leader calculates a Newton direction towards the field extremum. Thus, the group reference velocity v(t) is determined autonomously by the leader, in the form of segments v k (t), t ∈ [t k ,t k+1 ], that are updated in every iteration k according to the next Newton direction. Since v(t) is not available to the other agents, they need to estimate this v(t) information to achieve a successful gradient climbing in the desired formation.</p><p>We let the leader parameterize its reference velocity as in (4.1) and apply the basic adaptive design in this chapter to ensure a desired group formation. During the dither motion of the leader, the other agents may turn off the velocity adaptation design so that they do not respond to the dither motion of the leader. Even if the adaptation is not turned off, we show with simulation results that if the Newton motion lasts sufficiently long, the followers respond only to the Newton motion while filtering out the dither component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1">Reference Velocity Assignment by the Leader</head><p>In this section, we present the extremum seeking scheme performed by the leader. The analysis of the motion of the group will be pursued in Section 4.5.2. The goal in extremum-seeking based gradient climbing is to search for and move towards the maximum of a field distribution with an unknown functional form. The leader has access only to the scalar field measurements, and constructs the approximate gradient and Hessian information of the field by finite-difference methods to compute a Newton direction. It then assigns an appropriate velocity along the computed Newton direction. It is important to note that this scheme locates the maxima without position measurements.</p><p>We first review basic optimization tools that are instrumental in the extremum seeking design. We assume that the field has a spatial distribution characterized by a twice continuously differentiable function F(x) : R 2 → R that has a unique maximum at x = x * . Note that we restrict our attention to fields only in R 2 , however, the results can be extended to R 3 as well by employing appropriate finite-difference approximations. Also note that if the function F(x) has multiple maxima, then the results can be modified to prove regional convergence to the local maximum. Because only field measurements are available to the leader, we approximate the gradient and Hessian of F(x) by one-sided finite-difference gradient, G k ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_258">∇F(x k ) ≈ G k [i] := F(x k + h k e i ) -F(x k ) h k (4.49)</formula><p>and Hessian, H k ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_259">∇ 2 F(x k ) ≈ H k [i, j] := 1 h 2 k F(x k ) + F(x k + h k e i + h k e j ) -F(x k + h k e i ) -F(x k + h k e j )<label>(4.50)</label></formula><p>where h k denotes the finite-difference "dither" size, and e i is the i th unit vector.</p><p>For an easier implementation, steepest descent may be preferable over Newton's Method; however, it is slower and does not provide a concrete convergence proof with nonvanishing step-size.

We consider the agent model in <ref type="bibr">(2.16</ref>) and the control design (2.17). We assume that the leader, say agent 1, does not receive external feedback u i from other members of the group, hence u 1 ≡ 0. Recall that (2.16) and (2.17) can be transformed to (2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref>) and (2.20).

As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.5, in the kth extremum-seeking iteration, the leader first moves in [1, 0], [-1, 1], and [0, -1] directions rapidly to take samples of the field F(x) and computes the approximate gradient G k and the Hessian H k as in (4.49)-(4.50), and then moves in the approximate Newton direction l k = H -1 k G k , and arrives at x k+1 = x k + l k . To prepare for an adaptive reference velocity estimation by the followers, we parameterize v(t) in a form similar to (4.1). For each motion segment we let the reference velocity have a fixed sinusoidal amplitude profile, with endpoints at zero, and change its direction between successive segments. We denote by v [i, j] and v N the dither velocity in the [i, j] direction, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_262">[i, j] ∈ {[1, 0], [-1, 1], [0, -1]},</formula><p>and the Newton velocity in l k direction, respectively.

Note that other continuous velocity profiles that vanish at t ∈ {t k + nt d , t k+1 }, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, along with their derivatives, are also applicable. The velocities in (4.55)-(4.58), when switched according to (4.53), achieve one iteration of extremum-seeing motion by driving the leader first to the appropriate "dither" positions and then to the next "Newton" position x k+1 . Theorem 4.4 below proves that the extremum seeking scheme converges to an O( h) neighborhood of the maximum x * , when h k ≤ h is as in Lemma 4.2, and |x(0)x * | is sufficiently small. Theorem 4.4. Let the field distribution F(x) be twice continuously differentiable with a unique maximum at position x = x * ∈ R 2 . Suppose the assumptions in Lemma 4.2 hold and h be as defined therein.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2">Gradient Climbing in Formation</head><p>We have shown that using the switching strategy in (4.53) with the reference velocity v(t) parameterized as in (4.55)-(4.58), the leader locates the extrema of the field. We next investigate how to design the motion of the other agents to achieve gradient climbing in a desired formation. As discussed in Section 2.6, we may pursue the position-based or distance-based formation control formulation. In either formulation, we note that the other agents do not have the knowledge of the reference velocity v(t) which changes after each iteration of extremum seeking. Therefore, the adaptive designs in Chapter 3 and this chapter can be applied to estimate the v(t) information. Since (4.55)-(4.58) are already parameterized as a product of a vector and a time-varying basis function, we will take the parameterization approach in this chapter. Then the dynamics of agent i, i = 2, •••, N are given by the basic adaptive design (3.24), (2.11), (4.4), and (4.8), where we assume that u i has already been designed according to the position-based or distance-based formation control formulation.

(4.63)</formula><p>In each motion segment, agent i employs the basic adaptive design in Section 4.2 to estimate θ by θi and reconstruct the desired formation. If t d and T are sufficiently large, the result in Theorem 4.1 implies that the desired formation is ensured during each motion segment. This means that the agents will follow both the dither and the Newton motions of the leader. However, if only the leader has the sensing ability, it may be desired that the other agents respond only to the Newton motion. This can be achieved by simply turning off the adaptation during the dither motion periods. Even if adaptation is not turned off, the other agents detect only the Newton motion if T is sufficiently larger than t d . To see this, we note from (4.53) that the average velocity of v(t) within one extremum seeking  iteration is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_273">v av := 1 Δ t k +Δ t k v(t)dt = 1 Δ l k . (4.64)</formula><p>Then if T is sufficiently large, Δ ≈ T and thus v av ≈ 1 T l k , which is indeed the average of v N (t) in (4.58) in one Newton motion period. This implies that for sufficiently large T , the dither motion is averaged out. Thus, we can choose a sufficiently large T to ensure that the other agents follow only the Newton motion within each extremum-seeking iteration. In fact, for large T , one can further reveal a time-scale separation behavior in the group motion and show that the convergence to the desired formation is achieved in the fast time scale, while the Newton motion is performed in the slow time-scale.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Introduction</head><p>The previous chapters modeled the agents as point robots and considered only position control. However, in numerous applications, the attitude of the agents plays an important role, which means that the agents must be modeled as rigid bodies. In this chapter, we study an attitude agreement problem where each agent has access only to the relative attitude with respect to its neighboring agents and to its angular velocity in its own body frame. An important application of attitude agreement is space interferometry, where spacecraft need to maintain the same attitude. It is important to note that we do not rely on inertial attitude measurements, which would require star tracker sensors that in practice are limited by their low-bandwidth. In contrast, relative attitude can be obtained by visual means and the angular velocity can be measured with a gyro.</p><p>To develop decentralized controllers for group alignment, we extend the passivitybased framework in Section 2.3 from the point-based robot formation control to attitude control problem. Because the inertial frame is not available to the agents, we represent the relative attitude in local body frames. The use of local body frames distinguishes the orientation coordination problem from the framework in Section 2.2, where the relative position is represented in the inertial frame.</p><p>We also draw on the earlier results on single rigid body attitude control <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>, which exploit inherent passivity properties of rigid body dynamics and quaternion kinematics. In particular, we present a quaternion-based decentralized controller that locally asymptotically stabilizes the desired equilibria in which all the rigid bodies possess the same attitude, and rotate at the reference angular velocity. The resulting closed-loop structure is similar to the structure in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.2. We further consider a situation similar to Chapters 3 and 4, where the reference angular velocity is available only to the leader. Following similar design techniques in Chapter 4, we develop a decentralized adaptive controller that estimates the reference angular velocity and recovers the convergence results of the nonadaptive design. Although the presenta-tion of the designs is based on the unit quaternion, we show that the same scheme is applicable to other parameterizations of SO(3).</p></div>

Theorem 5.1 below makes use of the passivity properties of the feedforward and the feedback paths in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.1, and analyzes stability properties of the origin in the {E ω , q v }-space. Before proceeding with this analysis, however, we point to an obstacle to the global convergence to the origin which arises when the graph contains cycles. To see this note that the set of equilibria for the closed-loop system in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.1 is given by: O = {(E ω , q 0 , q v )| E ω = 0, constraint (5.9) and (D ⊗ I 3 )q v = 0}, <ref type="bibr">(5.19)</ref> where E ω = 0 implies i ω i = ω d , which means that each agent achieves the refer- ence angular velocity. If the graph is acyclic, that is, if the columns of D are linearly independent, then the third constraint (D ⊗ I 3 )q v = 0 implies q v = 0, which is the desired relative attitude where all agents are aligned. However, when the graph contains cycles, the null space of (D ⊗ I 3 ) is nontrivial, and the set in (5. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref>) contains additional equilibria. In Theorem 5.1 below we prove that all trajectories converge to the equilibrium set O.</p><p>Theorem 5.1. For the agents i = 1, •••, N defined by the dynamics (5.10), the control laws (5.12) and (5.18) guarantee that the signals {E ω , q 0 , q v } converge to the set of equilibria in <ref type="bibr">(5.19</ref>) and the equilibrium {E ω , q 0 , q v } = {0, +1 , 0} is stable. If D is full column rank, that is, if the graph is acyclic, then q v → 0 and E ω → 0 as t → ∞.</p><p>Proof. We first make use of Lemma 5.1 and prove that the feedforward path in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.1 is passive from ω B to -u.

It then follows that all the signals (E ω , u, q 0 , q v ) are bounded. It then follows from Theorem B.5 that E ω → 0, that is | i ω i -ω d (t)| → 0. Next, we show that u → 0. To this end, we note that Δ ωi is continuous and uniformly bounded from (5.13) because the signals { ui , Δ ωi , i J i , ω d , ωd } are bounded and continuous. Since Δ ω i → 0 and Δ ωi is continuous and bounded, it follows from Theorem B.4 that Δ ωi → 0, which implies from (5.13) that u i → 0. Finally, we note from (5.18) that u → 0 means that q v converges to the null space N (D ⊗ I 3 ). In particular, if D is full column rank, which means there are no cycles in the graph, then N (D ⊗ I 3 ) = 0 and, thus, q v → 0.

In other words, the Jacobian that maps differential changes in s k to differential changes in the attitude matrix is singular for some orientations. For example, the vector quaternion (h k sin( θ k 2 )) and the Gibb's vector (h k tan( θ k 2 )) are singular when θ k = π. This singularity is not a physical one in the sense that relative attitude can not move in some direction. It is a mathematical deficiency due to the local nature of three-parameter representation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.9">Related Literature</head><p>The attitude coordination problem has been considered in a number of publications. For example, reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> discussed several coordinated attitude control strategies, such as a leader-follower strategy and a virtual desired attitude strategy, and illustrated by simulations the advantage of coordination in the presence of disturbances. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref> introduced a decentralized controller to achieve the convergence of each agent to the same commanded desired attitude. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, the authors introduced an attitude coordination algorithm applicable to a ring communication graph.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Introduction</head><p>In this chapter, we further extend the passivity approach from point robots to agents modeled as Euler-Lagrange systems. The Euler-Lagrange model is prevalently used to model multi-link robots and encompasses the double integrator model in (2.16) as a special case. We first apply the design techniques in Chapter 2 and present a nominal design that achieves the agreement of the agents. We next consider the case where the dynamics of each agent are subject to a class of parameterized uncertainty. Such uncertainty may come from unknown parameters in agent dynamics or external disturbances, such as wind and friction. We develop adaptive control laws that compensate for the uncertainty and achieve objectives A1 and A2. The closed-loop structure considered in this chapter is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.1, where the blocks of the network information flow and the agent dynamics are the feedforward and feedback subsystems in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.2, respectively.</p><p>To develop adaptive control laws, we draw on earlier results in single robot trajectory tracking and present two approaches. The first approach is motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, where a small cross term was added to a Lyapunov function to achieve adaptive trajectory tracking for single robot. Applying a similar approach to the agreement of multiple Euler-Lagrange systems, we obtain a Lyapunov function with a cross term of the storage functions in <ref type="bibr">(2.35)</ref>. Different from the Lyapunov function considered in Section 2.4, this Lyapunov function yields a negative definite derivative, which allows us to develop an adaptive design that recovers objectives A1 and A2 in the presence of uncertainty. The second approach explores the design flexibility offered by the passivity framework. We modify the nominal design by feeding forward the external feedback u to the velocity error y, which ensures that the Lyapunov function in Section 2.4 yields a negative definite derivative. The resulting closed-loop system takes a form similar to the controller in <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>, where a virtual reference trajectory was introduced for adaptive design of single robot trajectory tracking. In our problem, the virtual reference velocity for each agent is the aggregation of the differences between itself and its neighbors. The results in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.1 The passivity structure considered in this chapter. Individual agent dynamics are now subject to uncertainty, such as wind disturbance and uncertain parameters in agent model. We will develop adaptive control laws that compensate for the uncertainty and achieve objectives A1 and A2.</p></div>

As we will illustrate, this feedthrough term results in a closed-loop system similar to the celebrated Slotine-Li type system <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> for single robot tracking control. This approach yields better performance in convergence speed than the first approach but requires u information available for implementation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7">Summary</head><p>In this chapter, we studied the agreement of multiple Euler Lagrange systems with parameterized uncertainty. We presented two approaches to compensating for the uncertainty. The first approach relies on the inherent robustness of Euler Lagrange systems and employs the "adding cross term" technique. The second approach feeds forward the external feedback and takes a form similar to the Slotine-Li type controller. The second approach achieves a faster convergence than the first approach. However, relative velocity information must be available to implement the second approach.</p></div>

Following Corollary 2.1, we conclude that (7.9) ensures global asymptotic stability of the origin of (ξ , θ ), i.e., the agreement of θ i 's and (7.4) are achieved. Does (7.9) also guarantee z i → 0, i.e., does each agent track its prescribed path? To answer this question, we note that the closed-loop system (7.6) and (7.9) becomes a cascaded system in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.1. In Theorem 7.1 below we prove that Σ i in (7.6) is Input-to-State Stable (ISS) with respect to ω i . Stability of the closed-loop system then follows because a cascade of an ISS and a uniformly globally asymptotically stable system is uniformly globally asymptotically stable (see Theorem B.7 in Appendix B.6). Thus, each agent follows its desired path, that is, z i → 0. Theorem 7.1.

Thus, it follows from Theorem B.8 in Appendix B.7 that the system is ISS from ω i to z i with ρ(r) = 2p im δ gi r ε</p><p>. Since the origin of (ξ , θ ) is globally asymptotically stable by the design in Corollary 2.1 and Σ i is ISS with respect to ω i , it follows from Theorem B.7 that the origin of ( θ , ξ , z) is uniformly globally asymptotically stable.</p><p>Remark 7.1. The cascaded structure of Design 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.1 also allows us to apply the adaptive designs in Chapters 3 and 4 when only one agent has the v(t) information. Since the desired target set for θ is the origin, both adaptive designs in Corollary 3.1 and Theorem 4.2 ensure ω → 0 and the synchronization of θ i 's. Because the adaptive design cascaded to the Σ i blocks is globally uniformly asymptotically stable and because the Σ i blocks are proven to be ISS, it follows from Theorem B.7 again that the tracking error z converges to zero and the synchronized path following is achieved.</p></div>

In this case, the saturation constraint of agent 4 will cause steady state errors in the agreement of the path variables. This error is eliminated by employing integral feedback from relative path variables between neighbors. In Design 2, the effect due to the thruster saturation can be reduced with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control structure with limited integral and derivative effect, also known as a lead-lag controller with the  following transfer function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_471">H pid,i (s) = v i β i 1 + μ i s 1 + β i μ i s 1 + T d,i s 1 + α i T d,i s (7.73)</formula><p>in which v i &gt; 0, 0 ≤ T d,i ≤ μ i , 1 ≤ β i &lt; ∞, and 0 &lt; α i ≤ 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5">Summary</head><p>We applied the passivity-based agreement design in Section 2.5 to a formation tracking scheme where path following systems are synchronized by communicating path variables. The passivation designs offers the flexibility to consider several designs for synchronization where robustness and performance issues can be addressed. The first design only employs the information of the synchronization error and becomes a trajectory tracking control as the path variables reach agreement. The second design makes use of both path error and synchronization error and allows users to prioritize path convergence. We presented a design example that incorporated the basic adaptive design in Chapter 3 and that also explored the flexibility of the passivitybased design to reduce saturation effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Introduction</head><p>For the examples presented in previous chapters, the relative information between agents, such as relative distances/positions, relative path variables, is obtained through explicit information flow, including sensor measurements and direct communication. While such explicit information flow exists in many cooperative control applications, there are situations where the information flow is implicit. For example, suppose that several people move a table and only one person knows where to go. Then, even without explicitly talking to or seeing each other, those people are able to adjust their velocities and forces, and finally succeed in moving the table towards the target. In this example, the communication is implicit, and people receive the information (e.g., where to go, how fast to go) by feeling the contact forces and the trend where the table is going.</p><p>In this chapter, we consider a group of agents handling a flexible payload. These agents are modeled as point robots with double integrator dynamics. As the agents move, the payload may be squeezed or stretched, generating contact forces to the agents. The contact forces between the agents and the payload are modeled as gradients of nonlinear potentials that describe the deformations of the payload. Because all the agents are attached to the payload, the contact forces can be considered as implicit communication between the agents with the payload acting as the "medium". Our objective is to employ this implicit communication to design decentralized control laws such that the contact forces are regulated at some setpoints and that the agents and the payload move with the same constant velocity in the limit. We assume that the deformations of the payload are so small that the motion of the payload can be approximated as a rigid body. This assumption is reasonable when a rigid load is surrounded with bumpers or elastic materials. Another illustration of this assumption is multiple grippers grasping a rigid load, where the grippers possess compliance from installed flexible mechanisms.</p><p>Recall that the formation control designs in Sections 2.6 and 2.7 employ virtual attractive/repulsive force feedback between the agents. For our load transport prob-Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.1 Multiple agents are attached to a common flexible load. Initially the payload is undeformed and agent i is attached to the point a i . If the load is deformed by agent i, the position of agent i, x i , is different from a i and the deformation is approximated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_474">δ i = x i -a i . v x c r i x i a i δ i</formula><p>lem, the contact forces play the role of physical force feedback between the agents and the payload. With this idea in mind, we consider the case where a constant reference velocity is available to all the agents. We propose a decentralized controller that guarantees the force regulation and the velocity convergence of the agents and the payload. This controller, consisting of an internal velocity feedback and an external force feedback from the payload, exhibits a similar structure to the position-based formation control design in Section 2.6. Exploiting this similarity allows us to apply adaptive design techniques to the load transport problem. For example, when no reference velocity is predesigned, we employ the adaptive design results from Chapter 3 and augment the decentralized controller with an integral control term. The resulting control law recovers the traditional integral force control and ensures the agents to achieve the same constant velocity and the force regulation without explicit communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Problem Formulation</head><p>Consider N planar agents holding a common flexible load as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.1. Each agent is modeled as a point robot. Suppose that the load is initially undeformed and that agent i is attached to the load at the point a i , i.e., x i (0) = a i (0) = x c (0) + r i , where x c ∈ R 2 and x i ∈ R 2 are the inertial positions for the center of mass of the load and agent i, and r i is a fixed vector in the inertial frame. Assuming that the initial orientation of the load θ c is zero, we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_475">a i (t) := x c (t) + R(θ c )r i , R(θ c ) = cos θ c -sin θ c sin θ c cos θ c (8.1)</formula><p>whose kinematics are given by ȧi = ẋc + θc sin θ c -cos θ c cos θ c -sin θ c r i . (8.2)</p><p>Note that a i (t) represents the position where agent i is attached if the payload is undeformed at time t. As the agents move, however, the flexible payload may be squeezed or stretched and therefore x i (t) = a i (t). The deformation of the payload, approximated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_476">δ i = x i -a i , i = 1, •••, N,<label>(8.3)</label></formula><p>generates a reaction force f i to agent i. This reaction force f i must be zero when the payload is not deformed by agent i, i.e., when δ i = 0.

This assumption is reasonable when a rigid object is surrounded by deformable materials (e.g., bumper) and the agents are attached to those materials.

The control objective is to design F i in a decentralized way such that all the agents and the payload converge to the same constant velocity, while the contact forces on the load are regulated, i.e., f i maintained at a setpoint f d i . Because the load must move with a constant speed, f d i 's are subject to the following constraint:</p><formula xml:id="formula_484">N ∑ i=1 f d i = 0. (8.11)</formula><p>The setpoints f d i should also be chosen to satisfy desired properties, such as force closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, which ensures that the agents always squeeze the payload at the desired stage. This requires the knowledge of the payload geometry and the grasping points.</p><p>In the following sections, we consider the control design in two cases: first, a reference velocity v is predesigned and available to each agent; second, v is not available to each agent. The second case includes as a special case the situation where v is available only to the leader.</p></div>

For example, the agents may have a common velocity direction but have not agreed on how fast to go. In this case, it is important for the agents to reach a common velocity. To achieve this, we follow the results from Section 3.6 and develop an adaptive control with which each agent estimates the group velocity. We define vi as the velocity estimate for agent i and propose the following update law for vi :</p><formula xml:id="formula_496">˙v i = Λ i ( f d i -f i ) (8.25)</formula><p>in which Λ i = Λ T i &gt; 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.1">Hardware</head><p>The experimental testbed, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.3, consists of two PUMA 560 arms, each with a six-degree of freedom force/torque sensor mounted on the wrist. Two computers running xPC target perform the real time control of the two arms and the data acquisition is achieved using PCI interface boards. Those two xPC computers run at an update rate of 1 kHz and only do low level tasks. There is a user interface host computer that runs MATLAB and communicates with the control computers through an Ethernet cable using UDP. This configuration allows high level processing and control to be done on the host computer while the control computer implements the low level control loop.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.2">Implementation</head><p>Because the end-effector of the PUMA arm is of six-degree freedom, we consider it as a fully actuated agent. To simplify the implementation and reduce the effects due to the uncertainty of the arm inertia, we choose to implement the control laws on the kinematic level rather than the dynamic level. Motivated by a standard singular perturbation analysis of (8.17) for small m i , we obtain the following controller by setting the right hand side of (8.17) to zero (i.e., setting ẍi = 0) and solving for ẋi :</p><formula xml:id="formula_504">ẋi = Γ i ( f d i -f i ) + v, i = 1, 2<label>(8.35)</label></formula><p>where Γ i &gt; 0, x 1 and x 2 are the positions of the end-effectors of the right and the left PUMA arms. This controller can also be justified by treating the payload as a virtual massless spring and invoking a Lyapunov analysis of (8.35) with the Lyapunov function ∑ 2 i=1 P i (z i ). Likewise, for the adaptive design, we implement  </p><formula xml:id="formula_505">= Γ i ( f d i -f i ) + vi (8.36)</formula><p>and keep the update law of vi the same as <ref type="bibr">(8.25)</ref>. Once the force measurement f i is available, ẋi is computed from (8.35) or (8.36) and transformed to the joint velocities using the pseudoinverse of the manipulator Jacobian matrix, i.e., qi = J + i ẋi <ref type="bibr">(8.37)</ref> where qi is the joint velocity, and J + i is the pseudoinverse of J i that satisfies ẋi = J i qi . <ref type="bibr">(8.38)</ref> The joint positions for the next step are calculated from qi as</p><formula xml:id="formula_506">q i (k + 1) = q i (k) + T qi (8.39)</formula><p>where T = 0.001 sec is the sampling period. The next step joint position is then tracked by a low level PID controller.</p><p>Our experiments are performed in the following steps: Approaching. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.4(a), the two manipulators approach a light weight soccer ball, fed by a person, along the y direction. In this stage, we tune the positions and the orientations of the end-effectors so that they are aligned on the same line. Thus, their motions are restricted to the same plane. We also ensure that the end-effectors are normal to the contact surfaces and that the line connecting both end-effectors approximately passes through the center of the ball. This guarantees no rotational motion when the manipulators squeeze the ball in the next stage.</p><p>Static Holding. As the end-effectors reach the ball in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.4(b), we turn on the controllers in <ref type="bibr">(8.35)</ref> with v = [0 0] T m/s, which implies that the ball will be held statically and squeezed. The squeeze forces are along the y direction and their desired setpoints are chosen to be ±10 N, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_507">f d 1 = [0 -10] T N and f d 2 = [0 10] T</formula><p>N, thereby satisfying <ref type="bibr">(8.11)</ref>. These large desired squeeze forces help maintaining the grasp and reducing the rotational motion of the ball. In case that the squeeze force drops below a certain amount (6 N in the experiments), we increase the feedback gain Γ i to quickly drive f i back. To ensure that the end-effector does not slip on the contact surface, we discard the force measurements along the x direction, which means that only the squeeze forces are controlled. Once the squeeze forces reach the desired setpoints, we start to move the ball with several basic maneuvers as discussed below and evaluate the performance of the proposed controllers in these cases.</p><p>Moving the object. In this step, we examine the proposed controllers in the scenarios of moving with v available, estimation of v, and circular motion. In all cases, we set Γ i = Γ = 0.001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.2.1">Moving with v available</head><p>After the stage of static holding, we move the object along the x direction by assigning v = [0.02 0] T m/s to each end-effector. The force measurements from the sensors on the wrists are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.5. The squeeze forces are maintained at ±10 N at the stage of static holding (17.5 sec-30 sec) and oscillate more around ±10 N when the end-effectors start moving (30 sec-47.5 sec). This is partially due to the dynamic effects of the low level PID tracking controller that we ignored in the implementation. The trajectories of both end-effectors from 30 sec to 47.5 sec are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.6, where no significant rotational motion is observed. Moreover, we compute from Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.6 that the approximate average velocities along the x direction is 0.02 m/s, the same as v.</p></div>

We assign v = -[0 0.005] T m/s to the right PUMA while the left PUMA has no v information. Therefore, the left PUMA needs to implement the adaptive design (8.36) to estimate v. The initial estimate of the left PUMA v1 (0) is chosen as zero. Since the motion is along y direction, which is the squeeze direction, no rotational motion is generated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.6">Summary</head><p>In this chapter, we studied a motion coordination problem where a group of agents move a flexible payload. The contact forces, which describe the relative information between the agents and the payload, build up implicit communication in the group. When the desired constant velocity is available to each agent, we developed a decentralized controller that achieves the convergence to the reference velocity and the force regulation. We also considered the situation where the reference velocity is not available. We proposed an adaptive control that recovers the nonadaptive results. Both nonadaptive and adaptive control laws were compared to the formation control designs in Chapters 2 and 3. Experiments were performed and validated our designs.</p></div>

Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> employed screw theory to examine a system of two nonholonomic wheeled mobile manipulators holding a common load. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref> multigripper grasping was considered, where one of the grippers is rigid and the others are flexible with built-in linear springs, and stabilization control laws were developed to achieve both position and force control. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref> considered transporting large (possibly flexible) objects as an impedance control problem and performed experiments using multiple mobile robots with manipulators to validate their controllers. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> studied modeling and manipulating totally deformable objects and the solution is centralized and based on finite element model. Our model of the payload is different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> since we assume the payload to be a partially flexible object that deforms only around the grasping points while <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> considered the deformations of all particles on the flexible object.</p><p>• In contrast with the existing literature, we solved the load transport problem in a similar way to the position-based formation control problem. The goal of this chapter is to address in the same passivity-based framework the connection between the formation control problem, where the interaction force is virtual, with the multiagent load carrying problem, where the interaction force is physical.</p><p>• Expanding the dynamics (8.9) with the adaptive control law (8.25) and (8.26), we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_508">m i ẍi = -K i ( ẋi -vi d (0)) + m i ˙v i + f d i -f i + K i Λ i ( f d i -f i ) integral force control (8.43)</formula><p>which is of the integral force control form <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">145]</ref>. Such an integral force control has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref> to be robust with respect to small time delay in the force measurements.</p><p>• We have considered only translational motion of the agents and the payload in this chapter. This is a simplifying assumption, which allows us to illustrate in a basic form the connection between the formation control problem and the load transport problem. Indeed, if the grasp is rigid, the agents are capable to exert torques to the payload. Then the dynamics for the orientation of the payload become</p><formula xml:id="formula_509">I c θc = N ∑ i=1 r ic × f i + N ∑ i=1 τ i (8.44)</formula><p>where I c is the inertia of the payload, τ i is the torque transmitted to the payload from agent i, r ic = x ix c , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_510">r ic × f i = r x ic f y i -r y ic f x i , (8.45) in which r ic = [r x ic , r y ic ] T and f i = [ f x i , f y i ] T .</formula><p>Our assumption on pure translational motion means that τ i 's may be chosen to stabilize θ c to a constant. The design of τ i may require the information of r ic and θ c . Once θ c is stabilized, the remaining motion would be only translational. Therefore, the formulation in this chapter only reflects the translational part of the load transport problem. Caveats for Robustness</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1">Introduction</head><p>In this chapter we consider the position-based formation control design in (2.74) and investigate its robustness with respect to switching topology, link gain variation and unmodeled dynamics. For convenience, we rewrite (2.74) here</p><formula xml:id="formula_511">(M ⊗ I p )ẍ + (K ⊗ I p )ẋ + (L Δ ⊗ I p )x = 0<label>(9.1)</label></formula><p>where We first analyze (9.1) with switching topologies. Such switching may occur due to the vehicles joining or leaving a formation, transmitter/receiver failures, limited communication/sensor range, or physical obstacles temporarily blocking sensing between vehicles. For single integrator dynamics, switching topology has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103]</ref> and stability under arbitrary switching has been ascertained for classes of coordination algorithms. In contrast, for second order dynamics, we illustrate with an example that a destabilizing switching sequence that triggers instability exists. We then show that stability is maintained when switching is sufficiently fast or slow so that is does not interfere with the natural frequencies of the group dynamics.</p><formula xml:id="formula_512">M = diag{m 1 , •••, m N }, K = diag{k 1 , •••, k N }</formula><p>We next investigate stability properties when the link weights are perturbed by small sinusoidal oscillations. To illustrate this instability in its most basic form, we make a simplifying assumption that the perturbation is sinusoidal and transform the group dynamics into a form that reveals a parametric resonance mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. This transformation employs the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian and decouples the relative motion from the motion of the center of the agents. When mass inertia and damping terms are identical for all agents, we obtain decoupled Mathieu equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, which make parametric resonance explicit. For broader classes of mass and damping matrices, we obtain coupled Mathieu equations and discuss which frequencies lead to parametric resonance. Next, we show that sinusoidal perturbations do not destabilize the system if they are slow or fast enough. The sinusoidal perturbations studied in this situation are not necessarily the most commonly occurring ones in practice. However, they allow us to study worstcase scenarios to deepen the understanding of fundamental stability and robustness properties in cooperative systems.</p><p>We finally study the effect of input unmodeled dynamics, such as fast actuator dynamics. Following standard singular perturbation arguments, we prove that the stability of the nominal design that ignores the effects of unmodeled dynamics is preserved when the stable unmodeled dynamics are sufficiently fast. As we illustrate with an example, how fast the unmodeled dynamics must be is dictated by the graph structure and the mass inertia matrix.</p></div>

It then follows from standard results in switching systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref> that, if the damping k is small, and if δ λ j 1 &lt; 1 and δ λ j 2 &gt; 1, then (9.3) is destabilized by a switching sequence that selects i = 1 when d T j ḋ j &gt; 0 and i = 2 otherwise. Instability with this sequence follows from the Lyapunov-like function V = d j 2 + ḋ j 2 which increases along the trajectories of (9.3). Because the eigenvalues λ 2 i and λ 3 i switch between the values 2 and 4 in our example, if δ ∈ (1/4, 1/2), then δ λ j 1 &lt; 1 and δ λ j 2 &gt; 1 indeed hold for j = 2, 3. This means that, when the damping is small, a destabilizing switching sequence exists.</p><p>We demonstrate this instability with a simulation in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>.1. We choose p = 1 and four agents. Although the system (9.1) guarantees agreement of x i 's for any fixed connected graph, when the communication topology switches between a complete graph and a ring graph according to the sequence described above, Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>.1 shows that the relative distances between the agents diverge.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2.2">Comparison with First-order Agent Models</head><p>The instability example presented in the previous section occurs only when the agent dynamics are second or higher order. In this section, we show that for agents modeled as first order integrators, switching between connected graphs will not lead to instability. In fact, the agreement of x i 's can be achieved even if the graph loses connectivity pointwise in time. Note that for first order agents, the H i 's in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2</ref>.2 are simply static passive blocks. We then restrict our attention to the following class of first order agreement protocols ẋi </p><formula xml:id="formula_515">= - M ∑ k=1 d ik (t) ψ k (z k ) z k := N ∑ j=1 d jk (t)x j , (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_516">λ 2 {L(t)} ≥ σ c &gt; 0 ∀t ≥ 0 (9.8)</formula><p>for some constant σ c &gt; 0 that does not depend on time, then it is not difficult to show that x i 's in (9.5)-(9.6) reach an agreement despite the time-varying L(t). We now prove agreement under a less restrictive persistency of excitation condition which stipulates that graph connectivity be established over a period of time, rather than pointwise in time:</p><p>Proposition 9.1. Consider the system (9.5)-(9.6) where x ∈ R pN comprises of the components</p><formula xml:id="formula_517">x i ∈ R p , i = 1, •••, N concatenated as in (2.</formula><p>3), ψ(•) satisfies <ref type="bibr">(2.46)</ref>, and D(t) is piecewise continuous incidence matrix. Let S be an (N -1) × N matrix with orthonormal rows that are each orthogonal to 1 N ; that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_518">S1 N = 0 SS T = I N-1 .

The "persistency of excitation" condition (9.10) means that SL(t)S T is nonsingular when integrated over a period of time, and not necessarily pointwise in time. Since, by construction of S in (9.9), SL(t)S T inherits all eigenvalues of L(t) except the one at zero, its smallest eigenvalue is λ 1 {SL(t)S T } = λ 2 {L(t)}, <ref type="bibr">(9.11)</ref> which means that nonsingularity of the matrix SL(t)S T is equivalent to connectivity of the graph. Because Proposition 9.1 does not require nonsingularity of SL(t)S T pointwise in time, it allows the graph to lose pointwise connectivity as long as it is established in the integral sense of (9.10). The pointwise connectivity situation (9.8) is a special case of Proposition 9.1 because, then, (9.10) readily holds with α = σ c δ .</p></div>

Since (9.1) guarantees the origin of (ẋ, z) to be exponentially stable for a fixed connected graph, using the concept of dwell-time <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, we can ensure ẋ → 0 and z → 0 if all graphs in the switching sequence are connected and if the interval between consecutive switchings is no shorter than some minimum dwell time τ &gt; 0, where estimates for τ can be obtained following <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.

Because the linear combination (9.18) preserves the structure of a Laplacian, L av Δ defines an average graph obtained by superimposing the individual graphs i = 1, •••, n. In this average graph, the links are weighted by τ i /T , which represents the relative dwell time of each graph constituting the average. This means that, if the time-varying graph is jointly connected as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, then the averaged graph described by L av Δ is connected. We point out that the connectedness of L av Δ also satisfies the persistency of excitation condition in (9.10) with δ = T since for all t 0 ≥ 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_528">t 0 +T t 0 SL σ (t) Δ S T dt = SL av Δ S T , (<label>9.19)</label></formula><p>which is positive definite if and only if the average graph is connected. We finally show that, when T is sufficient small, connectedness of the average graph implies stability of (9.12)-(9.13). To see this, note from (9.16) that the eigenvalues of Ξ (T, 0) are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_529">κ i = 1 + T λ i + O(T 2 ), i = 1, •••, 2N,<label>(9.20)</label></formula><p>where λ i 's are the eigenvalues of A av . It follows that if the graph induced by the averaged Laplacian L av Δ is connected, then all λ i 's have negative real parts, except the one, say λ 1 , at zero. This zero eigenvalue results from the null space of A av , spanned by a = [1 T N 0 T N ] T , which is also the null space of A i , i = 1, •••, n. We thus conclude that Ξ (T, 0)a = a, which implies κ 1 = 1. Then, for sufficiently small T , κ i in (9.20), i = 2, •••, 2N, remain inside the unit circle and κ 1 = 1 corresponds to the motion of the center, thereby guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the subspace spanned by a = [1 T N 0 T N ] T . Note that convergence to this subspace guarantees ẋ → 0 and z → 0. Lemma 9.1. Consider the closed loop dynamics (9.12)-(9.13) with a switching signal σ (t) of period T .

It then follows from standard singular perturbation arguments (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr">Example 11.14]</ref> reviewed in Appendix B.11) that there exists ε * such that for ε &lt; ε * , the origin of (ẋ, z) is asymptotically stable.</p><p>To illustrate the dependence of ε * on the graph and the mass inertia, we simplify the model in ( </p><formula xml:id="formula_539">⎛ ⎝ ẋ ẍ ξ ⎞ ⎠ = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ ⎝ 0 N I N 0 N 0 N 0 N I N -δ ε (M -1 L) -k ε I N -1 ε I N ⎞ ⎠ A ⊗I p ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ x ẋ ξ ⎞ ⎠ .

For sufficiently small ε, (9.61) is satisfied and guarantees stability despite the unmodeled dynamics. Denoting m min = min i m i , we note that a conservative upper bound of λmax is N m min , which implies from (9.61) that if ε &lt; km min δ N , the origin of (ẋ, z) is stable. Note that, since λmax is the maximal eigenvalue of M -1 L, ε * depends not only on the graph structure, but also on the mass distribution of the agents. To illustrate this dependence, we consider four agents with k = 2, δ = 1 and p = 1. We compare ε * 's under two graphs as in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>.2. When M = diag{5, 3, 2, 1}, we compute from (9.61) ε * = 1.4797 for the star graph and ε * = 0.8154 for the string graph, which means that the star graph is more robust for this M. However, when M = I 4 , ε * = 0.5, 0.5858, respectively, for the star graph and the string graph, which implies that the star graph is now less robust.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.5">Summary</head><p>In this chapter, we investigated robustness of (2.74) with respect to switching topology, link gain variation and unmodeled dynamics. We illustrated with an example that switching topology can lead to instability and showed that the closed-loop stability is maintained when switching is sufficiently fast and periodic. As a comparison, we also demonstrated that first order agreement protocols have the stability robustness with respect to switching topology. We next revealed a parametric resonance mechanism by transforming the cooperative system with time-varying link gains into Mathieu equations. As in the case of switching graphs, stability is maintained when the sinusoidal perturbation is slow or fast enough that it does not interfere with the natural frequencies of the group dynamics. We finally showed that for fast stable input unmodeled dynamics, the stability of the nominal design is preserved. Robustness of cooperative control protocols is an area that requires further investigation. Besides the three instability mechanisms presented in this chapter, other instability mechanisms should be revealed and robust redesigns need to be developed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_542">||G k -∇F(x k )|| 1 ≤ 1 2 γ 1 h k (A.11) ||H k -∇ 2 F(x k )|| 1 ≤ 5 3 nγ 2 h k .

The minimal number of parameters that represents SO(3) is 3 since there are 3 free parameters in the attitude matrix. We will present a class of three-parameter representations of SO(3), including Euler-Rodriguez parameters, Modified Gibb's vector, and vector quaternion. This class of parameterizations all consists of the equivalent axis and angle defined by the Euler Rotation Theorem below:</p><p>Theorem B.11 (Euler Rotation Theorem).

If s is the Gibb's vector, γ(θ ) = tan θ 2 and J s (s) becomes unbounded at θ = π, which means that s is unbounded.

Indeed, Y 3 = 0 leads to (D T ⊗ I p ) ṽ(t) = 0, which indicates that ṽ(t) lies in N (D T ⊗ I p ). Recall that N (D T ⊗ I p ) = 1 N ⊗ c, c ∈ R p and ṽ1 ≡ 0 p . Therefore, it follows that ṽ(t) = 0, which means that the second term in Y 4 (4.38) is zero. Likewise, from(2.46), Y 2 = 0 results in z = 0, which means z belongs to the desired set A and thus ψ(z) and u are zero. It follows that θ = 0 from (4.11), which shows that the third term in Y 4 vanishes.</figDesc></figure>

This PE condition ensures the information richness of the time-varying signal Φ(t) throughout time, and guarantees parameter convergence: Theorem 4.2. In Theorem 4.1, suppose that the desired sets are A k = {0}, and that the passive feedback block is of the form (4.20)-(4.22).

Parameter convergence is sufficient but not necessary for velocity tracking (compare (4.1) and (4.4)). We next show that velocity tracking implies parameter convergence θi → θ when the regressor Φ(t) satisfies the PE condition in (4.23). We need the following lemma. R n and f (X,t) : R n ×R ≥0 → R n . If all trajectories X(t) satisfy f (X(t),t) → 0 and Ω (t) T X(t) → 0, where Ω (t) ∈ R n is bounded and satisfies the PE property in(4.23), then X(t) → 0.

Note that, we want |x 1x * | ≤ ε as well, hence ν, h and ε must satisfy: B.3 Barbalat's Lemma Theorem B.3 (Barbalat's Lemma). Let f (t) : R → R be a uniformly continuous function on [0, ∞). Suppose that lim t→∞ t 0 f (s)ds exists and is finite. Then f (t) → 0 as t → ∞. (B.3) Barbalat's Lemma leads to the following convergence result: Theorem B.4. Let ξ (t) : R → R be a continuous function defined on [0, ∞). If ξ (t) → 0 as t → ∞ and ξ (t) is bounded, then ξ (t) → 0 as t → ∞. Proof. Let ξ (t) be the f (t) in Theorem B.3. Then lim t→∞ t 0 f (s)ds = lim t→∞ ξ (t)ξ (0) = -ξ (0). Because ξ is bounded, ḟ (t) is bounded and thus f (t) is uniformly continuous. The assumptions in Theorem B.3 are satisfied and it follows thatf (t) = ξ (t) → 0 as t → ∞.When applying Barbalat's Lemma to the Lyapunov analysis of nonautonomous systems, we have the following result:Theorem B.5. Suppose f (t, x) is piecewise continuous in t and locally Lipschitz in x, uniformly in t, on [0, ∞) × R n . Furthermore, suppose f (t, 0) is uniformly bounded for all t ≥ 0. Let V : [0, ∞) × R n → R be a continuously differentiable function such that W If (B.7) is passive with a C 2 storage function S(x), then it has relative degree one at x = 0.The result in this proposition means that the matrix L g h(0) := ∂ h(x) ∂ x x=0 g(0) is invertible if (B.7) is passive. For Δ ≥ 0, define B(Δ ) := {x ∈ R n |0 ≤ |x| ≤ Δ }.Under the following assumptions, the origin of (B.8) is uniformly globally asymptotically stable.Assumption 1: The origin of (B.8) is uniformly globally stable. Assumption 2: There exist integers j, m &gt; 0 and for each Δ &gt; 0 there exist• a number μ &gt; 0; • locally Lipschitz continuous functions V i : R ≥0 × R n → R, i ∈ {1, •••, j}; • a function φ : R ≥0 × R n → R m ; • continuous functions Y i : R n × R m → R, i ∈ {1, •••, j}; such that, for almost all (t, x) ∈ R ≥0 × B(Δ ), and all i ∈ {1, •••, j} max {|V i (t, x), φ (t, x)|} ≤ μ (B.9) Vi (t, x) ≤ Y i (x, φ (t, x)). [0, ∞) × R n 1 × R n 2 → R n 1 and f 2 : [0, ∞) × R n 2 → R n 2 arepiecewise continuous in t and locally Lipschitz in x = x 1 x 2 . Theorem B.7. Under the stated assumptions, if the system (B.11), with x 1 as input, is Input-to-State Stable (ISS) and the origin of (B.12) is globally uniformly asymptotically stable, then the origin of the cascade system (B.11) and (B.12) is globally uniformly asymptotically stable.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="5">B.5 Nested Matrosov Theorem [85, Theorem 1]</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="5">Theorem B.6 (Nested Matrosov Theorem).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> <ref type="bibr">Chapter 7</ref> <p>Synchronized Path Following</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Introduction</head><p>So far, we have focused on the formation control problem-maintaining the desired formation towards a common goal. For reconnaissance missions or maneuvering around obstacles, additional requirement of following a specified path may be required. The primary goal in path following problems is to design control laws that force the output of a system to follow a desired path. The secondary goal for the system is to obey a speed assignment along the path. In particular, we will consider the formulation where we parameterize the desired path by a path variable θ , and assign a desired speed to be achieved by θ as t → ∞. Unlike the classical tracking problem, where the speed assignment must be fulfilled for all t ≥ 0, the path following problem offers flexibility to shape the transient behavior of θ .</p><p>In this chapter, we exploit this flexibility to synchronize the path variables for a group of path-following systems. When the path variables reach agreement, the group exhibits a desired formation. Note that this synchronized path following approach achieves the desired formation through coordinated tracking of individual trajectories. This is different from the formulations in position/distance-based formation control studied in Sections 2.6 and 2.7, where the desired formation is achieved by controlling relative configurations. To synchronize the path variables θ , we apply the agreement schemes in Section 2.5 and obtain two synchronized path following designs. In the first design, the agreement schemes in Section 2.5 and the path following systems constitute a cascaded system. Because the agreement schemes are globally asymptotically stable, we demonstrate the closed-loop stability of this cascaded system by showing that the path following systems are Input-to-State Stable (ISS). In the second design, we will represent the closed-loop system as the feedback interconnection of a dynamic block for path variable agreement and another block that incorporates the path following systems. Since the agreement block is passive, we prove closed-loop stability by showing the path following systems are also passive, thereby satisfying Structure 3 in Section 1.5. We consider V f and V b in (2.35) and the following storage function</p><p>We obtain from (2.6) and (3.72)</p><p>We compute Vf as</p><p>The time derivative of V b is given in <ref type="bibr">(2.40)</ref>. Using Lemma 3.1, we obtain</p><p>which proves the boundedness of (z(t), ξ (t), ϖ(t)). We next apply the Invariance Principle and analyze the largest invariant set where V = 0. Applying the same analysis as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we conclude from V = 0 that ξ = 0 and A Proofs u = 0, which proves the convergence of (z(t), ξ (t)) to E , where E is as in <ref type="bibr">(2.33)</ref>. In particular, when Property 2.1 holds, u = 0 means z k ∈ A k and thus all trajectories (z(t), ξ (t)) starting in G converge to the set A .</p><p>If condition 1 or 2 in Corollary 3.1 holds, u = 0 implies ż = (D T ⊗ I p ) ẋ = 0. From (3.72) and the fact that N (D T ) is spanned by 1 N , we further obtain | vi (t)v(t)| → 0 for some v(t).</p><p>If in (3.29)-(3.30), B i = B, we note that</p><p>whose time derivative is </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Proof of Corollary 3.3</head><p>The proof is similar to Appendix A.1.

It follows that</p><p>where we recall that</p><p>) is positive semidefinite and has the only null space spanned by 1 N if G v is strongly connected and balanced.</p><p>Using the Invariance Principle, we further prove ξ → 0, y → 0, u → 0 and | viv j | → 0. The rest of the proof mimics the proof in Appendix A.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3 Proof of Lemma 4.2</head><p>To prove Lemma 4.2 we use standard tools in multivariable calculus, and the results in unconstrained optimization theory. We let γ 1 and γ 2 be the Lipschitz constants of ∇F(x) and ∇ 2 F(x), respectively, for x ∈ D ⊆ R 2 . Then, the finite difference approximations in (4.49) and (4.50) satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch.5]</ref> A Proofs</p><p>We thus pick h as</p><p>which is feasible when ν &lt; 1 2 .

If h, ε, and ν are selected such that (A.13), (A.18), (A.19) are satisfied, then</p><p>and (A.14) and (A.15) hold for H 1 as well. Induction on k + 1 goes similarly, and yields</p><p>where c := ν 1-ν and δ</p><p>A.4 Proof of Theorem 5.2</p><p>We denote by βi the error variable</p><p>T and note from (5.55) that</p><p>For consistency, we set β1 ≡ 0. We then rewrite (5.10), (5.53) and (5.54) as</p><p>To prove the stability of the closed loop system described by the adaptive scheme (A.23), (A.24), (5.18) and (5.55), we investigate the passivity properties of the interconnected system.

The negative semidefinite derivative Va implies that the trajectories {q <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref>. By taking the derivative of (A.23) and (A.24), we note that Δ ω1 and Δ ω i are continuous and uniformly bounded because the signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref>) and (A.24). Using argu- ments similar to those in the proof for Theorem 5.1, we conclude that q v converges to the null space of D ⊗ I 3 . Suppose that q v → 0. In this case, we note from (5.6) and (5.3) that D → (-D ⊗ I 3 ) and DT → (-D T ⊗ I 3 ). On the other hand, since qv , q0 and ω are all bounded and continuous signals, then from (5.7) we conclude that qv is also bounded and continuous. From Theorem B.4, we obtain qv → 0. Next we prove ω → 0. This follows because qv → 0 and because the Jacobian from ω to qv in (5.7) is always A Proofs full rank. Therefore, from (5.4) we conclude that ω B converges to</p><p>A.5 Proof of Proposition 8.1</p><p>We take the following energy-motivated Lyapunov function</p><p>where P i (z i ) is defined in (8.24), and ξ i and ξ c are as in <ref type="bibr">(8.13)</ref>. From Lemma 8.1, the first term in (A.29) is positive definite. Then, the time derivative of V yields</p><p>From (8.2), (8.4) and the assumption θc = 0, the kinematics of z i are given by żi = ẋiȧi = ẋiẋc . (A.31)</p><p>We next rewrite (A.30) from (8.9), (8.10), <ref type="bibr">(8.11)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(8.16</ref>) and (A.31) as</p><p>which implies the stability of the equilibrium E .</p><p>To conclude the asymptotic stability, we apply the Invariance Principle and investigate the largest invariant set M where V = 0, i.e., ξ i = 0. From (8.13), we note that ξ i = 0 implies that ẋi = v. We further obtain from ξi = 0 that ẍi = 0, which leads to F i = f i from (8.9). Thus, it is clear from <ref type="bibr">(8.16</ref>) that f d i = f i . We now show that on M , ẋc = v. To see this, we note that</p><p>Since z d i is constant, we have żi = 0 on M , that is, from (8.4), ẋi = ȧi . Because we consider only the translational motion and because ẋi = v on M , we conclude that ȧi = ẋc = v.</p><p>A.6 Proof of Proposition 8.2</p><p>We choose the following Lyapunov function</p><p>where ξ i is defined in <ref type="bibr">(8.27)</ref>. The time derivative of V 1 is given by </p><p>We next apply the Invariance Principle and investigate the largest invariant set M * where V1 = 0. On M * , V1 = 0 means ξ i = 0 and thus ξi = 0, which further implies from (8.29) that f i = f d i . Then, from (8.25), ˙v i = 0. It follows from ẍi = ˙v i = 0 that ẋi is constant on M * . Since ḟi = ḟ d i = 0 and żi = ẋiẋc , we conclude ẋi = ẋc , ∀i, which means that all the agents and the payload have the same constant velocity. Noting from (8.27) and ξ i = 0, we further obtain ẋc = vi , i = 1, •••, N.</p><p>Next, from (8.10) and (8.25), we compute</p><p>We rewrite (A.38) as</p><p>and note from (8.11), (A.37) and (A.39) that A Proofs</p><p>Because on M * , ẋc and vi are equal and constant, we obtain from (A.41) that ẋc = ẋi = vi = v, where v is in <ref type="bibr">(8.32)</ref>.</p></div>

Theorem B.2. Let Ω ⊂ D be a compact set that is positively invariant with respect to the following dynamical system</p><p>where f :</p><p>be the set of all points in Ω where V (x) = 0. Let M be the largest invariant set in E. Then every solution starting in Ω approaches M as t → ∞.</p><p>Other parameterizations, such as Euler angles and roll-pitch-yaw angles, are also commonly used in literature. However, only the parameterization in (B.28) is discussed in this section since it is closely related to Chapter 5. The representation (B.28) can be uniquely determined for almost all R ∈ SO(3). Since (B.28) relates to the equivalent axis/angle, we first present how to obtain (h, θ ) from a given R ∈ SO <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><p>The relationship between the rotation matrix R and (h, θ ) is given by the Rodriguez formula</p><p>where is defined in <ref type="bibr">(1.5)</ref>. We obtain from (B.32) that</p><p>where tr(R) is the trace of R and ∨ is the inverse operation of defined in <ref type="bibr">(1.6)</ref>. By manipulating the diagonal elements of R, we can find an expression for the ith element of h:</p><p>where R i j denotes the (i, j)th element of R. The computation of (B.36) breaks down when tr(R) = 3, that is, R = I 3 , which implies from (B.33) that θ = 0. In this case, h can be an arbitrary unit vector. Once h is obtained, we compute θ from (B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref>). Note that (B.36) gives two solutions to h, which results in two solutions to (B.35). These two solutions correspond to the two possible direction of rotation to achieve the same end result. We can also verify from (B.32) that both (θ , h) and (-θ , -h) yield the same R.</p><p>The parameterization (B.28) can be readily obtained from h and θ . Thanks to the odd function γ(•), (θ , h) and (-θ , -h) yield the same parameterization s. Thus, for almost all R ∈ SO(3), one can uniquely determine a three parameterization s from (θ , h) and (B.28). In certain cases, for example when θ = π and γ(θ ) = tan θ 2 , (B.28) is not well defined. This is because all three-parameter representations of SO( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) are only locally one-to-one and onto. As we will present in the next section, there are always singularities for three-parameter representations of SO(3). This singularity issue can be eliminated by using unit quaternion, which uses the least possible number of parameters (4) to represent the orientation globally. Besides, unit quaternion is of great interest due to its desirable computational properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>.</p><p>A unit quaternion q consists of a scalar part q 0 and a vector part q v ∈ R 3 , which can be defined through (θ , h) as</p><p>It follows that |q| = q 2 0 + q T v q v = 1. Thus, q is a four-parameter representation of SO(3) with one constraint.
