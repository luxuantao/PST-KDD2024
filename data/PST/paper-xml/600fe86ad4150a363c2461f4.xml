<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Social networking sites (SNS) are designed to enhance people's social experiences through the sharing of information and creating opportunities to express emotional responses to events, situation, and other users' postings <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Li et al. 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mayshak, Sharman, and Zinkiewicz 2016)</ref>. Users register virtual profiles and use them to communicate with others online and avatars (or profile image, profile photo, etc.) are available to be selected and uploaded by a social media user. The avatar potentially serves as a window to the user's interests and values. Therefore, the avatar image may provide meaningful deeper understanding of information diffusion in social media platforms such as twitter through avatar analysis, which is focused by the academic community. In other words, the choice of avatars is believed to be associated with various individual/personal characteristics of the avatar owner, such as psychological state, personal preferences, or usage motives on Twitter which affect their overall behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wang et al. 2018)</ref>. This can help predict/understand users general behaviour and information diffusion (behaviour in terms of posting/reposting tweets or replying tweets, preferred tweets) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Toma 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bergsma et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhao and Jiang 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Shu et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To date, user profiling technologies have been limited in the ability to capture a user's character when they have not been very active on social media. For example, a new user or one who has just registered may not have much online history. Information gleaned from profiles could provide a greater sense of the user. A user's avatar in an SNS may reveal the image a person wants to present to the online community <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wei and Stillwell 2017)</ref>. More importantly, profile analysis using avatar images permits researchers to discover user-specific characteristics. This could enable computers to anonymously identify user groups that have similar attributes or behaviours. This feature-based automatic identification could have a variety of uses; in particular it would permit an ability to create large samples of users with common interests. Therefore, the analysis of a user's avatar selection through the collection of large amounts of users' data could contribute to the identification, as well as the classification, of user groups and enhance the study of user profiles.</p><p>In an eCommerce industry, such avatar involved profiling technology could make a more major contribution to establish precise business service, such as personalised advertisement, implicit customer community discovery, and suspicious user detection. From the view of market management, social media-based profiling including avatarrelated behaviour is a promising opportunity to understand innermost being of potential customers; while from the angle of research, this social media-based study could help to establish better personalised recommendation model as well as user detection model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Senadheera, Warren, and Leitch 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Song, Jamous, and Turowski 2019)</ref>.</p><p>However, the relationship between avatars and user activities/behaviour is not well understood yet. In addition,the sample sizes that have been used in this type of research has ranged from 300 to 1000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Toma 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhao and Jiang 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tominaga and Hijikata 2015)</ref>. Because the sample sizes are so small in comparison to the total population of users, there is a risk of bias. Moreover, all of the research has relied upon manual data entry, making it difficult to compile large sets of data. Consequently, the establishment of an automated method to collect data to classify user information could provide a rapid means by which to classify results and obtain a high degree of accuracy: The researcher would only need to screen the results and correct any errors. This would reduce the workload demanded for studies of this nature and thereby save time.</p><p>Furthermore, based on a large comprehensive dataset, incorporating avatar into intelligent model as an additional feature can eventually help information provider to precisely identify a certain type of users or detect suspicious accounts. To the best of our knowledge, combining user's avatar selections into intelligent prediction models is a novel aspect towards accurate user community identification and profiling.</p><p>Facing the aforementioned motivations and challenges, in this paper, we made an initial attempt to identify special or suspicious type of SNS users by incorporating users avatar information. First, to overcome the problem of lack of avatar datasets, we propose a semi-automatic bootstrapping-like method for labelling avatars based, thus achieving a labelled avatar dataset with the amount lager than 100,000. Second, we investigated the relationship between user avatar selection and SNS behaviour, in order to find potential distinguishable feature for user group and community identification. Third, we also establish a classification to identify small Sellers on Social Media (SSM) as a case study to validate our proposed approach.</p><p>The contributions of this paper are summarised as follows:</p><p>(1) A bootstrapping-like method with a Convolutional Neural Network is proposed to semi-automatically label users' avatars into 13 pre-defined categories, thereby forming an avatar dataset with 103,112 records. The accuracy of the semi-automated labelling model finally derives is 81.03%.</p><p>(2) The relationship between users avatar selection and user behaviour including FF score, the number of comments, retweets, likes, and the distribution of gender and ages are studied, thereby finding the behavioural specificity of different avatar types. Some special types of avatars are also discussed with their typical behaviours.</p><p>(3) based on the dataset and features derived from the previous two steps, we establish an experiment in identifying SSM users on Weibo platform as a case study, thereby validating the practicability of our proposed approach. Experiment results show that four typical classification models have prominent improvement on classification accuracy by incorporating user's avatar information, and the best predictor can derive the accuracy at 88.74%.</p><p>We believe the presented study would bring a novel perspective on online SNS group profiling and community detection. Furthermore, this study also reveals the fact that fusing multi-modal and heterogeneous would establish more accurate user behaviour analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>Few studies have focused on avatars based user profiling. The area of user profiling research has suggested that properties like name, location <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bergsma et al. 2013)</ref>, gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Filho et al. 2016)</ref>, tweets, followers and followees <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tominaga and Hijikata 2015)</ref> are relevant to the creation of user profiles. Previous studies have demonstrated that the relevance of introductory information proved statistically significant. Meanwhile, many natural language processing (NLP) technologies have been applied in the treatment of a user's previous textual tweets for profiling studies. Yet, they may prove less accurate in the case of new users <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bergsma et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tominaga and Hijikata 2015)</ref>. Increased data sources that include avatar selections would be valuable for investigation.</p><p>In the profile images domain, experiments based on profile images (not only avatars) that have queried self-affirmation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Toma 2010)</ref>, adult attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Shu et al. 2017</ref>) and self-presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Zhao and Jiang 2011)</ref> on Facebook have been conducted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhao and Jiang (Zhao and Jiang 2011)</ref> compared Renren (a Chinese SNS) and Facebook to show that people with different cultural backgrounds might select different types of avatars. Tominaga and Hijikata <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tominaga and Hijikata 2015)</ref> collected the data from 300 users of Microblog service to use in experiments with 2 indicators: the ratio of the number of followers to the number of followees as well as the average number of tweets a day. They further developed their work with additional indicators and attempted to predict a user's avatar image from these activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tominaga and Hijikata 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The identification of a user group or the proposal of a user partition scheme based on a certain area is one of the foundations for user analysis. Much of the research to date has focused on estimations of a given user's age, profession, social class <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Sloan et al. 2015)</ref> and gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cheung and She 2017)</ref>, on the optimisation of mobile network traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhang et al. 2016)</ref>, and the identification of opinion leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jing and Lizhen 2014)</ref>. Previous studies also have examined images shared by users <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cheung and She 2017)</ref>, usage activities on mobile devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Zhao et al. 2017</ref>) and introductory data <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sun et al. 2016)</ref>. However, investigations that take into consideration avatars as a means by which to identify and group users merit greater attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Materials and methods</head><p>We performed the following experiments to investigate the user profiling through avatars. First, a semi-automated classification of massive amounts of avatar images was designed to verify that the dataset could be expanded with only limited human interventions. Second, we introduced indicators which could be utilised to enhance user profiling based on user attributes and activities. Additionally, we selected a category from one of the dataset to identify similar users as a case study to verify the results obtained from the two experiments. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the overall structure of this paper. The avatars are firstly categorised with the methods and their relationship as well as application with user behaviour are investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The classification of massive amounts of avatar images</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Avatar classification</head><p>An examination of avatar selection could potentially provide greater information about the user. Avatar classification could include analysis of the medium selected (e.g. a comic or photo), the type of object (e.g. human, animal or inanimate object), quantity (single or multiple), and the meaning of the expression (e.g. logo represents a Company). It is difficult to extract these 'social meanings' using unsupervised learning on large amounts of avatars. For example, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a clustering result generated by unsupervised learning with k-means algorithm. Although we cannot see the detail of each avatar in this figure, it is evident that the avatars are clustered by colour and texture. In this work, deep learning models are developed to automatically categorise the avatars. ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(He et al. 2016)</ref> and AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012)</ref> are used as they provide accuracy and robustness and permit the multi-tasking demanded for this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">User partition scheme</head><p>A user partition scheme developed from the work of Tominaga and Hijikata <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tominaga and Hijikata 2015)</ref>, Lim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lim, Liapis, and Fox Harrell 2016)</ref> and Shu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Shu et al. 2017</ref>) was adopted. Specifically, we separated all avatars into two main categoriesphotographs taken by camera and artificial digital pictures, such as drawings by hand, posters, and cartoons. Avatar images were then categorised according to whether or not they were photographs, by content (human, animal or inanimate objects, etc.), and their form of expression (animation, logo or simple drawing. Additionally, cartoon types were further analysed. A total of 13 categories were established in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Some limitations of the computer technology were considered in the design of these categories. For example, a class described as 'one person' consisted of avatars with one person in it, regardless of whether the person in the avatar is the user himself/herself or not because it would have greatly increased the difficulty and complexity of the classification model to have done otherwise. Three researchers collectively decided on the classification for each image of the training set. To avoid the possibility that one avatar could be placed in more than one category, an order of classification was established which a decision tree used assured that any given image could not be placed in more than one category (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Analysis of user behaviour and personal characteristics</head><p>The classification of images served to obtain a dataset comprised users' avatar selection. An analysis was conducted of the users' public information for the 13 categories and their behaviours. For the purposes of this paper, we selected eight indicators from five aspects for discussion.</p><p>• The FF score and Number of fans: The FF score is the ratio of the number of fans (also called followers) to the number of accounts the user followed. FF scores are often used to evaluate influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Li et al. 2016b</ref>) and to detect spam <ref type="bibr">(Xu, Sun,</ref> and Javaid 2016) due to the ease with which they may be acquired and simplicity with which they may be computed. The single parameter of the number of fans was also used. A higher FF score would indicate that this user has a relatively strong influence and discourse strength.</p><p>• The number of tweets: The number of a user's tweets could help to understand how an account contributes to a social platform. It is obvious that a user who wants to maintain influence on an SNS must maintain a certain frequency of activities.</p><p>• The average number of retweets, likes and comments of one user: In spam detection, a common way to measure whether or not a user is real is to see if the tweets they send receive enough interaction with other users <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Xu, Sun, and Javaid 2016)</ref>. Therefore, the three common forms of microbloggingretweet, like and commentare valid indicators. Previous studies have indicated that the retweet has a potential relationship to the number of fans, the number of followers and the    overall amount of tweets. The 'Like' button is considered to be a measure of user engagement because other users may participate in an evaluation of the post <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gerlitz and Helmond 2013)</ref>. We adopted these factors as a means to identify user interactions. User categories related to ACG generally had higher values (especially the upper quartile) with regard to these indicators of interactions, suggesting a user's reliance and active presence on social networks.</p><p>• The gender distribution: This study sought to identify commonalities among users according to their sociodemographic characteristics. Distinctions based on gender could help to better understand users' behaviours. Unlike the other indicators mentioned above, introductory information provided by users could be false. In terms of gender on an SNS, the selection may be influenced by users' physiological sex, gender identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Egan and Perry 2001)</ref>, privacy awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yao 2011)</ref> or even an error. Filho et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Filho et al. 2016</ref>) and Bamman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bamman, Eisenstein, and Schnoebelen 2014)</ref> proposed models to estimate the real gender of a user based on previous tweets. However, this study was primarily concerned with the partition scheme of users, so choices based on both sex and gender were acceptable for inclusion; the assumption was made that for a large-scale study such as this, any differences were acceptable for inclusion in the calculations.</p><p>• The age: Weibo offers four ways for users to show their age: complete birth date, date without the birth year, birth year without the exact date, or hidden. The user may choose how they would like to display their age. Their choices possible reflect cultural norms and privacy concerns. The rate that users chose to show their complete birth date was measured as was the gender distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiment and results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Dataset</head><p>A crawler system was used on Weibo in May 2017 to collect users' public introductory information, including nicknames, gender, birthdays, personal descriptions, their number of followers, tweets and avatar selection. Additionally, attempts were made to collect each user's previous tweets as well as the number of their retweets, likes and comments. A total of 103,112 user accounts with avatar images from 322,457 users were randomly selected for inclusion in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Semi-automated avatar classification</head><p>A bootstrapping method was used on the training set:</p><p>(1) Initialise N 0 labelled avatar images;</p><p>(2) For each iteration, AlexNet and ResNet classifiers based on a current set of labelled data were used to predict another N i avatar image. The accuracy of the classifier was recorded and incorrect prediction results were corrected manually;</p><p>(3) Repeat (2) until a desired number of runs with accuracy was obtained.</p><p>In this study, a total of 4,708 avatars were collected, 4,672 were labelled, and 36 that proved unidentifiable or unrecognisable were removed from the training set (i.e. coverage = 99.23%, m = 4,672). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the N i and accuracy of each iteration (N i does not include unidentifiable avatars). A dataset of 107,011 users' avatars and classifiers were obtained, with 81.03% accuracy. These results indicated that it is feasible to quickly categorise users -less than 20% of the categorisations needed to be corrected. A total of 107,011 users were chosen for further investigation by relating their activities and attributes with their avatar selections. User Behaviour and Attribute analysis. The 107,011 user accounts were divided into 13 categories and analysed according to the indicators listed in Table1 above. The results of that analysis appear in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.  The results for each category were further analysed. First, the correlations among the different factors were calculated. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> illustrates the Pearson Correlation among three factors (FF score, gender and age).</p><p>The Logo users showed the highest median value of the FF score (8.46, Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>(a)). By tracking these Logo users in our dataset, we discovered that most of them were nonindividual accounts <ref type="bibr">(e.g. government, organisation, company, etc.)</ref>. The nonphotorealistic user reflected the second highest median value of FF score (0.72). Although that was a broad category, often with a combination of features, they yielded some interesting results. For example, some users developed their own cartoon images (usually representing themselves). Some users even use BiaoQingBao (refers to a kind of low-pixel image similar to emojis for chatting to express emotions) as their avatars. A few people who became famous because of Weibo are among them. They have influence on Chinese SNS and are named 'DuanZiShou' (refers to a term used to refer to people who generate and share interesting scripts and jokes in Chinese) and 'WangHong' (refers to celebrities only on social networks). Previous studies have suggested that these accounts tended to be popular for having successfully developed user-generated content (UGC) that spreads like viruses. Gamson separated these celebrities into three types: anti-celebrity, selfmade celebrity and microcelebrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gamson 2011)</ref>. All three types of celebrities were famous for content on the Internet which was easily transformed into intellectual property. These types of activities with earning potential could influence others interested in using social media to make money. A boxplot of the number of fans is provided for comparison (Figure <ref type="figure">4b</ref>). Not only do those users enjoy a high FF score, but also a large number of fans among Logo and non-realistic photograph users.</p><p>The Logo users (median: 664.5) tweeted frequently to maintain their influence on SNS (Figure <ref type="figure">4c</ref>). The study also revealed that the users with object avatars maintained a high median of tweets (245.0) that fell in the upper quartile (3206.75). By tracking accounts from the dataset, users engaged in sales activities were identified on China's social platform (SSM, in Chinese). The SSM fully depended on an SNS platform like WeChat and Weibo to exhibit, promote and sell goods. An SSM account could be run entirely by only one person through the social network. They communicated with customers and delivered goods through express service. This form of self-employment has attracted many people who have free time but do not have much capital and experience in running a full-time company (e.g. new urban migrants <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang and Zhao 2015)</ref>). During the course of the study, it became clear that many avatars in Ob type chose their sales items (e.g. handbags, clothes, cosmetics, etc.) and enacted business by advertising within their own social circle (to their followers). However, the existing platform produced problems: the sale of fake and/or cheaply made products, the infringement on the privacy of users and an interference with users' online experiences. Due to the absence of laws that protect consumers, many SSMs disappeared after having received payment. Interpersonal resources also were depleted when friends are used for profit. Making money from friends could be considered to be immoral -the situation would only be exacerbated if there were any problems with the quality of the products. Additionally, this type of business also spawned several grey commercial areas (e.g. the purchase of zombie fans to exaggerate the scale of business). Weibo has taken many actions to eliminate abuses of the platform. For example, there were SSM accounts that published a massive amount of tweets every day, but the number of real fans was very low (the number of fans would be corrected by Weibo).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4g</ref> shows gender distribution. For this indicator, Logo users were not included due to the fact that they often proved to be non-individual users. The Sc category (0.6559) showed that more than 60% of its users were male, whereas Portrait (0.6256), Flower (0.6257) and Otaku (0.7192) revealed that more than 60% of its users were female. These findings far exceeded expectations, as it challenged the findings from a survey conducted by Japanese scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Keliyan 2011)</ref>. Their survey identified more male than female users. It could be that, although China is geographically close to Japan, a Japanese man who chooses an anime woman character could suffer more criticism about lust and lolicon while women would be more confident and gain more approval if they were to choose such avatars <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Galbraith 2011</ref>). The study found that middle-aged men proved more likely to choose landscapes (scenery) and middle-aged women more likely to choose flowers as their avatar.</p><p>A total of 45.21% of users chose to present their complete birth date, which is utilised for analysis. The Flower (Mid: 34, Qart: 26), Scenery (Mid: 33, Qart: 26) and Object classifications (Mid: 32, Qart: 25) appeared in the top third for medians (Figure <ref type="figure">4h</ref>). The Logo user did not display statistical significance for this indicator. For middle-aged people to prefer scenery and flower images was confirmed using a chi-square test as an example. The preference of selecting flowers or scenery as avatars, assuming H 0 proved irrelevant to age. The statistical results of the relationship between age and avatar selection are exhibited in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. Based on the formula in Eq. 1, the chi-square value equals 317:516ðn ¼ 1Þ, which is larger than the corresponding k value (10.828) when Pðχ 2 � kÞ ¼ 0:001. Therefore, it seems that the hypothesis with regard to H 0 would not be sustained with the confidence larger than 99.9%. We proposed an alternative hypothesis H 1 : the preference for selecting flowers or scenery as avatars are related to a user's age.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">χ 2 ¼ P n i¼1 ðf i À np i Þ 2 np i (1)</formula><p>This result suggested that it would be best to conduct a correlation analysis Pearson correlations were calculated for the avatar selection with FF score, age and gender (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). The value of each avatar category was set to 1 if the user's avatar belonged to the category and 0 if otherwise. Gender preferences appeared clearly -there were more female users in the Pt, Fl and Ot and more males in the Sc and Wc categories. It was interesting that a large number of organisation accounts indicated the gender as 'male'. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">The identification of specific groups: an application scenario</head><p>The identification of avatar features together with user behaviours provided an opportunity to more accurately profile users. For example, it could help social network sites to identify illegal user groups, advertise more effectively, and/or calculate user influence. As mentioned earlier, the features of SSMs were more readily evident when avatars were examined. Therefore, it would be feasible to automatically identify accounts as SSM users with a computation model. Classification into groups could be attained with a machine learning method that utilised specific inputs to determine the placement of different accounts. In this study, we combined the attributes mentioned above with an analysis of avatar content and used them as inputs for a machine learning model. The output of the model was a prediction of whether or not it was an SSM user. To begin with the experiment, we labelled 512 SSM accounts based on the content of previous tweets and randomly selected 512 non-SSM accounts including avatar selection, FF score, number of tweets, gender, age, and topic words calculated by LDA on previous tweets. Avatar selection was one-hot vectorised while topic words were vectorised with a word2vec method. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref>-12 provides an example of SSM accounts and part of their tweets in the dataset that was manually labelled Logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chang and Lin 2011)</ref>, random forest (RF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Breiman 2001</ref>) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Friedman 2002)</ref> were chosen to inform the classification model. Characteristics of avatars were removed from the control set to permit comparison. The model yielded an accuracy of the classification results using a 10-fold cross-validation (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). The most accurate results were achieved using the GBDT model with the accuracy at 88.74%. Additionally, the introduction of avatar type has improved the accuracy of this model by 31.6%. The results indicated that the presented method is suitable for detecting specific type of user in industrial applications due to its high accuracy as well as robust performance.        </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have made an initial attempt to identify special type of SNS users by incorporating users avatar information, which proposes a multi-modal user profiling method that examines the relationship between users' avatar images and their internet behaviours. Specifically, three main conclusions have been derived: First, the proposed bootstrapping-like avatar labelling method can significantly reduce the workload of construction of avatar dataset with labels, thus provides an opportunity for analyses on massive online user avatars and behaviours. Second, specific user behaviour including FF score, gender and ages are significantly correlated to users' avatar types, which provides a behavioural specificity for user group and community identification. Third, the proposed case study on identifying SSM users on Weibo showed the feasibility of our proposed approach, which brings a new perspective on online SNS group profiling and community detection. Additionally, this study also reveals the fact that fusing multi-modal and heterogeneous would establish more accurate user behaviour analyses. However, the presented study is an initial investigation, which still has limitations and large room for further exploration in the future. First, an avatar partition scheme with more detail and additional dimensions (e.g. text-based information <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Huang et al. 2012)</ref>) could be introduced to make the dataset suitable for multiple usages. Second, authorship attribution across different platforms could take into consideration the work on avatars, thereby establishing a more comprehensive user modelling and profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rocha et al. 2017)</ref>. Third, the proposed method is a supervised approach. However, more powerful unsupervised methods are required for massive and labourfree identification of user groups and communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abualigah and Qasim 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Abualigah, Khader, and Hanandeh 2018a,b)</ref>. Finally, further application scenarios are also need to explore, thereby realising the value of our approach applied in these areas and scenarios, such as user modelling (Martinez-Villaseor, Gonzalez-Mendoza, and Hernandez-Gress 2012), behaviour prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Shan et al. 2020)</ref>, recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zhu et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lin et al. 2018)</ref>, etc., with different language environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bahaddad et al. 2018</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
