<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Due to the complexity of analysis and design of the control system for large scale systems and physical inability for exchange of information among subsystems in the control system implementation, it is more convenient to design for each subsystem a decentralized controller, which depends only on the local variables available for measurement. Decentralized control offers several advantages over the centralized control, for instance, robustness against failures, computational efficiency, and design simplicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Using model reference adaptive control strategy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref> established the stability for interconnected systems with unknown parameters based on the standard M -matrix condition, which implies several disadvantages for their applications. Assuming a structure condition (namely, matching condition which imposes that the interconnections enter each subsystem in the same channel as the local input does), <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[7]</ref> was able to eliminate this M -matrix condition and prove the overall stability for arbitrarily strong interconnections. By adding a high-order polynomial in states in the compensation signal, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[4]</ref> guaranteed stability of each subsystem when high-order interconnections are present. Under some geometric conditions and utilizing a design technique based on integrator back stepping, <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> considered interconnected systems with high-order interconnections not satisfying the matching condition. Other works for systems with uncertain parameters were given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[8]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> and the references of the above cited works. All these works except <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> deal with linear systems with possible nonlinear time-varying interconnections. Research on decentralized control for robot manipulators and automated highway systems was carried out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21]</ref>, respectively. Designed for the special structure of the system to be controlled, these control schemes allow no high-order interconnections in states.</p><p>Motivated by research on robot control based on passivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, this paper addresses the problem of designing a decentralized control for mechanical systems described by Euler-Lagrange equations, in which high-order interconnections are involved. High-order interconnections may be present in a large-scale system due to physical interactions between subsystems (cooperative robots, large power plants) or control objectives (air traffic control, automated highway system). It is known that if not considered in the controller design, these high-order interconnections can drive the closed-loop system to instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[16]</ref>. By exploring some physical properties, the proposed controller is designed following the Lyapunov design methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[3]</ref> to cope with the nonlinearities so that nonlinearity cancelation as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> is avoided. Canceling nonlinearities is known not robust against parameter uncertainty and disturbances and even may give rise to an unstable closed-loop in the presence of control input saturation.</p><p>Some preliminary results in this paper were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>. The notations used in this paper are fairly standard. Let x be a vector in n and Ai matrices in n2n . kxk is the Euclidean norm, and kA i k is the induced Euclidean norm, m (A i ) and M (A i ) are the minimum and maximum eigenvalue of A i , respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">m (A i ) 1 = min i f m (A i )g; M (A i ) 1 = max i f M (A i )g.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>Consider the mechanical system described by M i (q i ) q i + C i (q i ; _ q i ) _ q i + g i (q i ) = i</p><p>where qi(t) 2 n are the generalized coordinates of the subsystem i 2 [1; N]; N 2 + ; M i (q i ) denotes the n i 2 n i inertia matrix, C i (q i ; _ q i ) _ q i are Coriolis and centrifugal terms, g i (q i ) the potential energy term, and i the generalized forces applied to the subsystem. These equations can be obtained through modeling a mechanical system by Euler-Lagrange equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we consider the generalized forces i to be of the form i = u i 0 Z i (q; _ q) 0 D i (q i ; _ q i ), with u i the n i -dimensional vector of control inputs, Z i (q; _ q) the interconnections, q T = [q T 1 q T 2 111 q T N ] 2</p><p>n ; n = N i=1 ni, and Di(qi; _ qi) disturbances. Notice that while the disturbances D i (q i ; _ q i ) depend only on the local states, the interconnections Zi(q; _ q) may depend on the states of all subsystems. The dynamical equations of the mechanical system considered in this paper are therefore given by M i (q i ) q i + C i (q i ; _ q i ) _ q i + g i (q i ) + Z i (q; _ q) + D i (q i ; _ q i ) = u i ; i = 1; 2; 1 11;N:</p><p>(2)</p><p>For our purposes, we assume (2) to have the following properties.</p><p>1) Symmetry and boundedness of M i (q i ): for some m i m i &gt; 0; miI Mi(qi) = M T i (qi) miI; 8 qi 2 n . 3) Linear parametrization of the local dynamics of each subsystem:</p><p>M i (q i ) q i + C i (q i ; _ q i ) _ q i + g i (q i ) = Y i (q i ; _ q i ; q i ) i</p><p>where i is an n -dimensional vector containing the parameters of interest, and Y i (q i ; _ q i ; q i ) is an n i 2 n matrix called 0018-9286/00$10.00 © 2000 IEEE regressor, which contains known functions and is uniformly continuous in its arguments.</p><p>4) Boundedness of the interconnections: for c ij 0 and p 1 kZi(q</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">; _ q)k N j=1 cij Qj<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Q j = 1 + kq j k + k _ q j k + 111 + kq j k p + k _ q j k p :</p><p>(5) 5) Boundedness of the disturbances: for di 0 and Qi defined above</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">kD i (q i ; _ q i )k d i Q i :<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Remark 2.1: Assumptions 1 and 2 are essential for establishing the overall stability.

Also, the only knowledge about the interconnections and the local disturbances is that they are bounded by a polynomial in states of up to order p.</p><p>Remark 2.3: The bound on the interconnections ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) is essentially the same as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[16]</ref> because only the "strongest" interconnection bound among all subsystems (see ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) below) will be estimated in the controller implementation.</p><p>Let q d i (t) 2 n be a given smooth (q d i ; _ q d i ; q d i bounded) desired trajectory and define the tracking error as qi (t) 1   = q i (t) 0 q d i (t).

This manipulator is actually lightweight in construction, containing some flexibility in the links. The gear ratios are 1 : 220 for the link one (lower link) and 1 : 184 for the link two (upper link). The nominal manipulator parameters are m 1 = 0:30; m2 = 0:25; l1 = 0:23; l2 = 0:22; lc1 = 0:12; lc2 = 0:11; I 1 = 0:0013; I 2 = 0:0011.</p><p>The control law was implemented in a PC 486 at 33 MHz, equipped with a dSpace real-time control card. The analog output of this card is 610 volts. In the experiments, only the link positions were measured using two optical encoders mounted on the motor shaft with resolution 0.0048 rad./pulse for link 1 and 0.0057 rad./pulse for link 2. To avoid excessive noise caused by numerical approximation, the link velocities were estimated with a first-order filter.

The parameter was fixed to 2. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref> shows the desired and actual trajectories for both links, the corresponding control inputs are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6</ref>.

CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposes a robust decentralized control for systems modeled by Euler-Lagrange equations which involve high-order interconnections. This class of nonlinear systems covers a wide range of applications of mechanical systems where the interconnections exist because of either physical interactions or control objectives.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Finite Settling Time Control of the Double Integrator Using a Virtual Trap-Door Absorber</head><p>Robert T. Bupp, Dennis S. Bernstein, Vijaya S. Chellaboina, and Wassim M. Haddad</p><p>Abstract-Finite settling time control of the double integrator is considered. The approach taken is to design a compensator based on a virtual lossless absorber which is tuned so that, at some predetermined time, the virtual subsystem possesses all of the system's energy. At this time the controller is turned off, and the double integrator remains at rest at the origin. This strategy gives the appearance of instantaneously removing all of the system's energy as if a trap door had been sprung. A practically useful feature of the virtual trap-door absorber is that only position measurement is required. Parameters for the virtual trap-door absorber controller are chosen, and the resulting controller is compared to the classical minimal-time and minimal-energy controllers, which require measurements of both position and velocity. Index Terms-Double integrator, finite settling time control, minimal-time and minimal-energy optimal control, virtual absorber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Exponential stabilization of rigid-body translational or rotational motion, M q = u, the double integrator problem, is obtained by setting u = 0a _ q 0 bq, where a; b &gt; 0. However, it is often desirable to stabilize the motion in finite time. Several approaches have been considered for this problem [1]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[6]</ref> including the classical minimal-time and minimal-energy controllers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[8]</ref>. The purpose of this paper is to develop a continuous-time feedback controller that achieves finite settling time for the double integrator using position measurement only. Position feedback may be practical when position information is obtained from sensors such as LVDT's, capacitive sensors, and encoders. V. S. Chellaboina and W. M. Haddad are with the School of Aerospace Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0150 USA (e-mail: vc19@cad.gatech.edu; wm.haddad@aerospace.gatech.edu).</p><p>Publisher Item Identifier S 0018-9286(00)04096-4.</p><p>The controller we develop in this paper is based upon physical principles rather than optimality criteria. Inspired by mechanical absorbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref>, this controller emulates the action of a proof-mass absorber by applying forces that a physical absorber would apply. Since the proof-mass absorber is emulated and is not a physical device, our controller can be viewed as a virtual absorber <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref>. A general treatment of controllers that exploit energy transfer between real and virtual subsystems is given in <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>.</p><p>The controller design involves choosing the values of the virtual proof mass and stiffness so that, at a predetermined time, the energy of the double integrator is completely transferred to the absorber subsystem. Ordinarily, the absorber subsystem would possess all of the energy only instantaneously, after which time energy would return to the plant. However, since the time at which total energy transfer occurs is known independent of the initial state of the plant, we turn off the controller at that instant, so that all of the energy is instantaneously removed from the plant, as if it had exited through a trap door, and thus the mass subsequently remains at rest at the origin.</p><p>A virtual controller using acceleration measurements and similar to the trap door absorber is given in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. The use of resetting as in the present paper and <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> in order to instantaneously remove controller energy is not discussed in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</p></div>

Our goal is to use feedback control to bring the position q 1 (t) and velocity _ q 1 (t) to zero in finite time using only a measurement of the position q1(t). The feedback controller we consider emulates the lossless system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where the springs K and k as well as the mass m are virtual elements whose effect on the mass M is implemented by means of a dynamic compensator and a force actuator.
