<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distributed Control Design for Systems Interconnected Over an Arbitrary Graph</head><p>Cédric Langbort, Ramu Sharat Chandra, and Raffaello D'Andrea, Senior Member, IEEE Abstract-We consider the problem of synthesizing a distributed dynamic output feedback controller achieving performance for a system composed of different interconnected sub-units, when the topology of the underlying graph is arbitrary. First, using tools inspired by dissipativity theory, we derive sufficient conditions in the form of finite-dimensional linear matrix inequalities when the interconnections are assumed to be ideal. These inequalities are coupled in a way that reflects the spatial structure of the problem and can be exploited to design distributed synthesis algorithms. We then investigate the case of lossy interconnection links and derive similar results for systems whose interconnection relations can be captured by a class of integral quadratic constraints that includes constant delays.</p><p>Index Terms-Dissipativity, distributed control, large-scale systems, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>O VER THE PAST few years, there has been a renewal of interest in systems consisting in the interaction/cooperation of a large number of spatially interconnected units. Examples include unmanned aerial vehicles or satellites flying in formation to achieve a particular task <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, automated highways <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, cross-directional control in the pulp/paper and chemical industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, as well as problems posed by emerging fields such as control of communication networks or smart structures (large arrays of micromechanical and electrical actuators and sensors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. When controlling such systems, the classical approach that consists in lumping all subsystems together and controlling them as a single large-scale system is not always appropriate. For example, in the case of the automated highway or formation flight, it seems more reasonable to regulate the system by equipping each vehicle with its own controller (maybe sharing information with the neighboring ones) than to rely on a centralized control authority that observes and acts on all units at once. In general, there are two main reasons why one might want to avoid centralized controllers.</p><p>• First, using a centralized control scheme typically requires modifying the original interconnection topology of the system. This may be undesirable for applications such as communication networks, where introducing new channels from and to a remote subsystem can sometimes be less practical and more expensive than increasing transmission rates over the pre-existing ones. It would thus be more profitable to be able to respect the structure of the plant's physical interconnection for control design. • Even for systems that are not physical networks but whose interconnection structure follows from mere coupling between the equations describing the different units, centralized control has a major drawback. By its very nature, a centralized controller is bound to have a large number of states, inputs and outputs, which is precisely the situation classical optimal control design algorithms cannot handle. Hence, for this reason also, one would like to use a control architecture that takes advantage of the problem's structure and helps reduce or distribute the computational effort of the design process. In the recent literature, it has often been taken for granted that the natural way to address these two points is to adopt a fully decentralized architecture, where a controller is assigned to each plant's subsystem, providing it with corrective action based solely on local measurements. Successful synthesis methods have even been proposed that give convex conditions for the existence of a decentralized controller guaranteeing well-posedness, stability and performance of the closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. However, these results are only valid when the interconnection structure has some special property (identical subsystems with nearest neighbors coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, hierarchical or nested coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> or quadratic invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>) and/or yield static state feedback controllers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>The goal of the present paper is to show that both these limitations can be bypassed if one agrees to look for distributed rather than decentralized controllers. More precisely, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of a controller with the same structure as the plant, when the latter is made of possibly different linear time-invariant (LTI) subsystems connected over an arbitrary graph. Our results take the form of a set of coupled linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the particular structure of which lends itself to distributed computation over the system's interconnection graph. With such an implementation, distributed control also appears to be a good alternative to centralized control, as the interconnection topology is respected and the design algorithm is scalable.</p><p>The approach taken here builds on recent papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, where the idea of distributed control was first introduced. We extend the results to arbitrary interconnections and in so doing, clarify the link between these works and those applying dissipativity theory to large-scale systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. This paper is closest in spirit to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, in that we treat the interconnection as a set of constraints on the coupling signals and use the corresponding multipliers (the supply rates of dissipativity theory) as extra design variables. However, looking for distributed rather than decentralized controllers (i.e., allowing the controller to use structure information) enables us to formulate convex conditions for the existence of output-feedback controllers, in the exact same way as allowing for online parameter measurements in linear parameter-varying (LPV) synthesis yields a convex relaxation of the robust control design problem.</p><p>The point of view outlined above is also related to integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) analysis methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, because our dissipativity conditions can be seen as a conservative full-block -procedure when parameterizing the interconnection subset by a family of IQCs. Exploring this connection will allow us to treat systems with more general imperfect communication links.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce a first class of interconnected systems, along with a general framework for describing them. Analysis conditions for these so-called ideal systems are derived in Section III and used in Section IV for controller design. In Section V, we present numerical experiments in order to compare the performance achieved by our distributed controller with that obtained with a centralized one. In Section VI, we consider another type of systems, this time with nonideal interconnections, that can be described via IQCs. Analysis and synthesis results of the previous sections are extended to this class. We also quantify the gap between systems with ideal and directed interconnections.</p><p>Notation: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS</head><p>In this paper, we will concern ourselves with systems consisting of an assembly of , possibly different LTI subsystems connected arbitrarily, as depicted for example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In general, such interconnected systems can be described by an undirected graph, the state-space representation of the different subsystems and an interconnection condition, as we will now explain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Underlying Graph Structure</head><p>We will use graph-theoretic terminology only for notational convenience. The graph of a interconnected system is defined as follows. First, we identify the set of vertices with the set , where each is an LTI finite-dimensional subsystem. Then, we let the set of nonoriented edges be defined as . Note that we can have edges of the form , corresponding to cases where a subsystem feeds back into itself.</p><p>To every edge , we associate its size, an integer . It will prove convenient to use the notation even when (recall that edge is only defined for ). We do so by letting when . By allowing , we also capture the case where subsystem and are not interconnected.</p><p>For our purposes, all the relevant information regarding the topology of the interconnection can be summarized by a symmetric by matrix , with entries , the so-called (weighted) adjacency matrix of graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We will denote by the vector space of partitioned vectors , where each can itself be further partitioned as , each being of size . When , each is of size for all . Likewise, we define for partitioned signals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Interconnection Signals and Subsystems</head><p>Each subsystem is captured by the following state-space equations: for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where , , , , and for all . In (2), is a disturbance acting on subsystem , is a performance output and and are the overall interconnection signals used by . A comment on notation is in order. Our nomenclature for the various matrices follows that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which was itself inspired by multidimensional systems theory. In this framework, subscript "T" refers to temporal variables (the states) while subscript "S" refers to spatial variables (the interconnection signals).</p><p>For each given , we partition signals and further into and -the interconnection signals shares with . By adding zero-components to the signals of smaller size and modifying the state-space matrices of (2) if this is not the case, we can always assume that , , and all belong to for all . This, in turn, naturally defines two signals and such that , for all . Note that and designate a and -valued signal respectively, while is a component of the vector . This construction allows us to think of as a square, by , matrix without loss of generality and will simplify the notations and proofs of Section III and IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Interconnection Relation</head><p>Once the relationships between and have been specified at each vertex, we can get a description of the interconnected system with input and output by closing all loops. The simplest way this can be done is by requiring that for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> or, equivalently, that for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where the interconnection subspace is defined as for all (5) An interconnection defined by (4) will be called ideal since in that case, every edge specifies an exact mathematical equality between two signals. Later in this paper, we will consider more general interconnected systems whose edges are, in some sense, "lossy," and whose interconnection relations can be described via IQCs. Our goal, for now, is to derive analysis and synthesis conditions for systems with ideal interconnections, using the underlying structure of the graph and the state-space representations of its subsystems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ANALYSIS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Well-Posedness, Stability, and Contractiveness</head><p>The construction of an interconnected system given in Section II is not always well defined because the signals satisfying the interconnection may not exist or be unique. Thus, we need the following.</p><p>Definition 1: An interconnected system defined by adjacency matrix and state-space matrices as per ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is well-posed if the two subspaces and satisfy where for all (6) and When an interconnected system is well-posed, initial conditions and disturbances uniquely determine the signals , , , and . More precisely, if all disturbances belong to , then (2)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) have a unique solution in . We will say that a well-posed interconnected system is stable if, in the absence of disturbances ( for all ) and for any set of initial conditions, is a smooth function of time and goes to zero as approaches infinity, for all . Finally, it is easy to see that if an interconnected system is well-posed and stable then and belong to for all when all do. Such a system thus defines an input/output map (i.e. a linear operator) from to and its induced norm characterizes its performance. We will say that it is contractive if there exists such that</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Sufficient Conditions for Well-Posedness, Stability, and Contractiveness</head><p>For each , we introduce the quadratic form on <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where, for all , the symmetric by matrices satisfy ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)</p><p>Using ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), it is easy to show the following. Proposition 1: Let the quadratic form be defined on by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> then vanishes on the interconnection subspace .</p><p>Following the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, we will say that the interconnection is neutral with respect to the supply rates , . It will prove useful to partition each symmetric scale into four by blocks as for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Using ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and symmetry of , we then get that and, thus, the set for all is entirely parameterized by the two sets and skew-symmetric</p><p>We are now in a position to state our first analysis conditions.</p><p>Theorem 1: An interconnected system is well-posed, stable and contractive if there exist symmetric matrices and for all , and matrices for all , with skew-symmetric, such that and LMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> is satisfied for all , with <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Proof: We start with well-posedness. From ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>), we see that, in particular By definition of the 's and property <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, this means that each is positive definite on . In turn, is also positive definite on while according to Proposition 1, vanishes on . Thus, . Once we have established well-posedness, the state and interconnection signals and of each subsystem are welldefined for all and initial conditions , and belongs to for all . Moreover, when is chosen to be identically zero for all , these signals are smooth functions of time and for all . Pre-and postmultiplying (11) by the nonzero vector and its transpose and summing over , we get that for all . Hence, using again the fact that vanishes on , we see that is a Lyapunov function since ; this establishes stability of the system. Finally, when a disturbance is applied in the form of a signal for each , , , , and are all signals, since the interconnected system is stable. Also, belongs to for almost all . Pre-and postmultiplying <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> by and its transpose, summing over and using the strict inequality in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, we see that there exists such that for almost all . Then, using the fact that vanishes on the interconnection subspace and integrating from 0 to , we get Now, use the fact that the system is stable to conclude that the right-hand side of the latter inequality is zero when for all and, in turn, that the system is contractive.</p><p>Apart from the well-posedness statement, Theorem 1 can be seen as a dissipativity result <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>: It just states that the interconnected system is strictly dissipative with respect to supply rate , with storage function , whenever each subsystem is strictly dissipative with respect to supply rate , with storage function . Hence, it is simply a particular case of results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> regarding neutral interconnections of dissipative systems. From this standpoint, Theorem 1 is even more conservative than these results because we have restricted ourselves to a particular type of quadratic supply rates, as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. However, the fact that we consider these supply rates as free parameters (apart from the constraint (8)) gives less conservative analysis conditions than the classical methods requiring each subsystem to have small-gain or be passive <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The latter conditions would yield decoupled LMIs via theKalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, while LMIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> are coupled through the scales .</p><p>As we will see, constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> plays an important role for synthesis. Imposing that the interconnection be neutral in this explicit way is indeed essential for obtaining a convex characterization of interconnected controllers, when we apply Theorem 1 to a closed-loop system in Section IV.</p><p>Before doing so, we would like to end this section by pointing out an interesting feature of analysis conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>: They can guarantee stability of the interconnected system even when the subsystems are unstable. For example, for three subsystems interconnected on a ring, with and the stability LMIs corresponding to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> are feasible with for all</p><p>In fact, after reordering the interconnection signals of the second subsystem, one can rewrite the corresponding interconnected system as a periodic system in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, i.e., as a system made of identical units, identically coupled to each other. One can then use the techniques of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to prove stability irrespective of the number of subsystems.</p><p>As a consequence of this remark, the distributed controllers that we design in Section IV will not ensure the stability of each subsystem in closed-loop, but only that of the entire closedloop system. This should be compared with the results of Sections VI-B and C, where we consider systems with nonideal interconnection relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SYNTHESIS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Formulation</head><p>Let , the plant, be an interconnected system and assume that subsystem now has a control input and a measured output in addition to the signals given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, and that <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> for all and . In the rest of this paper, we will assume that for all . This is without loss of generality since one can use loop-shifting (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the references therein) to construct the appropriate controller when this situation is not at hand. We want to find another interconnected system ( , the controller) with adjacency matrix and subsystems , , given by ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) such that the closed-loop is well-posed, stable and contractive. In addition, we require that whenever . This means that if two subsystems cannot communicate in the plant, this is also the case in closed loop. We are thus aiming for a distributed control strategy, as pictured in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Solution</head><p>Since the plant and controller are defined over the same graph , so is the closed-loop system. The entries of its adjacency matrix are given by for all . It is also routine to establish that each subsystem of the closed-loop system admits the state-space matrices   As illustrated, the size of each of the controller's edges should be zero whenever the corresponding plant's edge has size zero. We will show that the controller's edges' size is at most three times that of the plant's edges.</p><p>for all . The state of each subsystem thus has size . Before applying our analysis results to the closed-loop, we make the convention that every symmetric matrix is partitioned according to the plant's and controller's states as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> with and . Likewise, if belongs to , we partition it according to the plant's and controller's interconnection signals as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> with and . Note that if is symmetric, . Applying Theorem 1 to the closed-loop system then yields the following.</p><p>Proposition 2: The closed-loop system is well-posed, stable, and contractive if there exist symmetric matrices and for all , and matrices for , with skew-symmetric such that and LMI ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) is satisfied for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> where and with (25</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34)</formula><p>Although the derivation of ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) is similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, note that the structure of matrices and are different because the closed-loop system's interconnection signals are the concatenation of those of the plant and the controller.</p><p>It follows from ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) that the obtained conditions would be convex in the scalings and supply rate matrices if the controller's data were known. Thus, we would like to find an equivalent formulation that does not involve the decision variables , . This elimination step requires two preliminary results that are related to the inertia of the synthesis supply rates.</p><p>Recall that the inertia of a symmetric matrix is the triplet , where , and are the number of negative, zero, and positive eigenvalues of . The following lemma is proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 1 (Elimination Lemma): Let be a symmetric matrix with inertia and . The matrix inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> in the unstructured unknown has a solution if and only if</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(36a) (36b)</formula><p>where and are arbitrary matrices whose columns span the null-space of and respectively.</p><p>When (36a) and (36b) are satisfied, a solution of ( <ref type="formula">35</ref>) can be found as follows. First, introduce nonsingular matrices and such that , with and of full-column rank and let where the matrix is partitioned as being of the size of Then, a satisfactory is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> where and , satisfy</p><p>The assumption regarding the inertia of guarantees that such and exist. Also, note that solving this inequality only requires to diagonalize the symmetric matrix in an orthonormal basis and take the columns of to be eigenvectors associated with negative eigenvalues. If thus obtained is singular, there always exists such that is invertible and , satisfy the matrix inequality. In practice, one should use the largest such in order to avoid numerical conditioning problems.</p><p>Proposition 3: For a set of matrices such that the inequalities of Proposition 2 are satisfied, define matrices and as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Then, let be given by for otherwise.</p><p>Then Before proving Theorem 2, a remark is in order regarding conditions (47)-(49). The first idea that may come to mind for solving this set of matrix inequalities is to regroup them as a single LMI and use conventional semidefinite programming (SDP) packages to solve it. Note, however, that, even for moderate values of and , this LMI will typically be of large size. Another option is to realize that (47)-( <ref type="formula">49</ref>) are in fact structured, just like the underlying control problem they are derived from, and try to exploit this structure to reduce computational effort and design distributed algorithms that are directly implementable on the graph . Indeed, the way two different LMIs are coupled through the presence of a common scaling matrix and completely parallels the spatial structure of the plant. We can think of two ways in which to take advantage of this structure.</p><p>-At a high and conceptually simple level, one can exploit the mere convexity of conditions ( <ref type="formula">47</ref>)-(49) to decompose them into smaller problems that can be independently and repeatedly solved at each vertex of the graph, while some variables are transmitted along the edges. For the "method of alternating projections" proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, these variables are simply the coupling scales , , while each subproblem consists in determining the projection of a point onto the feasible set of an LMI. We are currently working on another such decomposition method using subgradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>-On a lower level, one could start with a classical interior-point method for SDP and use the particular structure of the problem only to calculate Newton steps in a distributed fashion. This should result in more efficient algorithms than the higher level ones. This is also ongoing work. Proof: "Only if:" First, we note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>  Because is a permutation, it is an orthogonal matrix and, thus Hence and, according to Proposition 3 if all 's are invertible. If this situation is not at hand, we can perturb the and/or blocks of the singular 's by a small amount to obtain an invertible one and inequality (24) will remain satisfied. Permuting the rows of and the rows and lines of , we can put (44) in the form of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> with similar to and has the same inertia as , namely and we can thus apply Lemma 1 to eliminate the controller's data and obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</p><p>Permuting the lines and columns back gives inequalities involving block-diagonal matrices again, which can in turn be decoupled into matrix inequalities. Note that, because of (46), is given by where (50) for each and One then obtains LMIs (47) and ( <ref type="formula">48</ref> </p><p>(44) and (50) are satisfied for some and as given in Proposition 2. It will then follow that (24) holds.</p><p>We do this by first rewriting LMIs (47) and (48) in the form of (36) for , , , and as in the proof of necessity. At this point, one would want to use the necessity part of Lemma 1 to establish the existence of a controller. This, however, requires some care: even if matrix satisfies the inertia assumption of the lemma, one can only conclude that there exists an unstructured matrix such that the corresponding version of (36a) is satisfied. This is not enough, as we want a solution of the form .</p><p>This leads us to restrict our choice of design scales so that each has the right inertia. In this case, the existence of each can be established by applying Lemma 1 to each LMI separately. Recalling the expression of , we see that it is enough to show that if LMIs (47)-( <ref type="formula">49</ref>) are feasible, the design scales can be chosen such that i) for all ; ii) for all ; iii) for all ; iv) is skew-symmetric for all . It is classical (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) that (49) guarantees that condition i) can be met. We now prove iv) and ii) when . For any fixed , let We can always assume that is invertible, after a small perturbation if necessary. Since and are skew-symmetric by assumption, and . Take (51) then easy algebra shows that Furthermore, , and is symmetric. One can thus partition these matrices as with skew-symmetric and to satisfy conditions iv) and ii), since and is similar to via a permutation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES</head><p>In this section, we present numerical results that illustrate the tradeoff between performance and delocalization, when one uses a distributed controller. The files used can be downloaded from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>We generated four sets of 100 systems. Each of these interconnected systems was made of 15 subsystems with the following properties.</p><p>• The dimensions of , , , , and was one.</p><p>• Subsystem was interconnected to subsystem with probability 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, or 1 (each set corresponds to a different probability of interconnection).

This was done to ensure that each subsystem was controllable and observable, and that the resulting control problem was not singular <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For each system, we designed a distributed, interconnected control system using the algorithms presented in this paper; we uniformly scaled each and until the synthesis LMIs in Section IV were within 1 percent of not being feasible. Then, we synthesized the corresponding distributed controller and calculated the -norm of the closed-loop system. Finally, we designed the optimal, centralized controller using the standard formulas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The results may be found in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. The plots have the following meaning.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>(a), a point (x,y) belongs to the graph if and only if the fraction of problems x for which the ratio of the centralized performance to the distributed performance is greater than or equal to . For example, for a probability of interconnection of 10 percent, the ratio of the centralized norm to the distributed norm is greater than 0.7 in 60% of the cases.

Similarly, the distributed norm can never be better than the best guaranteed upper bound.</p><p>Even though recent results on the gap between the complex structured singular value and its upper bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> make us expect that the upper bound guaranteed by LMIs ( <ref type="formula">47</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">49</ref>) can also be arbitrarily conservative in the worst case, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>(b) suggests that, for a typical, randomly chosen interconnected system, this bound may not be so conservative. For example, for a rather densely interconnected graph with interconnection probability of 50%, the conservatism of the upper bound is less than 20% in more than 85% of the problems. This is essentially saying that the performance degradation plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>(a) really captures the inherent gap between distributed and centralized control, and is not a result of the conservatism of our techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NONIDEAL INTERCONNECTIONS</head><p>So far, we have only been interested in the design of distributed controllers for systems with ideal interconnection relations, as defined in Section II-C. However, in many cases of practical interest, interconnections are not ideal in the sense that information is degraded while passing from one subsystem to the other, so that relation (4) does not hold. For example, when each edge stands for an actual communication channel and signals between subsystem and subsystem can be thought of as being physically transmitted along this channel, one can reasonably expect that and are not rigorously equal but are, at the very least, related by a delay. A notable exception, however, is given by semidiscretized partial differential equations, where blocks represent finite elements and interactions between them correspond to pure mathematical coupling (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for an example of how to put such discretized partial differential equations in the framework of this paper).</p><p>It is then natural to ask whether the results of the previous sections hold for or can be adapted to systems with nonideal interconnections. As one might expect, the answer depends crucially on the type of nonidealities allowed in the description of the system. The following example, in particular, shows that the analysis conditions of Theorem 1 (and, thus, Theorem 2) must be modified when dealing with interconnections subject to delays. Consider the interconnected system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, where the block has the following transfer function between and :</p><p>Taking , , , and as a representation of the subsystem, it is easy to see that the conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> for well-posedness and stability (there are no disturbances or outputs ) are satisfied with , , and . However, the Nyquist plot of clearly demonstrates that the distributed system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> is unstable, when any small delay is introduced in the positive feedback loop between and . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. IQC Model of Directed Interconnection Relations</head><p>Motivated by the preceding discussion and example, we now turn our attention to a new class of interconnected systems with directed interconnections. For these systems, interconnection relations (4) are replaced by more general matrix inequality constraints on signals and . More precisely, the subspace of Section II-C is replaced by for all (54) This type of interconnection subspace, defined as a subset of instead of , forces us to adopt an operator framework and redefine well-posedness, stability and contractiveness (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). We start with a lemma, proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, that characterizes in terms of operators. Lemma 2: Let and be signals in . Then, there exists a contractive operator such that if and only if . This shows that the IQC in (54) can be represented by for all (55) for some choice of contractive operators . In turn, the interconnection relation specified by captures a wide range of nonideal interconnection channels, such as arbitrary delays, arbitrary attenuations, and low-pass filtering; all of which are present to some extent in physical communication channels. The adjective "directed" used for such interconnections stems from the fact that some of these nonidealities are causal with noncausal inverses, which imposes a direction for information transfer between subsystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Now, if we also look at the subsystems (2) of a directed interconnected system in the input-output form for all (56) it is possible to represent its input-output map as the linear fractional transformation (LFT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> pictured in the block diagram of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5(a)</ref>. In this diagram, denotes the bounded LTI operator mapping to where for all , while, according to Lemma 2, is any operator of the form for all (57) Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we can then define stability as the property that all internal signals are bounded when an external signal is injected into the exposed interconnections between the subsystems, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5(b</ref>). More rigorously, we have the following.</p><p>Definition 2: A directed interconnected system consisting of subsystems (56) and interconnection constraint (54) is said to be well-posed and stable if the map has a bounded inverse on , for every choice of as per (57), where <ref type="bibr">(58)</ref> has been partitioned to conform with the vector . Finally, we will say that such a system with directed interconnection is contractive if it is stable and if there exists such that for all , and for all of the form specified in (57).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Analysis of Systems With Directed Interconnections</head><p>The great advantage of representing a directed interconnected system as an LFT is that we can apply standard results in robust control theory to obtain necessary and sufficient LMI conditions for well-posedness, stability, and contractiveness. As was done for systems with ideal interconnections, these conditions can then be used to provide a convex characterization of all controllers that have the same distributed structure as the plant and guarantee that these properties are satisfied in closed-loop.</p><p>Theorem 3: A directed interconnected system is well-posed, stable, and contractive if and only if there exist symmetric matrices and for all such that , and LMI (11) are satisfied for all , with , and . Note the differences between Theorem 3 and Theorem 1: Scales are assumed to be negative definite while is set to zero for all , . Also, the LMI conditions are now both necessary and sufficient.</p><p>Proof: We first prove sufficiency. The goal is to determine the LTI operator such that system is described by the LFT of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> and apply classical results from robust control theory to it. Notice that we can assume to be stable, since from the (1,1) block of the left-hand side of (11), we have where and are positive definite by hypothesis. This implies that i.e. that each individual subsystem is stable and, therefore, so is . Let the structured operators be defined by (59)</p><p>Define the operator as . Similarly, define , and . Note that maps to , maps to , maps to , and maps to . If is the permutation matrix that maps to , then we see that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> is given by (60) Since we have assumed that for all , , it can be verified that is always a symmetric matrix. Now, we can rewrite system as</p><p>where , and is a permutation matrix that reorders the rows and columns of . Thus, the interconnected system can be finally written as the LFT shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>.</p><p>From the scaled small-gain theorem, a sufficient condition for well-posedness, stability, and contractiveness is therefore that there exists in the positive commutant of for all (62) the being defined in (59), such that the following operator inequality holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(63)</formula><p>Using the structure of commutant, we can write where, for all , has the form indicated in the statement of Theorem 3. Using the fact that is a permutation and, hence, an orthogonal matrix, we have where for all (67) Recalling the way was defined, this means that the preceding conditions for robust performance reduce to a system of coupled operator inequalities, namely (68) An application of the KYP lemma now shows that the aforementioned inequality is satisfied if and only if the following LMI is satisfied:</p><p>(69) Rearranging, we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> in the form given in the statement of the theorem. Also, the LMIs and are satisfied because of the way the scales were defined. This proves the sufficiency part of the theorem.</p><p>For necessity, we may invoke standard results <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> which state that the scaled small-gain theorem is both necessary and sufficient for contractiveness when the interconnection operators are allowed to vary in the class of linear operators for all This proves Theorem 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Distributed Controller Synthesis for Directed Interconnections</head><p>We can now proceed as in Section IV and use Theorem 3 and the Elimination Lemma to derive convex conditions for the existence of distributed controllers for plants with directed interconnections. We are again looking for controllers "with the same structure as the plant" but this phrase has now gained a new meaning. The controller's interconnection relation is not only specified by the IQC of (54) but, more precisely, if each of the plant's communication channel is given by for some contractive operator , we are looking for controllers whose interconnection signals satisfy for some integer and the same operator . This condition-which physically means that the plant and controller use identical communication channels-is of the same nature (and plays the same role in rewriting the closed-loop system as an LFT) as the basic assumption in LPV control design, where one is looking for controllers that are parameterized in the same way as the plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>The main synthesis result for systems with directed interconnection is as follows.</p><p>Theorem 4: Let be a directed interconnected system consisting of subsystems (56) and interconnection relation (55). There exists a distributed controller with the same structure as such that for all and the closedloop system is well-posed, stable, and contractive if and only if there exist symmetric matrices , and , for all such that LMIs (47)-( <ref type="formula">49</ref>) hold for all with and, in</p><p>Proof: The proof is essentially identical to that of Theorem 2, starting with the analysis conditions of Theorem 3 applied to the closed-loop system. An important difference, however, is that definiteness of scales , and (70) make the necessity part simpler. Indeed, they guarantee that each satisfies the inertia condition of Lemma 1 without having to take for .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Nonideal Interconnections and the Necessity of Analysis Conditions (11)</head><p>We now have analysis and synthesis tools for systems with ideal and directed interconnections. In the latter case, the conditions are even necessary and sufficient. An interesting question, however, remains.</p><p>We had already remarked in Section III-B that analysis conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> were conservative for ideal interconnections. Yet, as the example at the beginning of this section showed, they are not sufficient to guarantee stability for directed interconnections, as arbitrarily small delays in the communication channels can destabilize an interconnected system satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Thus, there seems to be a gap regarding how the properties of these two types of interconnected systems relate to Theorem 1.</p><p>For the sake of completeness, and because the construction is of independent interest, we shall now quantify this gap, characterizing the type of nonideal interconnections for which conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>  where for all signal , is the symmetric matrix defined by (72) As was the case for directed interconnections, we need a characterization of IQC (71) via a class of linear operators in order to treat the corresponding nonideally interconnected systems as LFTs and define well-posedness, stability and contractiveness for them. The following was proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 3: Given vector-valued signals and with components in a separable Hilbert space, there exists a scalar unitary operator such that if and only if , where is defined in (72). Lemma 3 means that, for each communication channel, there exists a unitary linear operator , such that for all (73) Note that if is set to 1 for all , we recover the ideal interconnection (4). Using Lemma 3 and proceeding as for directed interconnected systems, we can represent a system by the LFT of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5(a)</ref>, where belongs to the set for (74)</p><p>We can define well-posedness, stability, and contractiveness just like in Section VI-A.</p><p>In the remainder of this paper, we assume that each subsystem of a nonideally interconnected system is a stable LTI system and, to simplify notations, that signals and have the same dimension, i.e., , for all . We also let . 2) Necessity Results via an S-Procedure: In this subsection, we use ideas similar to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to prove that the LMI conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> are necessary for the well-posedness, stability, and contractiveness of an interconnected system with subsystems given by (56) and nonideal interconnection (71). In particular, we prove the following.</p><p>Theorem 5: A nonideally interconnected system is well-posed, stable and contractive only if there exist symmetric matrices for all and for all , with skew-symmetric, such that the input-output map of each subsystem satisfies Note that since all are assumed to be stable, the adjoint used in the above theorem does exist and we can apply the KYP lemma to yield LMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. The aforementioned necessity result can also be stated as follows: If the operator inequality (75), and hence LMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> are not satisfied, then there exists an operator , and hence signals satisfying (56) and (71) which renders the LFT of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> ill-posed.</p><p>The proof of this result extends standard S-procedure results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to the case where the operator in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5(a)</ref>. is unitary (instead of the usual contractive-see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>). Another extension is the fact that we allow both an operator and its inverse to appear in the structured operator , as per (74).</p><p>Proof: Consider the system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>(a), with the operator The well-posedness, stability and contractiveness of this system are well-known to be equivalent, via the main loop theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, to the robust well-posedness of the LFT shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, where is an arbitrary contractive If , this means that the map must have a (uniformly) bounded inverse. Suppose that this is the case. Let be the class of all operators . Then there does not exist a nonzero signal such that for any . In order the simplify the proof, we find it convenient to write and introduce the maps , such that and the map , such that , for any which has been appropriately partitioned to conform with the components of . By the IQC characterization of unitary of Lemma (86) Now, it is known that the set of time-invariant (matrix-valued) quadratic forms on is convex <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and by the hypothesis on nonexistence of unit-norm solutions to (81) and (82), does not intersect the (trivially closed and convex) set in given by .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have shown how the tools of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, originally developed for spatially invariant interconnected systems, can be extended to derive sufficient convex synthesis conditions for heterogeneous systems interconnected over arbitrary graphs.</p><p>While dissipativity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> was used to motivate and derive the first set of analysis conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, IQCs theory allowed us to show that the LMIs become nonconservative for a particular (Section VI-D) of the communication channels between subsystems. The problem of synthesis of controllers subject to having the same structure as the plant was cast as a convex semidefinite program with an interesting coupled structure in Theorem 2, the main result of this paper. It was also observed that this may lead to efficient ways of solving the semidefinite programs (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for more details).</p><p>Since the class of IQCs in Section VI-D does not capture delays (even arbitrarily small) that may be present between communicating subsystems, we introduced another choice of IQCs (Section VI-A) to model the communication channels and provide robustness to nonidealities such as delays and attenuations. This had the additional attractive property (at the expense of conservatism) that the number of communication channels between controller subsystems is smaller in general than that required by Theorem 2.</p><p>It is an open question as to whether other, less conservative IQC models of time delays (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) can be used to design less conservative structured controllers. So, it is the development of SDP algorithms that takes full advantage of the structure imposed to LMIs by the distributed nature of the underlying control problem.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof of Proposition 4</head><p>In what follows, the notation for symmetric matrices and with will mean that . Where required, we use the notation established in Section VI for the various signals relevant to the interconnected system in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. The following lemma is, for example, proved in <ref type="bibr">[</ref> , where the are the scalar components of . Consider the subspace of spanned by the , . Let be any orthonormal basis for (if the dimension of is less than , may be augmented with elements not in so that its dimension can be assumed to be without loss of generality). Associate to each the vectors such that is the vector of the components of with respect to the ordered basis . Thus, the element of is nothing but the number , where now denotes the Euclidean inner product on (we use the same notation for the inner products on and , since this will be clear from context).</p><p>Suppose the proposition were not true, that is, that there exist sequences and of signals in such that and (92) but such that (93) for some constant , for some sequence of , and for all unitary . Let and be the vectors in given by Note that the hypothesis (92) and the fact that imply that and that , so that and vary in compact sets. Choose subsequences , that converge to points and in . By the continuity of inner products on , these satisfy and (94) for all . Here, , are the vectors formed by components through of and , respectively.</p><p>Equation (94) just means that there exists a unitary linear transformation on which maps to for each . By the continuity of , this means that for a large enough index , we have that , where denotes vector norm on . This relation can be used to construct a unitary operator on which violates (93). Let and be the subspaces of spanned by and , respectively, and let and be the orthonormal bases of and , respectively which were used to construct the vectors and , possibly augmented to ensure that their dimension is . Extend these to (countable) orthonormal bases for the separable Hilbert space by adjoining to them the sets of orthonormal vectors and , respectively. The map is defined on the basis of as follows.</p><p>• Suppose is the standard basis vector in , for ; let . Then, is defined as for .</p></div>

Also since the finite-dimensional linear transformation is unitary, we have by the previous construction that is unitary.</p><p>The previous lemma and proposition now imply the following Lemma 5: Suppose and that for some and . Also, suppose that and that is supported on the time interval for some . Then, there exists a number and unitary operators such that (95) and a contractive operator such that (96) on the interval . Here, as before, , and . Moreover, by choosing large enough, the following inequalities can also be satisfied:</p><p>We remark that although and live in different spaces, the notation makes sense by embedding the space in in the natural way. We find it convenient to abuse notation in this way; we do so without further comment. For the proof of Lemma 5, note that though the and do not have finite support in general, they can be truncated (with an arbitrarily long but finite support ) so that they satisfy the conditions of the lemma.
