<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we extend our previous results on coordinated control of rotating rigid bodies to the case of teams with heterogeneous agents. We assume that only a certain subgroup of the agents (the leaders) is vested with the main control objective, that is, maintain constant relative orientation amongst themselves. The other members of the team must meet relaxed control specifications, namely, maintain their respective orientations within certain bounds, dictated by the orientation of the leaders. The proposed control laws respect the limited information each rigid body has with respect to the rest of its peers (leaders or followers), as well as with the rest of the team. Each rigid body is equipped with a feedback control law that utilizes the Laplacian matrix of the associated communication graph, and which encodes the limited communication capabilities between the team members. Similarly to the single integrator case, the convergence of the system relies on the connectivity of the communication graph.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Cooperative distributed control strategies for multiple vehicles have gained increased attention in recent years in the control community, owing to the fact that such strategies provide attractive solutions to large-scale multi-agent problems, both in terms of complexity in the formulation of the problem, as well as in terms of the computational load required for its solution.</p><p>A typical control objective for a team of agents is the stateagreement or consensus problem. This control objective has been extensively pursued in recent years. Several results are based on treating the vehicle as a single integrator <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> or double integrator <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A recent review of the various approaches for solving the consensus problem when the underlying dynamics are linear can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. A common analysis tool that is used to model these distributed systems is algebraic graph theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Extending the previous results to systems whose dynamics are nonlinear is, in general, a nontrivial task. A large and important class (in terms of applications) of systems whose dynamics are nonlinear are systems of rotating rigid bodies. Motivated by the fact that -despite the nonlinear dynamics -linear controllers can stabilize a single rigid body <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, in this paper we propose a control strategy that exploits graph theoretic tools for cooperative control of multiple rigid bodies. We extend our previous work in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to address the case of teams with heterogeneous agents. For some applications (i.e., earth monitoring or stellar observation using a satellite cluster with a large baseline) it may be necessary for some satellites to acquire and maintain a certain (perhaps nonzero) relative orientation among themselves. A primary control objective is therefore to stabilize a subgroup of the team (leaders) to certain relative orientations. The orientations of the rest of the team (followers) are to remain within a certain orientation boundary, determined -in this case -by the convex hull of the leaders' orientations. At the same time, each agent is allowed to communicate its state (orientation and angular velocity) only with certain members of the team. These constraints limit the information exchange between the agents. The control laws for each agent proposed in this paper respect this limited information each rigid body has with respect to the rest of the team (leader or followers). A preliminary version of the paper appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>We should mention that cooperative control of multiple rigid bodies has been addressed recently by many authors, notably <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. While these papers use distributed consensus algorithms to achieve the desired objective, the specific algebraic graph theoretic framework (that is, the use of graph Laplacians) encountered in this work has not been considered in these papers. Recall that the Laplacian matrix encodes the limited communication capabilities between team members. Similarly to the linear case, the convergence of the multi-agent system relies on the connectivity of the communication graph. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">System and problem definition</head><p>We consider a team of N rigid bodies (henceforth called agents) indexed by the set N = {1, . . . , N} . The dynamics of the ith agent are given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">J i ωi = S (ω i ) J i ω i + u i , i ∈ N ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ω i ∈ R 3 is the angular velocity vector, u i ∈ R 3 is the external torque vector, and J i ∈ R 3×3 is the symmetric inertia matrix of the ith agent, all expressed in the ith agent's body-fixed frame. The matrix S(•) denotes a skew-symmetric matrix representing the cross product between two vectors, i.e., S(v</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1 )v 2 = -v 1 × v 2 .</formula><p>In this paper, the orientation of the rigid bodies with respect to the inertial frame will be described in terms of the Modified Rodriguez Parameters (MRPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The MRP vector σ ∈ R 3 is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">σ = η tan φ 4 , -2π &lt; φ &lt; 2π , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where η is the eigenaxis unit vector and φ is the eigenangle corresponding to the given orientation (via Euler's theorem).</p><p>We hasten to point out that this choice can be made without loss of generality. If necessary, the analysis in terms of quaternions can be carried out by the interested reader mutatis mutandis following the developments below. The use of the MRPs, nonetheless, simplifies the analysis and the ensuing formulas, since there is no additional equality constraint to worry about, as for the quaternion case. Another advantage of the MRPs is the fact that they can parameterize eigenaxis rotations up to 360 deg, as evident from (2). In contrast, other three-dimensional parameterizations are limited to eigenaxis rotations of less than 180 deg; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> for more details.</p><p>Let σ ∈ R 3 denote the MRP parameter vector that represents the orientation of a rigid body with respect to the inertial frame. The corresponding rotation matrix that relates inertial vector coordinates to the body-fixed coordinates is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R(σ ) = I 3 + 4 (1 -σ T σ ) (1 + σ T σ ) 2 S(σ ) + 8 (1 + σ T σ ) 2 S 2 (σ ).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Using the MRPs the kinematics of the ith agent are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">σi = G (σ i ) ω i , i ∈ N ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where G : R 3 → R 3×3 is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">G (σ i ) := 1 2 1 -σ i T σ i 2 I 3 -S (σ i ) + σ i σ i T .</formula><p>The matrix G(σ i ) has the following properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">σ i T G (σ i ) ω i = 1 + σ i T σ i 4 σ i T ω i ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">G (σ i ) G T (σ i ) = 1 + σ i T σ i 4 2 I 3 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>We assume that the team admits a leader-follower architecture. Specifically, we assume that the agents belong to either one of the two following subsets, namely, the subset of leaders N l , or the subset of followers N f . Subsequently, N l</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∩ N f = ∅ and N l ∪ N f = N .</formula><p>A primary objective of each leader is to converge to a desired relative orientation with respect to the rest of the leaders. We assume that each leader i ∈ N l is assigned a specific subset N l i ⊆ N l from the rest of the leaders, called the ith's (leader) agent leader communication set. This is the set of leaders the ith leader can communicate with, in order to achieve the desired objective, namely, to be stabilized in desired relative orientations σ d ij with respect to each member j ∈ N l i . It is assumed that the communication topology with respect to N l i for all i ∈ N l is bidirectional, in the sense that j ∈ N l i if and only if i ∈ N l j for all i, j ∈ N l , i = j.</p><p>A secondary objective is for the leaders to ''drag'' the followers along, so that, at the final leader configuration, the latter are ''contained'' within the convex hull of the leader orientations. This is a sub-case of the containment control problem dealt with in multi-agent systems, which has been encountered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The reader is referred to that reference for a discussion on specific applications of the containment problem. For this objective, both the leaders and the followers are assigned to a specific subset N i ⊆ N from the rest of the team called ith's (leader or follower) agent leader-follower communication set. This is the set of other agents the ith agent can communicate with, in order to achieve the desired objective (that is, containment of the followers' final orientations in the convex hull of the leaders' orientations). For this case we assume that the sets N i , N l i are disjoint, i.e. N i ∩</p><p>N l i = ∅, for all i ∈ N l . Hence, for the containment objective the leader-follower communication set of each leader contains only followers. However, the leader-follower communication set of each follower may contain both leaders and followers.</p><p>The previous two control objectives can be encoded by two different communication graphs, which are defined with respect to the limited communication of all the agents as follows:</p><p>(1) The leader communication graph G l</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">:= {V l , E l , C } is the undirected graph consisting of: (i) the set of vertices V l = N l indexed by the leaders of the multi-agent team, (ii) a set of edges, E l = {(i, j) ∈ V l × V l |i ∈ N l j } containing pairs</formula><p>of nodes that represent inter-leader formation specifications, and (iii) the set of labels</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">C = {σ d ij }, where (i, j) ∈ E l ,</formula><p>that specify the desired inter-agent relative orientations in the leader formation configuration.</p><p>(2) The leader-follower communication graph G := {V , E} is the undirected graph that consists of (i) a set of vertices V = N indexed by the team members, and (ii) a set of edges, E = {(i, j) ∈ V × V |i ∈ N j } containing the pairs of nodes that represent inter-agent communication specifications.</p><p>As an example, suppose that for a seven-agent team whose members are indexed by N = 1, . . . , 7, we have N l = {1, 2, 3}, N f = {4, 5, 6, 7} and the communication sets are defined as </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">N l 1 = {2}, N l 2 = {1, 3}, N l 3 = {2} and N 1 = {4, 5}, N 2 = {5}, N 3 = {6, 7}, N 4 = {1}, N 5 = {1, 2, 6}, N 6 = {3,</formula></div>

A path of length r from a vertex i to a vertex j is a sequence of r + 1 distinct vertices starting from i and ending at j, such that consecutive vertices are adjacent.

Assume that the leader-follower communication graph is connected and that the subset of leaders is nonempty.

Let u, ω, σ ∈ R 3N be the stack vectors of all the control inputs, the angular velocities and the orientations of the multiagent team, respectively. Consider the nonnegative function</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">V (σ , ω) := N i=1 1 2 ω i T J i ω i + 1 2 σ T (L ⊗ I 3 ) σ</formula><p>as a candidate Lyapunov function, where L is the Laplacian of leader-follower communication graph G. From (1) we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">ω i T J i ωi = ω i T S (ω i ) J i ω i + ω i T u i = ω i T u i</formula><p>for all i ∈ N , due to the definition of S(ω i ). The time derivative of V is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">V (σ , ω) = N i=1 ω i T J i ωi + σ T (L ⊗ I 3 ) σ = N i=1 u T i ω i + j∈N i σ i -σ j T G (σ i ) ω i ,</formula><p>and since ω i = 0, for all i ∈ N l , substituting u i from (8) we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">V (σ , ω) = i∈N f ω i T u i + G T (σ i ) j∈N i σ i -σ j = - i∈N f ω i T j∈N i ω i -ω j .</formula><p>Quoting again the fact that ω i = 0, for all i ∈ N l , we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">i∈N f ω i T j∈N i ω i -ω j = N i=1 ω i T j∈N i ω i -ω j = ω T (L ⊗ I 3 ) ω so that V (σ , ω) = -ω T (L ⊗ I 3 ) ω ≤ 0.</formula><p>The last inequality implies, in particular, that V remains bounded. We first show that the level sets of V define compact sets in the product space of the angular velocities and relative orientations of the agents. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Specifically, the set Ω c = {(ω, σ ) : V (σ , ω) ≤ c} for c &gt; 0 is closed by the continuity of V . For all (ω, σ ) ∈ Ω c we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">ω i T J i ω i ≤ 2c ⇒ ω i ≤ 2c λ min (J i ) .</formula><p>Furthermore, we also have</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">σ T (L ⊗ I 3 ) σ ≤ 2c ⇒ 1 2 N i=1 j∈N i σ i -σ j 2 ≤ 2c.</formula><p>Hence,</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">σ i -σ j 2 ≤ 4c, ∀ (i, j) ∈ E,</formula><p>where E is the edge set of the leader-follower communication graph G.

Hence</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">σ i -σ j ≤ 2 √ c (N -1)</formula><p>, for all i, j ∈ N . Using now the fact that σ i = σ d i for all i ∈ N l we can show that the set Ω c is also bounded in the space of absolute orientations. This is obviously true for the leaders which are static, while for each follower j ∈ N f and any leader i ∈ N l we have σ j -</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">σ d i ≤ 2 √ c (N -1) which implies that σ j ≤ 2 c (N -1) + σ d * , ∀j ∈ N f , where σ d * max i∈N l σ d i .</formula><p>Hence the stack vector σ remains bounded. In essence, the set Ω c is closed and bounded in the product space of the agents' angular velocities and absolute orientations. By LaSalle's invariance principle, the system converges to the largest invariant set inside the set</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">M := (ω, σ ) : ω T (L ⊗ I 3 ) ω = 0 . Since L ⊗ I 3 is positive semidefinite, if follows that (L ⊗ I 3 )ω = 0, which implies that Lω 1 = Lω 2 = Lω 3 = 0,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 ∈ R N are the stack vectors of the three coefficients of the agents' angular velocities, respectively. Connectivity of the leader-follower communication graph implies that L has a simple zero eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector -→ 1 . Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">9</ref>)</p><p>now implies that ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 are eigenvectors of the matrix L that correspond to the zero eigenvalue, thus they belong to span{ -→ 1 }. Hence ω i = ω j for all i, j ∈ N , implying that all ω i 's converge to a common value ω * at steady state. Since ω i = 0 for all i ∈ N l , we have that ω * = 0, and hence all agents assume zero angular velocities. By virtue of (1), the control inputs of all followers tend to zero, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">u i = -G T (σ i ) j∈N i σ i -σ j = 0, which implies that G (σ i ) G T (σ i ) j∈N i σ i -σ j = 0 or 1 + σ i T σ i 4 2 j∈N i σ i -σ j = 0</formula><p>and finally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">j∈N i σ i -σ j = 0, ∀i ∈ N f .</formula><p>Hence, we deduce that the agents' orientations, at steady state, satisfy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">Lσ 1 i = Lσ 2 i = Lσ 3 i , i ∈ N f σ i = σ d i , i ∈ N l .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The solutions of (10) have been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In particular, Theorem 2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> states that for a connected leader-follower communication graph and a nonempty set of leaders, the orientation of each follower, as given by the solution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, lies in the convex hull of the leaders' orientations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Leader relative orientation control design</head><p>In this section we present a control algorithm that drives the team of leaders to the desired relative orientations. This is a problem that resembles the formation control problem in multivehicle systems. The relative orientation for each pair of leaders may be different, and is dictated by the mission requirements. We impose the condition that, for each pair (i, j) ∈ E l , there exists a desired relative orientation σ ij d ∈ R 3 , to which the corresponding pair of leaders (i, j) ∈ E l must converge (see again footnote one on our nonstandard definition of the relative orientation between two agents). In what follows, we provide a control law that respects the limited communication requirements dictated by the leader communication graph G l in order to achieve this objective.</p><p>We first assume that a leader α ∈ N l plays the role of a reference attitude with respect to which the desired relative orientations should be fulfilled.

Since ω α = 0, this common angular velocity is zero. We thus have shown that ω i = 0 for all i ∈ N l at steady state. This in turn implies that u i = 0 for all i ∈ N l , and following again the arguments of the proof of Theorem 1, we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">j∈N l i σ i -σ j -σ d ij = 0, ∀i ∈ N l \ {α}</formula><p>at steady state.

For all i ∈ N l \ {α}, let σ d i denote the desired orientation of the ith leader with respect to the global coordinate frame.

The fact that the leader communication graph G l is connected implies that the matrix L l has a simple zero eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector the vector of ones. This guarantees that each one of the vectors σ 1 , σ 2 , σ 3 is an eigenvector of L l belonging to span{ -→ 1 }. Therefore, all σi are equal to a common vector value, say c. Hence σi = c for all i ∈ N l , which implies that σ i -σ j = σ d ij , where j ∈ N l i , for all i ∈ N l . We conclude that the leaders converge to the desired, specified configuration of relative orientations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">The case of lack of a global objective</head><p>In this section we assume that no global objective is imposed by the team of leaders. In particular, we assume that N l = ∅. The objective is to build distributed algorithms that drive the team of multiple rigid bodies to a common constant orientation with zero angular velocities.</p><p>In order to ensure that all agents converge to the same constant orientation, in this section we show that it is sufficient that one agent has a damping element on the angular velocity. Without loss of generality, we assume that this is agent i = 1. In contrast, the control design of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> assumes that all agents have a damping element in their angular velocity. The following theorem is the main result of this section: Theorem 3. Assume that the leader-follower communication graph is connected. Then the control strategy</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">u i = -G T (σ i ) j∈N i σ i -σ j - j∈N i ω i -ω j -a i ω i , (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_56">)</formula><p>where i = 1, . . . , N and a i = 1 if i = 1, and a i = 0 otherwise, drives the rigid bodies to the same constant orientation with zero angular velocities.</p><p>Proof. We choose again</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">V (σ , ω) := N i=1 1 2 ω i T J i ω i + 1 2 σ T (L ⊗ I 3 ) σ</formula><p>as a candidate Lyapunov function. Differentiating with respect to time, and after some algebraic manipulation, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">V (σ , ω) = -ω T (L ⊗ I 3 ) ω -ω 1 2</formula><p>≤ 0. It follows that ω remains bounded. By LaSalle's invariance principle, the system converges to the largest invariant set inside the set Similarly to the proof of Theorem 1, the condition ω T (L ⊗ I 3 ) ω = 0 guarantees that all ω i 's converge to a common value. Since ω 1 = 0, this common value is zero. Following now the same steps as in the last part of the proof of Theorem 1, we conclude that the system reaches a configuration in which j∈N i σ i -σ j = 0 for all i ∈ N , and thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">M := (σ , ω) : ω T (L ⊗ I 3 ) ω = 0 ∧ (ω 1 = 0) .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_60">(L ⊗ I 3 ) σ = 0.</formula><p>Connectivity of the leader-follower communication graph implies now that, at steady state, the agents attain a common constant orientation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Numerical example</head><p>In this section we present a numerical example that supports the theoretical developments.</p><p>The simulation involves four rigid bodies indexed from 1 to 4. We assume that there are two leaders N l = {1, 2} and two followers N f = {3, 4}. We further assume that leader 1 is the reference point, and according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> we have σ 1 = σ d . The control law of leader 2 is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. The communication sets of the followers are given by N 3 = {1, 4} and N 4 = {2, 3} and their control laws by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. The inertia matrices of the four rigid bodies have been chosen here as J 1 = diag (18, 12, 10), J 2 = diag (22, 16, 12), J 3 = diag (17, 14, 12) and J 4 = diag (15, 13, 8). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the plots of the angular velocities and orientations of the four rigid bodies with respect to time in all three coordinates. We observe that the system behaves as expected. The angular velocities converge to zero. The orientations of the leaders converge to the desired relative value while the orientations of the followers converge to the convex hull of the leaders' final orientations. For this example, this implies that the final orientations of the followers 3, 4 converge to values that are between the final values of the two leaders 1, 2 in all three orientation coordinates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>We propose distributed control strategies that exploit graph theoretic tools for cooperative rotational control of multiple rigid bodies. We assume that the agents are divided into leaders and followers. The leaders must maintain certain relative orientations with respect to each other, while the followers' orientations are to remain within a certain region that is dictated by the orientations of the leaders. Similarly to the case with linear agent dynamics, the convergence of the system was shown to rely on the connectivity of the communication graph. In the case of absence of any leader, we have constructed control laws that drive all the members of the team to a common orientation with zero angular velocities. Results from numerical simulations were also included that illustrate the theory. Further research efforts will concentrate on the case of switching interconnection topology, as well as the case of unidirectional communication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
