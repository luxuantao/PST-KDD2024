<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>An online calibration approach that jointly estimates demand and supply parameters of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) systems is presented and empirically validated through an extensive application. The problem can be formulated as a nonlinear state-space model. Because of its nonlinear nature, the resulting model cannot be solved by the Kalman filter, and therefore, nonlinear extensions need to be considered. The following three extensions to the Kalman filtering algorithm are presented: 1) the extended Kalman filter (EKF); 2) the limiting EKF (LimEKF); and 3) the unscented Kalman filter. The solution algorithms are applied to the on-line calibration of the state-of-the-art DynaMIT DTA model, and their use is demonstrated in a freeway network in Southampton, U.K. The LimEKF shows accuracy that is comparable to that of the best algorithm but with vastly superior computational performance. The robustness of the approach to varying weather conditions is demonstrated, and practical aspects are discussed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>A classical technique for dealing with dynamic systems is state-space modeling. In this section, the on-line calibration problem is formulated as a state-space model, comprising the following types of equations:</p><p>1) transition equations that capture the evolution of the state vector over time; 2) measurement equations that capture the mapping of the state vector on the measurements: a priori values of the model parameters provide direct measurements of the unknown parameters, whereas surveillance information can be used to formulate indirect measurement equations, where the output of a simulator function S (when the unknown set of parameter values is used as input) would match the surveillance information. The concept of the state (or state vector) is fundamental in the description of a state-space model. The state vector X h is defined as the minimal set of data that is sufficient to uniquely describe the dynamic behavior of the system at time interval h (the assumption of a discrete stochastic dynamic system is made). The state vector includes the parameters that need to be calibrated during time interval h. The main parameters for the on-line calibration problem for a DTA system may include OD flows, speed-density relationship parameters, and segment capacities. It should be noted, however, that the approach is general and can easily incorporate a different set of parameters.</p><p>Suppose that the model parameters and inputs have been estimated from historical data for several previous days or months. These already-estimated (demand and supply) parameters embody a wealth of information about the relationships that affect trip making and traffic dynamics, as well as their temporal and spatial evolution. It is desirable to incorporate as much historical information into the formulation as possible. The most straightforward way to achieve this is to use deviations of the model parameters from best available estimates instead of the actual parameters themselves as state variables. Thus, the model formulation would indirectly take into account all the available a priori structural information. The use of deviations has been proposed by Ashok and Ben-Akiva <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for the OD estimation and prediction problem and subsequently used, e.g., by Ashok and Ben-Akiva <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Using deviations also has other benefits. Traffic flow variables have skewed distributions (unlike the normal distribution, which is symmetric). On the other hand, the corresponding deviations of these variables from available estimates would have symmetric distributions and, hence, are more amenable to approximation by a normal distribution. A normal distribution for the model variables is a useful property for the available statistical tools such as some of the Kalman filter extensions used in this research (the UKF does not require a normal distribution).</p><p>The state vector X can, therefore, be expressed as deviations from best historical (H) values:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆X h = X h -X H h .</formula><p>The transition equation can easily be formulated with respect to the (new) state vector as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X h+1 -X H h+1 = h q=h-p F h+1 q X q -X H q + η h ⇒ ∆X h+1 = h q=h-p F h+1 q • ∆X q + η h (1)</formula><p>where F h+1 q is the autoregressive factors that capture the impact of the state vector during time interval q on the state vector during interval h + 1, η h is a vector of random error terms, and p is the degree of the autoregressive process.</p><p>Similarly, the direct measurement equation can be written in deviations' form as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X a h -X H h = X h -X H h + v h ⇒ ∆X a h = ∆X h + v h (2)</formula><p>where X a h is the vector of a priori parameters for time interval h, and v h is a vector of random error terms, uncorrelated with η h .</p><p>It should be noted that X a h and X H h capture essentially the same entity: an available estimate of the state vector. However, there are subtle differences and-in the interest of generality-a distinction is made. For example, the a priori parameters X a h may correspond to the parameters obtained from the off-line calibration, whereas the historical parameters X H h may refer to the latest available estimates (e.g., values obtained from the same interval the previous day).</p><p>Finally, the indirect measurement equation can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">M h -M H h = S (X h ) -M H h + υ h ⇒ ∆M h = S X H h + ∆X h -M H h + υ h (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where S represents the simulation model, and υ h is a vector of random error terms, uncorrelated with η h . Furthermore, the historical traffic measurement vector M H h can be obtained from an evaluation of the historical parameters X H h as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">M H h = S X H h . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>Both direct and indirect measurement equations can be constructed for any model parameter, depending on the available observations. The complete on-line calibration model, which is expressed in deviations' form [where <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> is the transition equation, and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and (3) are the measurement equations], is therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∆X h+1 = h q=h-p F h+1 q • ∆X q + η h ∆X a h = ∆X h + v h ∆M h = S X H h + ∆X h -M H h + υ h . (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>This model is nonlinear due to (3), which-in general-does not even have an analytical representation, as it involves the simulation model S. More details on the on-line calibration framework can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SOLUTION APPROACHES</head><p>The Kalman filter is the optimal minimum mean square error (mmse) estimator for linear state-space models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. However, the on-line calibration approach is nonlinear (due to the indirect measurement equation). The most straightforward extension is the EKF, in which optimal quantities are approximated via firstorder Taylor series expansion (linearization) of the appropriate equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>. The EKF has found several applications in the field of ITS, including, e.g., on-line calibration of traffic dynamics models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, short-term travel time prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and modeling of car-following driver behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. A special case of the EKF with very favorable computational properties is the limiting EKF (LimEKF). The UKF <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> is an alternative filter. The UKF has found several applications in the field of ITS, e.g., in data fusion for cooperative driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>, on-line calibration of traffic dynamics models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and real-time traffic state estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. The main difference between the EKF and UKF lies in the representation of the random variables for propagation through the system dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. EKF</head><p>The EKF employs a linearization of the nonlinear relationship to approximate the measurement equation. In other words, the EKF main steps are given as follows. Suppose that a starting estimate of the state X 0 is available (6), along with an estimate of the initial state variance-covariance matrix P 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. A time update phase makes a prediction of the state <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> and its covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> for the next time interval. The number of time intervals is denoted by N . Q h and R h are the covariance matrices for the measurement and transition equations, respectively, for time interval h. The measurement update phase incorporates the new information about the measurement vector Y h and uses it to correct the prediction of the state made during the time update. Y h corresponds to ∆M h in Section III.</p><p>The measurement matrix H h is obtained through an intermediate linearization step <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> of the nonlinear function h(•). Instrumental in this process is the Kalman gain G h , which is computed per <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. The state can then be updated (corrected) using <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Similarly, the state covariance is updated using <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Further information on the EKF can be found in many texts, including, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>end for</head><p>The on-line calibration formulation presented in Section III does not, in general, have an analytical representation. Therefore, to perform the linearization step <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, it is necessary to use numerical derivatives. Assuming the use of central derivatives, it is necessary to evaluate the function 2n times, where n is the dimension of the state vector. (If forward derivatives are used, then this number drops to n + 1 evaluations.) Each such evaluation implies one run of the simulator. Therefore, it becomes apparent that this process of linearization dominates the computational complexity of the algorithm. Another costly operation is the inversion required for the computation of the Kalman gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. LimEKF</head><p>In real-time applications, it may be possible to replace the Kalman gain matrix G h by a fixed gain matrix, considerably decreasing the computation time. This approach is described in the context of the Kalman filter in Chui and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref> and applied in practice in the literature for the EKF (e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref>). The limiting Kalman filter is defined by replacing G h with its "limit" G, called the limiting (or stable) Kalman gain matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>. The main steps of the LimEKF algorithm are presented in Algorithm 2. The differences from the EKF algorithm are limited to the computation of the numerical derivative (which is not computed on-line in the LimEKF) and the use of the limiting Kalman gain G for every iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p></div>

Several strategies are envisioned in the context of the DTA application for the calculation of an appropriate gain matrix. In practice, a real-time DTA system is applied in a rolling horizon framework, with state estimation periodically taking place (e.g., every 15 min, or as conditions warrant). The limiting Kalman gain matrix can be computed off-line-inbetween applications of the DTA, e.g., as a function of the (actual) gain matrices from previous intervals. Such an approximation is expected to be viable in many situations, particularly given that the proposed formulation is based on the concept of deviations. Depending on the situation, it is also possible to develop, from historical data, a stable Kalman gain matrix for specific periods (e.g., from the transition from off-peak to peak, then peak, then peak to off-peak, and so on).</p><p>The evaluation of these strategies and the determination of the conditions under which the application of the LimEKF is appropriate are outside the scope of this paper. Further research and empirical analyses are required to determine the best strategy for various conditions to avoid information loss and performance degradation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. UKF</head><p>The UKF <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> is an alternative filter for dynamic statespace models. The UKF uses a deterministic sampling approach [unscented transformation (UT)] to represent a random variable by using a number of deterministically selected sample points (often called sigma points). These points capture the mean and covariance of the random variable and, when propagated through the true nonlinear system, capture the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the second order (Taylor series expansion).</p><p>The UT seeks to find a parameterization that would capture the mean and covariance information while, at the same time, permitting the direct propagation of the information through an arbitrary set of nonlinear equations. This can be accomplished by generating a discrete distribution that has the same first and second (and possibly higher) moments, where each point in the discrete approximation can be directly transformed. The mean and covariance of the transformed ensemble can then be computed as the estimate of the nonlinear transformation of the original distribution. As the filter only propagates the mean and the variance of the distribution, some information loss may occur when applied to non-Gaussian distributions.</p><p>Given an n-dimensional distribution with covariance P, it is possible to generate O(n) points with the same sample covariance from the columns (or rows) of the matrices ± √ nP (the positive and negative roots). This set of points has a zero mean. However, simply adding the mean x of the original distribution to each of the points yields a symmetric set of 2n points with the desired mean and covariance.</p><p>The main steps of the UT for calculating the statistics of a random variable that undergoes a nonlinear transformation (e.g., y h = f (x h )) are presented in Algorithm 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. Let the n-dimensional random variable x h with covariance matrix P x,h denote the state for time interval h. Since this algorithm also considers the covariance of the measurement vector P y,h during interval h and the covariance of the state and measurement vectors P xy,h , the covariance of the state vector will be denoted as P x,h = P h to avoid confusion.</p><p>To calculate the statistics of y, a matrix X is generated using 2n + 1 weighted sigma points.</p><p>κ ∈ R is a scaling parameter, and ( (n + κ)P x,h ) i is the ith row or column of the matrix square root of (n + κ)P x,h . A Cholesky decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref> can be used for this step. The value of the scaling parameter κ has a direct effect on the scaling of the points and is an input to the algorithm. The constant a determines the spread of the sigma points around x and is usually set to 0.0001 ≤ a ≤ 1. b is used to incorporate prior knowledge of the distribution of x (for Gaussian distributions, b = 2 is optimal). The weights are not time dependent and do not need to be recomputed for every time interval.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>end for</head><p>The main steps of the UKF are presented in Algorithm 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. The initialization step uses the UT (Algorithm 3) to generate the 2n + 1 sigma points and appropriate weights for the mean and covariance computations. A time and measurement update step is repeated for each run of the algorithm. The first step in the time update phase is the propagation of the sigma points through the transition equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. The prior estimate of the state vector is computed as a weighted sum of the propagated sigma points <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. A similar approach is used for the prior estimate of the state covariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. The true measurement equation is used to transform the sigma points into a vector of respective measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. The measurement vector is computed as a weighted sum of the generated measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</p><p>The computation of the Kalman gain (and, consequently, the "correction" phase of the filtering) is based on the covariance of the measurement vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> and the covariance of the state and measurement vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. APPLICATION</head><p>The objective of this application is to compare different nonlinear Kalman filter extensions with respect to their applicability to the problem of on-line calibration of DTA models. The on-line calibration has been implemented and demonstrated as it applies to the state-of-the-art DynaMIT DTA system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Three algorithms have been implemented (i.e., EKF, LimEKF, and UKF), and their performance for a 35-km-long freeway network in Southampton, U.K., is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Network and Data</head><p>The network, whose schematic is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, has eight on-ramps and seven off-ramps; traffic is loaded through 20 ODs, and speed, density, and count data are obtained from ten sensors. The network is coded using 45 segments, which, for the purposes of speed-density parameter calibration, are grouped into three classes. The 20 ODs include the mainline, the flows between the mainline and the seven off-ramps, the flows between the eight on-ramps and the mainline, as well as four intermediate OD flows (from an on-ramp to an off-ramp).</p><p>The state vector for the on-line calibration consists of OD flows, segment capacities, and speed-density relationship parameters. The total dimension is 80, which is broken down as follows:</p><p>1) 20 OD flows; 2) 45 segment capacities; 3) 15 speed-density relationship parameters: a speeddensity relationship (and, therefore, five parameters, namely, free-flow speed, minimum and jam density, and exponents α and β) has been defined for each of the three segment types. The period of analysis comprises six intervals of 15 min (i.e., from 16:15 to 17:45). A warm-up period of 75 min (from 15:00 to 16:15) is used to ensure that the network is adequately loaded. The choice of the 15-min duration for the estimation and prediction intervals was motivated by practical reasons (such as the stability of the estimated speed-density relationships) and previous empirical tests of the authors with different interval durations (in other networks), during which, it was found that a larger number of shorter (e.g., 5 min) prediction intervals does not provide any benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>. The measurement vector for each 15-min interval consisted of 390 elements, which are broken down as follows:</p><p>1) ten 15-min count measurements (one per sensor per interval); 2) 150 minute-by-minute speed measurements (one per sensor per minute); 3) 150 minute-by-minute density measurements (one per sensor per minute); 4) 80 elements of the a priori state vector. The transition fractions that were estimated during the offline calibration (using the approach presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>) were used for the OD flows. The degree of the autoregressive process for the OD flows was found to be equal to two. For the supply parameters, a degree of one was used for the autoregressive process. Furthermore, variance/covariance matrices were estimated based on the output of the off-line calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experimental Design</head><p>The two dimensions (or factors) that are used in the experimental design are listed as follows.</p><p>1) scope of the on-line calibration, i.e., whether only demand parameters are updated or whether both demand and supply parameters are jointly updated; 2) type of day for which the on-line calibration approach is applied: A distinction is made between two types of days based on the prevailing weather conditions, namely, days with dry weather and days with wet weather. The situation when only the demand parameters are calibrated on-line is used as the base. Since this problem is the usual OD estimation problem, generalized least squares or Kalman filtering algorithms can be applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. When both the demand and supply parameters are jointly updated on-line, however, the problem cannot be analytically represented, and the algorithms presented in Section IV can be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Off-Line Calibration</head><p>Since an off-line calibration was not available for this network, the first step in this case study was to perform an off-line calibration. Data from five weekdays (without wet weather or incidents) during the first two weeks of September 2001 were used, and a sequential off-line calibration approach was followed. Supply parameters were first calibrated. Speed-density relationship parameters were obtained by fitting speed and density data to the appropriate functional form. Speed-density relationship parameters were obtained by using the following nonlinear regression to fit speed and density data to the speed-density relationship used by DynaMIT:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">u = u f 1 - max(0, K -K min ) K jam β α (<label>33</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_53">)</formula><p>where u denotes the speed, u f is the free-flow speed, K is the density, K min is the minimum density, K jam is the jam density, and α and β are model parameters. The 45 segments of the network were split into three groups with homogeneous characteristics. The mainline segments were classified into two types, whereas the ramp segments were grouped together. Segment capacities were estimated using Highway Capacity Manual guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref> (since no equivalent national guidelines are available for the U.K.). Then, using the calibrated parameters as inputs, time-dependent OD flows were estimated using a sequential OD estimation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref> on five weekdays.</p><p>The normalized root mean square (RMSN) error statistic for the off-line calibration of the counts was equal to 0.1232, whereas the fit of the speeds was equal to 0.1102. The RMSN statistic was computed using the following formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">RMSN = N N (y -ŷ) 2 N y (<label>34</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_55">)</formula><p>where N is the number of observations, y denotes an observation, and ŷ is the corresponding estimated (predicted) value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. On-Line Calibration Results</head><p>Results for estimated and predicted speeds are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. The base row provides the performance when only demand parameters are estimated on-line. The next three rows show the results obtained when demand and supply parameters are jointly estimated (each row corresponds to one of the considered algorithms). Absolute RMSN values are reported, as well as percent improvement from the base case. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows the results for estimated and predicted counts.  These results indicate that the joint calibration of demand and supply parameters can improve the ability of the system to accurately estimate and predict the traffic conditions. The EKF algorithm exhibits the best performance with considerable improvements in estimation and prediction accuracy (except for three-step predicted counts). A small decrease in performance (compared to the EKF)-but still a clear improvement-is obtained when the LimEKF algorithm is used. The UKF algorithm seems to have the least desirable performance. Furthermore, this algorithm is generally outperformed by the LimEKF, which has vastly better computation properties. The UKF in this application was tuned based on line searches on the main parameters, and it is possible that a more elaborate tuning approach could further improve its performance.</p><p>Similar summary results obtained under wet weather conditions are presented in Tables III (speeds) and IV (counts).</p><p>In this application, speeds are predicted better than counts. This may be evidence that some of the inputs to the process need to be further refined. Examples of such inputs that are assumed to be exogenous and come from the off-line calibration are the covariance matrices of the measurement and transition equations (Q and R) and the autoregressive fractions in the transition equation (F ). Further analysis of this aspect may be required, perhaps in the form of a sensitivity analysis of these inputs.</p><p>It should be noted that the observed speeds for the simulation period range between 80 and 120 km/h during the dry days, and the speed drops down to 60 km/h during the wet days. Although these are not very congested conditions, they are certainly not only free flow. Further applications in more congested conditions may be needed for the validation of the robustness of the presented approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Computational Performance</head><p>The computational performance of the on-line calibration approach for a simulation-based DTA system is determined largely by required the number of function evaluations. The EKF and the UKF algorithms require 2n and 2n + 1 function evaluations (and, thus, runs of the simulator), respectively (where n is the dimension of the state vector). Therefore, the two algorithms have similar computational requirements (converging as the dimension of the problem increases).</p><p>The LimEKF algorithm, on the other hand, requires a single function evaluation, irrespective of the dimension of the problem. Therefore, the computational performance of this algorithm is vastly superior to that of the other two algorithms (EKF and UKF).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">V</ref> summarizes the computational results for the three algorithms. The first column refers to the number of function evaluations per interval, where n is the dimension of the state vector, whereas the second column shows the (real) runtime for the entire simulation period, i.e., from 16:15 to 17:45 (on a Pentium IV 2.8-GHz computer with 512 MB of random access memory). The theoretical superiority of the LimEKF is thus empirically verified. Furthermore, a practical indication of the expected runtimes for real-world networks is provided. Even for networks larger than the one used in this case study, the computational requirements are expected to be realistic as the algorithm involves only one function evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Impact on Parameters</head><p>Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> visually demonstrate how the on-line calibration adjusts the model parameters, which, in this case, are the speed-density relationships. In both figures, the off-line calibrated speed-density relationship is indicated by the dashed curve. This relationship captures average traffic conditions and has been estimated using data from several days, around the clock, thus capturing a wider range of traffic patterns and conditions. As a result, it is expected that the observations during a particular day and period may not be symmetrically distributed around this average curve.</p><p>The speed-density observations under dry weather conditions (indicated by small circles) are generally above this average speed-density relationship, as drivers go faster than the average for the same density. This is reflected in the on-line calibrated speed-density relationships for the considered time intervals, indicated by the solid curves (which are only plotted for the domains that they have been estimated). Similarly, during wet weather conditions, drivers intuitively go slower for the  same density, and therefore, the speed-density observations fall below the average speed-density curve. The on-line calibrated speed-density curves once again reflect this trend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, an on-line calibration approach that jointly estimates demand and supply parameters of DTA systems has been presented and empirically validated through an extensive case study in a network in Southampton, U.K. The feasibility of the approach, as well as its marginal improvement over the state of the art, was thus demonstrated. Alternative solution approaches were compared, and recommendations were made about an algorithm that provides dramatically superior computational performance without sacrificing prediction accuracy.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that joint on-line calibration of demand and supply parameters can improve estimation and prediction accuracy of a DTA system. In the presented case study, benefits between 10% and 20% were obtained (over the case when only OD flows were estimated on-line). The magnitude of this improvement may depend on network-and application-specific circumstances. For example, one could argue that a "better" off-line calibration could have led to better a priori parameters, and therefore, the marginal improvement due to the on-line calibration might be lower. On the other hand, one can construct or select situations with very different traffic conditions (e.g., during a day with a heavy snowstorm, or during a bank holiday), which are very different than the "regular" days used for off-line calibration. It is expected that the traffic dynamics during such a time would be very different, and the ability of the system to dynamically adjust the supply parameters would lead to more pronounced improvements. It is reasonable to assume that, by selecting a typical "dry" day, we captured the expected lower bound of the improvement, whereas by selecting a day with rain (but no extreme traffic conditions), we demonstrate the robustness of the approach.</p><p>The on-line calibration approach is computationally feasible. Even when using the "exact" algorithms (EKF and UKF), the model achieves "real-time" performance in a small but nontrivial real network. Furthermore, the LimEKF provides accuracy that is comparable to that of the best algorithm (EKF), but with computational complexity that is order(s) of magnitude lower than the other algorithms. One interesting property of the LimEKF algorithm is that it requires a single function evaluation, irrespective of the dimension of the state vector (whereas the computational complexity of the EKF and UKF algorithms proportionally increases with the state dimension). Therefore, the computational benefits increase as the dimension of the problem increases.</p><p>The performance of the LimEKF is very promising in this application, and it should be further validated through additional studies, both in the DTA framework, as well as in other application domains. The development of strategies for the calculation of the limiting gain matrix under a variety of traffic conditions, as discussed in Section IV-B, is an interesting and important future research direction.</p><p>In this application, the EKF generally outperforms UKF (which may be expected to have superior performance over the EKF), whereas the UKF seems to perform better in terms of speeds than in terms of counts. Other researchers have also encountered situations where the UKF does not outperform the EKF, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that the full power of the UKF algorithm is not exploited, because the transition equation is already linear; if it was not, then an additional approximation (linearization of the transition equation) would be introduced in the solution of the EKF. Further empirical validation of the developed on-line calibration framework in other networks and additional measurements could provide additional insight.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
