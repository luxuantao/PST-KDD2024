<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study investigated employees' information systems security policy (ISSP) compliance behavioural intentions in organisations from the theoretical lenses of social bonding, social influence, and cognitive processing. Given that previous research on ISSP compliance has been based on deterrence theory, this study seeks to augment and diversify research on ISSP compliance through its theoretical perspective. Relevant hypotheses were developed to test the research conceptualisation. Data from a survey of business managers and IS professionals confirmed that social bonds that are formed at work largely influence attitudes towards compliance and subjective norms, with both constructs positively affecting employees' ISSP compliance. Employees' locus of control and capabilities and competence related to IS security issues also affect ISSP compliance behavioural intentions. Overall, the constructs in the research model enhance our understanding of the social-organisational and psychological factors that might encourage or accentuate employees' ISSP compliance in the workplace.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>To compete and survive in today's turbulent operating environments, organisations (public and private) continue to rely on and invest heavily in information systems (IS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. The protection of the information and other data assets that are held in such systems is a major concern for practitioners and has emerged as a key managerial priority <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. To protect critical IS assets, organisations often deploy security technologies, such as firewalls for perimeter defence and comprehensive monitoring systems (e.g., log management, data leak prevention, content monitoring technologies). These tools offer a technological or technical solution to the problem but are rarely sufficient in providing total protection of organisational IS resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. This is because socio-organisational imperatives are considered relevant in fostering desired outcomes for organisations in such issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>.</p><p>The onus is therefore on organisations to utilise multiperspective approaches for protecting their IS assets and resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Researchers have indicated that organisations that fail to focus on individual and other organisational issues, alongside technology-based solutions, may fail to achieve success in their efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. Despite the huge investments that organisations make in procuring IS security tools, failings related to security incidents and breaches continue to be a significant problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. One of the reasons why IS security incidents and abuses continue to plague organisations is that organisational employees are the weakest link in ensuring IS security; they constitute an insider threat to their organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. Thus, a beneficial approach to safeguarding IS resources requires that organisations focus on their own employees' intentions and behaviours.</p><p>One of the mechanisms that organisations use in shaping or influencing the behaviours of their employees with respect to how an IS is efficiently used is through the rules, guidelines, and requirements laid out in their information systems security policy (ISSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. However, the literature suggests that even if an ISSP is in place to help safeguard an organisation against the misuse, abuse, and destruction of IS assets, its employees often do not readily comply with such documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. Studies are needed to enhance our understanding of issues that may serve to inhibit or encourage ISSP compliance in organisations. Research on ISSP compliance in organisations is beginning to receive increased attention in the extant literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Anderson and Agarwal's <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> review of the literature in this area indicated that the majority of previous ISSP compliance research was carried out from the perspectives of criminological theories (i.e., general deterrence theory, rational choice theory, situational crime prevention theory) and the health belief model (i.e., protection motivation theory). While previous research efforts favouring these perspectives have advanced knowledge in the area, we contend that other theoretical underpinnings could further provide insight into ISSP compliance. We argue that organisational issues rooted in socialisation and social influence, as well as personal beliefs and cognition, can equally influence ISSP compliance behavioural intentions; others have provided similar arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>Research focusing on criminology has tended to accept sanctions and penalties as the only means by which IS misuse and abuse can be deterred <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Such studies implicitly have suggested that when violations and misbehaviours are severely punished, employees will cease to engage in such unacceptable behaviours. However, new insights have emerged that call this viewpoint into question. For instance, Vance et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, Son <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> showed that ISSP compliance research using criminology and fear appeal theories do not always explicate noncompliance behaviours. According to these researchers, when employees err, they may use neutralisation techniques to circumvent or minimise the effects of reprisals from their organisations.</p><p>To increase knowledge, this research was designed to complement the few evolving studies based on socialisation and social psychology theories in understanding ISSP compliance in organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Compliance, being a complex concept, should be studied from differing perspectives to enhance knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. That said, it is axiomatic among scholars across disciplines that the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), which encompasses Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), can explain innumerable behaviours, including ISSP compliance-related behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. In this study, we integrated the recomposed TPB with Social Bond Theory (SBT), given that the latter may be suitable for adapting the former to working environments where social bonds might influence job-related perceptions and behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Theory of planned behaviour</head><p>Social influence refers to the change in an individual's thoughts, actions, feelings, attitudes, or behaviours that results from their interactions with another individual or group <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. The Theory of Reasoned Action, from which the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was developed, underscores the social influence perspective. The TPB, which was proposed by Ajzen <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, postulates that individual behaviour is influenced by attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. Attitude is defined as the individual's positive or negative feelings towards engaging in a specified behaviour. Subjective norms describe an individual's perception of what people important to them think about a given behaviour. Perceived behavioural control is defined as the individual's beliefs regarding the efficacy and resources needed to facilitate a behaviour.</p><p>The TPB has been widely used in investigating information system's ethical behaviours and individual's decision to comply with an ISSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Consistent with such previous studies, we posit that employees' intentions to comply with an ISSP will be influenced by attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. However, we recomposed the TPB's perceived behavioural control construct by two measures related to social cognitive theory (SCT) for parsimony's sake and because the recomposed TPB tends to possess higher explanatory power <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The approach used here is consistent with those of others investigating comparable themes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Social cognitive theory</head><p>Social cognitive theory is a relevant premise for explaining human behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. SCT allows for the simultaneous and dynamic interplay between social and personal factors to be studied. SCT posits that individuals are actively engaged in their own development and obtain desired results when they believe that their actions are under their own control <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Accordingly, Workman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> decomposed SCT into two main elements; i.e., locus of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Locus of control refers to the degree to which an individual believes that he or she has the ability to control events that directly or indirectly affect them. Rotter <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> suggested that people who believe that they control their own destinies will accept responsibility for their actions. Essentially, people who feel that outcomes are beyond their control may shift the responsibility of their actions to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Self-efficacy simply refers to individuals' belief in their own competence and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It fundamentally highlights the extent to which individuals feel and think about motivating themselves to completing specific tasks or actions. Stajkovic and Luthans <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> noted that such beliefs could cause individuals to think either pessimistically or optimistically regarding accomplishing work-related tasks. Similar to prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> that used self-efficacy and locus of control to investigate computer safety behaviours, we posit that ISSP compliance will be positively enhanced when employees believe that they have the required competency and control to help them comply with their organisation's ISSP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Social bond theory</head><p>Social bond theory (SBT) describes the binding ties or social bonding that individuals have with their group <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Hirschi <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> presented four bonds by which socialisation and conformity are promoted; i.e., attachment, commitment, involvement, and personal norms. The theory postulates that when people build upon such bonds, their urge to indulge in antisocial or antiestablishment behaviours is reduced. In the context of this research, attachment refers to the identification with organisational values vis-a `-vis ISSP. Commitment highlights individuals' effort and energy expended to support their organisation's ISSP. Involvement refers to building relationships with other employees. Personal norms refer to an individual's own values and views of ISSP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research model and hypotheses</head><p>Following the preceding discussion, the research model is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The decision to model the effects of SBT's constructs on attitude towards compliance and subjective norms is consistent with similar research conceptualisations in the area <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. For instance, the TPB suggests that normative beliefs determine subjective norms, i.e., social influence or pressure. That is, if people believed that their referent individuals or groups (i.e., supervisors, coworkers) approved the behaviour, they would feel socially pressed to behave as expected. SBT's constructs explicitly measure social bonding in organisations and are closely related to subjective norms. In addition, attitude towards compliance benefits significantly from social information and interactions in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>; thus, where greater bonding exists, favourable personal attitudes towards what a workgroup or an organisation considers important often ensue <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. The control variables are included to enhance the insight into ISSP compliance. In particular, given the popularity of sanctions and penalties, i.e., deterrence theory, among IS security researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, we decided to include constructs from that theory as part of the control variables. The research hypotheses are discussed next.</p><p>Employees attached to their organisations and with strong ties to colleagues tend to uphold values of importance to their organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Chan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> found that employees who socialise with colleagues with respect to ISSP compliance behaviours and issues in the workplace have higher perceptions of IS security in general. Similarly, Herath and Rao <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> provided empirical evidence to support the view that social influence plays a role in shaping employee security behaviours. Knapp and Marshall <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> implied that individuals can be persuaded to adhere to organisational ISSPs if they fear their attachment to colleagues may suffer from their noncompliance with such policies. Thus, attitudes towards ISSP compliance are favourably affected when individuals socialise with their colleagues with respect to their organisation's ISSP. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed: Hypothesis 1. Attachment will have a positive effect on attitude towards ISSP compliance.</p><p>Porter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> characterised organisational commitment as a strong belief in and acceptance of an organisation's goals and values, a willingness to exert effort on behalf of the organisation, and a strong desire to maintain membership in the organisation. Accordingly, an employee with strong beliefs in their organisation's values and goals, including those related to ISSP issues will form and maintain positive attitudes about the importance of such rules and guidelines. Recent studies show that employees are less likely to engage in counterproductive IS behaviours that may compromise their organisations' IS resources if their own commitment to the organisation is high <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed: Hypothesis 2. Commitment will have a positive effect on attitude towards ISSP compliance.</p><p>Involvement simply means participation and engagement. Experts, including Thornton <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, have indicated that employees' involvement in their originations' activities, policies, and intentions boded well for the long-term success of businesses. In the context of this study, we posit that when individuals participate in meetings focusing on their organisation's ISSP and engage in personal relationships with colleagues in such matters, their attitudes towards complying with their organisation's ISSP will benefit accordingly. A study of computer abuse behaviours by Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that used similar measures as this current study showed that employees' involvement positively affected intentions and attitudes towards engagement in desired behaviours. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed: Hypothesis 3. Involvement will have a positive effect on Attitude towards ISSP compliance.</p><p>Personal norms, standards, benefits, and values matter in how an employee perceives organisational issues, including those relating to the adherence of acceptable computer behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In general, the literature has shown that personal norms have a bearing on an individual's attitude towards engaging in computer abuse and organisational IS misbehaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. It is to be expected that employees with favourable personal values and norms will form positive attitudes towards complying with their organisation's ISSP. Indeed, researchers have confirmed that personal norms, benefits and values positively influence attitudes towards engaging in and complying with acceptable computer security behaviours and guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed: Hypothesis 4. Personal norms will have a positive effect on attitude towards ISSP compliance.</p><p>As with the foregoing discussions about the impacts of SBT's constructs (i.e., Attachment, Commitment, Involvement and Personal norms) on Attitude towards compliance, we believe that similar arguments would hold for the relationships between these constructs and Subjective norms. For instance, a committed, involved worker with acceptable personal values and, having strong attachment to his or her organisational objectives, will find it agreeable and expedient to follow cues from significant others in his or her work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Indeed, workers' perceptions of organisation-wide issues, e.g., ISSP compliance, can be linked with or influenced by the viewpoints of their referent individuals or groups (i.e., supervisors, coworkers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Recent research has shown that workgroup's opinions and concerns have a bearing on ISSP compliance in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. As previously noted, Knapp and Marshall <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> found that workers may be persuaded to follow directives in their organisation's ISSP if noncompliance is perceived to arise from weak attachment. In addition, it has been shown that employees sharing a similar level of commitment as their colleagues are less likely to engage in counterproductive behaviours if their colleagues and peers are not engaged in such <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Workers who are involved with their organisation is likely to comply with their group's acceptable engagements and behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. When an employee bonds with peers in the workplace, it is likely that his or her personal norms and values will not depart from those of his or her referent individuals or groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Hence, the following hypotheses are proposed:</p><p>Hypothesis 5. Attachment will have a positive effect on Subjective norms.</p><p>Hypothesis 6. Commitment will have a positive effect on Subjective norms.</p><p>Hypothesis 7. Involvement will have a positive effect on Subjective norms.</p><p>Hypothesis 8. Personal norms will have a positive effect on Subjective norms.</p><p>In general, the attitudes that people have about an issue or act can be influenced by the views of significant others <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Thus, an employee's attitude about ISSP compliance at his or her organisation can be influenced by the pervading views of referent individuals or groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Thus, where the group's view of an issue is favourable, the individual's attitude may follow suit. In the context of IS security behaviour, Chan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Hazari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Ifinedo <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and Herath and Rao <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> found that subjective norms positively affect attitude towards compliance. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed: Hypothesis 9. Subjective norms will have a positive effect on Attitude towards ISSP compliance.</p><p>Conceptually, the TPB posits that positive attitudes influence behavioural intentions. Conversely, negative attitudes will diminish behavioural intentions. Thus, employees with positive beliefs about their organisation's ISSP will have favourable tendencies to comply with such rules and guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. On the other hand, those lacking such favourable attitudes will not readily comply with such policies. Other studies have shown that attitudes towards complying with acceptable IS behaviours positively affect behavioural intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>Hypothesis 10. Attitude towards ISSP compliance will have a positive effect on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions.</p><p>Essentially, subjective norms are normative stimuli, beliefs and motivations related to compliance with a particular act, which is largely informed by consultation or observation of the behaviours of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Indeed, individuals' behaviour is influenced or motivated by what they observe to be normal in their environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. In the context of ISSP compliance in organisations, employees are most likely to comply with their organisation's ISSP if they notice that those around them, i.e., superiors, peers, and subordinates, are complying with and abiding by such guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Pahnila et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Bulgurcu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Herath and Rao <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> found that subjective norms significantly affect ISSP compliance in organisations. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed: Hypothesis 11. Subjective norms will have a positive effect on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions.</p><p>Locus of control relates to individuals' control over events affecting them. Thus, employees who perceive to have control over issues affecting them or others tend to assume responsibility for their actions. In the context of engaging in precautionary IS measures, it has been shown that individuals with higher control perceptions are more proactive in terms of undertaking higher security precautions, such as installing and updating security and virus software, changing passwords at regular intervals, and using firewalls and backup systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Thus, employees' locus of control will have significant influence on their ISSP compliance behavioural intentions. Workman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> found locus of control to be positively related to IS security behaviours. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed: Hypothesis 12. Locus of control will have a positive effect on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions.</p><p>Self-efficacy relates to individuals' capabilities and competence to cope with a task or make a choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In particular, self-efficacy has been shown to have a significant impact on an individual's ability to accomplish tasks, including IS usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Compeau and Higgins <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> showed that people with higher self-efficacy regarding IS use are more likely to employ such systems in their work more than those with low self-efficacy. With respect to ISSP, it is logical to expect that individuals with high IS security capabilities and competence will see the need to follow organisational ISSPs and that such individuals will be better able to understand the dangers of noncompliance. Recent findings have confirmed that ISSP compliance is positively affected by selfefficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>Hypothesis 13. Self-efficacy will have a positive effect on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data collection procedure</head><p>The research model was tested using a field survey. To that end, we used two approaches in collecting our data. First, we purchased a directory containing the names of non-IS managers in Canadian organisations from a marketing and data research firm, i.e., InfoCanada. Half of the names on the list, which constituted 1000 names, were used for this study. Each participant received a cover letter, questionnaire, and self-addressed, stamped envelope. Of the 1000 questionnaires that were mailed, 106 were undelivered. In all, 76 responses were received, reflecting an effective response rate of 8.5% from this particular source. Excluding 8 incomplete and poorly completed responses, we were left with 68 responses from this source. The response rate is relatively high in light of the difficulties of collecting security-related data from organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Second, in order to increase our knowledge of ISSPs in organisations, the views of IS professionals were also obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. As we were unable to procure a list of IS professionals in Canada, we decided to use judgmental sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to collect data from such professionals. In this approach, a researcher uses their judgement to select suitable participants. We contacted the chapter heads of the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) across Canada, who we asked to direct their members to an online version of the same questionnaire that was mailed to non-IS managers (the survey was hosted by QuestionPro.com). Additionally, we used contacts to solicit participation from other IS professionals across the country. Fifty-six (56) usable responses were obtained from IS security and other IS professionals.</p><p>Both cohorts were motivated by four $100 gift certificates and a promise to share the summary of the results with them. Importantly, participation in the study was voluntary, and the respondents were assured that individual responses would be treated with anonymity and confidentiality. These incentives were necessary as it is known that individuals (and organisations) are hesitant to participate in security-related surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Thus, a total of 124 usable responses from both groups are considered adequate for an exploratory study such as this one. It is worth noting that our data sample size is comparable with those of similar studies in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>As the unit of analysis was the individual employee, common method variance (CMV) was not a problem for the study. Nonetheless, procedural remedies for controlling CMV bias were followed. Namely, clear and concise questions were used in the questionnaire, and as indicated above, to reduce apprehension, respondents' anonymity was assured. Additionally, a statistical procedure, i.e., the Harmon one-factor test, was used to assess whether such biases were indeed a problem in our sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The test results showed that several factors with eigenvalues greater than one were present in our data. The most covariance explained by one factor was our data is 24.6%, indicating that CMV was not a problem in the data.</p><p>We compared early and late respondents from both the mail and the online survey to assess whether non-response bias existed in our data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The independent t-test did not show any statistically differences between the survey's non-participants (late respondents) and participants (early respondents) regarding the characteristics of age, gender, education, job tenure at their current place of work, and occupation.</p><p>On average, the study's respondents had 10.14 years (s.d. = 9.4) of tenure at their current organisations. Some of the job title of the IS professionals included IS Directors, Chief Information Security Officers, and IS Project managers. Of the non-IS managers, job title included Chief Human Resources Officers, VPs of Marketing, and Accounts Managers. There were 68 (55%) non-IS managers and 56 (45%) IS professionals in the sample. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the job rankings (positions) and other demographic information for the respondents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Operationalisation of the constructs</head><p>The nine main constructs that were used in this study were taken from previously validated research; we adapted the measures to the ISSP compliance research context. The scales for attachment (ATCH) and involvement (INVO) were adapted from Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The scale for commitment (COMM) was adapted from Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Herath and Rao <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. For the personal norms (PERN) scale, we adapted relevant measures from Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The measures for the two constructs of attitude towards compliance with ISSPs (ATWB) and subjective norms (SUBN) were adapted from Woon and Kankanhalli <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, Bulgurcu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and Herath and Rao <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. We modified the measures from Workman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> for the locus of control (LOCC) scale.</p><p>Self-efficacy (SEFF) used measures adapted from Compeau and Higgins <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Woon and Kankanhalli <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, and Workman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The behavioural intentions (BEHI) scale included measures modified from Woon and Kankanhalli <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and Herath and Rao <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. The measurement items were mainly anchored on a 7point Likert scale, ranging from ''strongly disagree'' (1) to ''strongly agree'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, in which participants were asked to indicate an appropriate response. The questionnaire was pre-tested by knowledgeable professionals including 4 IS faculty members, 8 local IS managers and 8 non-IS managers with some experience in ISSP issues. The measurement items, individual descriptive statistics and sources of the study's scales are provided in Appendix A. The deterrence control variable items <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and scales are provided in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Data analysis and results</head><p>The partial least squares (PLS) technique of structural equation modelling, which uses a principle component-based estimation, was used for the analysis. The approach is suitable for validating predictive models, particularly those with small size samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The specific tool that was used was SmartPLS 2.0, which was created by Ringle et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. PLS supports two measurement models: (a) the assessment of the measurement model and (b) the assessment of the structural model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Assessment of the measurement model</head><p>The psychometric properties of a model are examined by the following indicators: internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Hair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> suggested that item loadings of 0.5 are adequate for these indicators; items with values lower than 0.5 were thus deleted from the scales. The composite reliability for each of the study's constructs was above the recommended level of 0.7, indicating the internal consistency of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Fornell and Larcker <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> recommended that the average variance extracted (AVE) criterion be used to assess convergent validity. These researchers suggested that an AVE value Discriminant validity is assured when the following two conditions are met: (a) the value of the AVE is above the threshold value of 0.50 and (b) the square root of the AVE is larger than all other cross-correlations. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows that the AVE ranged from 0.57 to 0.90, and in no case was any correlation between the constructs greater than the squared root of AVE (the principal diagonal element). Overall, the results showed that the study measures were psychometrically adequate for this study (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Assessment of the structural model</head><p>The structural model presents information about the path significance of hypothesised relationships using the path coefficients (b) and R squared (R 2 ). The strength of the relationship is indicated by the b. Chin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> notes that R 2 values of 0.67, 0.33, and 0.19 for the percentage of variance in a model are substantial, moderate and weak, respectively. The R 2 shows the percentage of variance in the model to give an indication of its predictive power.</p><p>The SmartPLS 2.0 results for the b and R 2 values are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> path significance levels (t-values) are estimated using the bootstrapping method. Additionally, Cohen <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> suggested that the PLS structural model can be assessed using effect sizes, f 2 . Moreover, Tenenhaus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> noted that tests for the predictive relevance of a model can be gauged from its goodness-of-fit index (GoF) and Stone-Eiser q-square (q 2 ) indicators.</p><p>According to Cohen <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, f 2 values of 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35 signify small, medium, and large effects, respectively. The goodness-of-fit (GoF), which is the geometric mean of the average communality (outer measurement model) and the average R 2 of endogenous latent variables, is used to assess the overall fit of a model. The GoF validates a PLS model by presenting a compromise between the performance of the measurement and the structural model; it is normalised between 0 and 1, where a high value indicates better path model estimation. The q 2 statistic measures the predictive relevance of the model. A q 2 greater than 0 indicates that a model has predictive relevance, and values less than 0 indicate a lack of predictive relevance. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents the b, R 2 , GoF, t-values, f 2 , and q 2 for the research model. The results obtained in this study indicate that the research model is structurally sound, as it possesses adequate predictive relevance and performance.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> show the structural model's results. Three out of the four hypotheses relating SBT's constructs to attitude towards compliance were supported, the exception being Hypothesis 1.  Half of the hypotheses relating SBT's constructs to subjective norms were supported; namely, H6 and H7 were unconfirmed. Obviously, the formulated hypotheses were largely supported by the results. Contrary to the stated prediction, the data did not support H1, i.e., the impact of attachment on attitude towards compliance (b = À0.43, t-value = 3.601). The obtained result is statistically significant at the p &lt; 0.01 level; however, it cannot be accepted due to its negative direction. Nevertheless, this result appears to suggest that it is possible for an employee to have a positive attitude about his or her organisation's ISSP yet hold differing perceptions from coworkers. According to Casper and Harris <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, perceived individual benefits and self-interest are some of the possible causes of such discord.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path</head><p>It is somewhat surprising that H6 (Commitment will have a positive effect on Subjective norms) and H7 (Involvement will have a positive effect on Subjective norms) were unsupported. It is difficult to make sense of these findings; however, a plausible explanation for these results might involve the scale composition, research sample, or other extraneous influences. For instance, a perceived lack of involvement and/or rift between IS professionals and business managers vis-a `-vis organisational IS issues has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>H2-H4 were supported, indicating that Commitment, Involvement, and Personal norms have positive effects on Attitude towards compliance with ISSP. These three factors, together with Attachment and Subjective norms, jointly explained 46% of the variance in Attitude towards compliance. These results are consistent with postulations in SBT indicating that socially involved and committed individuals with appropriate personal values who benefit from the influence of significant others will develop acceptable attitudes that will ultimately shape their attitudes towards a behaviour, in this instance ISSP compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>Support for H5 confirmed that employees tend to be more bonded with colleagues' views of their organisation's ISSP when they are strongly attached to their organisational objectives in such matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Similarly, our data analysis confirmed H8, suggesting that Personal norms are positively related to Subjective norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. The four SBT's constructs explained 22% of the variance in Subjective norms. Support for H9 was also provided, affirming the prediction indicating that employees' Attitude towards compliance would strongly benefit from the influence of significant others <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. H10, which predicted that Attitude towards compliance with ISSPs would have a positive effect on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions, was confirmed. Attitude towards compliance has the largest effect size on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions. This finding is consistent with the results of other studies based on the TPB <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. The hypothesised, positive impact of Subjective norms on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions (H11) was also supported by the data. This result is in agreement with the findings of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. H12 was confirmed, supporting the notion that an individual's locus of control is crucial in encouraging ISSP compliance behavioural intentions. Moreover, the data analysis supported H13, which predicted that individual's self-efficacy would have a positive effect on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions. The findings regarding the pertinence of both the individual's locus of control and self-efficacy in the research model are consistent with the tenets of both SCT and TPB and mirror results from comparable studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>.</p><p>All the study's variables explain 61% of the variance in the dependent construct.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Research contributions and implications</head><p>This study offers several contributions to the IS security management literature. To the best of our knowledge, it is among the first studies to integrate the theory of planned behaviourwhich encompasses social cognitive theory -with social bond theory for use in IS security discourse. This integrative conceptualisation offers a new perspective in understanding employees' ISSP compliance behavioural intentions, which we believe supplements research based on other, widely publicised theoretical lenses, such as deterrence theory and protection motivation theory. Furthermore, this research supports the postulations in SBT, SCT, and the TPB in so far as perceptions of social norms, group influence, and cognitive abilities can serve to discourage or curtail unacceptable behaviours with respect to ISSP compliance.</p><p>The suitability of the TPB -either the overarching theory or its extensions -for IS security behaviours is strongly supported by our data. In fact, a quick scan of the literature shows that studies using some of the other theoretical perspectives have found that the variance explained (R 2 ) by the antecedents of ISSP compliance is about 40%. For example, Vance et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, Son <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and Herath and Rao <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> reported R 2 values of 0.44, 0.42, and 0.42, respectively. On the other hand, studies based on the TPB tend to have higher explanatory power; please see, for example, Hazari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Lee and Kozar <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and this current effort, with R 2 values of 0.58, 0.55, and 0.61, respectively. It is safe to suggest that the understanding of ISSP compliance may be deepened by integrating the TPB with other perspectives.</p><p>It does not appear that a worker's decision to comply with his or her organisation's ISSP largely depends on perceived sanctions and penalties <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. To a lesser degree, the data analysis of this current research seems to lend credence to an emerging viewpoint in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>, showing that the use of deterrence theory as an overriding means by which employee's ISSP compliance/ noncompliance can be explicated may require further re-examination. It is safe to suggest that this study complements previous findings by integrating social components as factors influencing employees' intention to comply with ISSP. Social factors have not been considered in studies based on deterrence theory.</p><p>This study furthers our understanding of ISSP compliance by demonstrating the pertinence of the effects of socialisation, influence and cognition on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions. We argued and found support for the hypothesis suggesting that employees form social bonds at work and that they may use significant others as role models for analysing the appropriateness of particular beliefs and behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Such bonds influence their attitude towards compliance, which augurs well for behavioural compliance, in this instance for ISSP compliance. We confirmed that when an employee has perceives to have control over issues affecting them or others in their workplace, they may readily assume responsibility for their actions, i.e., ISSP compliance. In addition, with adequate capabilities and competence to cope with IS security issues, an employee will make a choice to comply with his or her organisation's ISSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. The IS security management literature is augmented by such findings.</p><p>By including the views of both IS professionals and non-IS managers, this research broadens knowledge regarding IS security behaviours in organisations from the viewpoint of both cohorts.</p><p>Such considerations are necessary for enhancing insight into ISSP compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. This study provides a testable research conceptualisation that other studies can further develop. One possible area of interest might be to use the constructs in this study and other perspectives in the extant literature to develop a comprehensive, integrative contingency model for assessing ISSP compliance in organisations. An extension to this current effort could investigate the effects of organisational citizenship behaviours (OCB) and social and organisational learning perspectives on ISSP compliance. Additionally, given that Personal norms were found to be the most influential bonding element on Attitude towards compliance and Subjective norms, future research could examine how Personal norms vis-a `-vis IS security issues in the workplace could be further enhanced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Implications for practice</head><p>This study suggests that management can increase ISSP compliance by providing an environment where individuals can learn organisational values and the importance of their organisation's ISSP through co-worker socialisation. Organisation-wide relationships focusing on inter-and intra-unit levels with respect to ISSP issues may serve to encourage group conformity with organisational IS rules and requirements. Put differently, individuals are more likely to buy in to their organisation's ISSP when they know that complying with the ISSP is a social issue that benefits their colleagues and others in the organisation. By the same token, influential people in organisations who are capable of motivating or shaping the opinions of others could be tasked to champion the cause of ISSP compliance. Overall, individual attitudes towards ISSP compliance are positively enhanced by such input.</p><p>In the context of this research, the results showing a lack of support for the impact of Attachment, Commitment and Involvement on Attitude towards compliance and Subjective norms raise an interesting question. Perhaps ensuring that all employees sing from the same hymn book with respect to organisational IS security is the best way forward; however, such may be difficult to achieve due to individual self-interests. Nevertheless, whenever possible, management should promote and encourage organisational bonding with respect to IS security concerns. Regular group meetings on such matters may be one means of doing so. Complete adherence to social norms and values in any organisation requires an extensive socialisation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>; where such socialisation is achieved, favourable outcomes regarding ISSP compliance may ensue <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p><p>As the bonding element of Personal norms has the most significant impact on Attitude towards compliance and Subjective norms, management should ensure that employees with negative personal beliefs about IS security issues are provided greater education and awareness regarding such matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and proactive efforts should be made to socialise or 'bond' lagging individuals with peers who are already familiar with the organisation's values and objectives. Indeed, workers learn important values and cues from coworkers and superiors <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. In addition, rewards and incentives aimed at improving personal beliefs about IS security issues could be used.</p><p>Given the significant effects of Attitude towards compliance, Locus of control, and Self-efficacy on ISSP compliance behavioural intentions, management may consider adopting the following strategies: (1) Management could strive to provide regular inhouse IS security awareness sessions, campaigns and training to positively shape the normative beliefs and, eventually, the attitudes of their workers regarding IS security issues and concerns. Those lacking proper attitudes related to their organisation's ISSP and related guidelines could benefit from such regular orientation and education. (2) IS security procedures, practices, and directives should not be intimidating and cumbersome, so as to not discourage ordinary workers from attempting to assume responsibility for basic IS security matters. When workers perceive to have control over such issues, they tend to comply with policies related to such issues, in this instance ISSP. (3) There is a need to provide facilitating conditions, such as general exposure to emerging security technologies and relevant incentives to encourage individuals to take it upon themselves to develop or improve the necessary skills and knowledge that are required to help safeguard organisational IS assets. The availability of such encouragement in relation to skill acquisition will facilitate employees' ISSP compliance. (4) Practitioners should also pay attention to gender differences in relation to ISSP compliance in organisations. This research suggests that males appeared to have lower compliance intentions compared to their female counterparts. Targeted awareness programmes and monitoring are examples of measures that could be used to bridge apparent gaps in behaviour between genders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Limitations of the study</head><p>There are limitations to this study. Although common method bias was not a problem for this study, it is still possible that the participants provided socially desirable responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to some of the issues being investigated. Moreover, the sample is not entirely random, which might negatively affect the generalisability of the study's findings. The sample was based on 124 responses. Although the research conceptualisation and analysis met the requirements for using the PLS technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a larger sample size may provide more statistical power and performance.</p><p>The study included the views of respondents who have formal ISSPs in their organisations and those who do not. The inclusion of both types of respondents might have negatively affected the results. Nonetheless, the questionnaire that was used provided the participants with clear information about the study (please see Appendix B). Further, comparisons of the groups' responses did not show significant, statistical differences between the two groups. The data were obtained from a cross-sectional field survey; longitudinal data may provide more insight into ISSP compliance. Future research in this area may consider using qualitative approaches, including action research and focus groups, to provide further insight into ISSP compliance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>Prior research on ISSP compliance and computer security behaviours in organisations has adopted the perspectives of criminological theories and health belief theory. While such perspectives are important, we argue that the literature can benefit from other relevant theoretical underpinnings. To that end, we proposed and empirically tested a research model that drew from the influences of socialisation, group influences, personal beliefs, self-efficacy, and cognition. Our findings showed that the proposed factors indeed affect ISSP compliance in organisations. To a large degree, the study's results indicated that socio-organisational factors affect individuals' attitudes towards ISSP compliance and subjective norms, which in turn affect ISSP compliance behavioural intentions. In addition, social influence and individuals' perceptions of their control and competence with regard to IS security issues have a positive effect on ISSP compliance behaviours. By focusing on the constructs considered in this study, knowledge of ISSP compliance is augmented and diversified. a These items were deleted from further data analysis due to their low item loadings. b These items were assessed by the following parameters: Beyond my control (1) . . .Within my control <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. c These items were assessed by the following parameters: Hard (1). . .Easy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. d These items were assessed by the following parameters: Inadequate (1). . .
