Honig, Senior Member, ZEEE Abstract-We consider interference suppression for directsequence spread-spectrum code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems using the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) performance criterion. The conventional matched filter receiver suffers from the near-far problem, and requires strict power control (typically involving feedback from receiver to transmitter) for acceptable performance. Multiuser detection schemes previously proposed mitigate the near-far problem, but are complex and require explicit knowledge or estimates of the interference parameters. In this paper, we present and analyze several new MMSE interference suppression schemes, which have the advantage of being near-far resistant (to varying degrees, depending on their complexity), and can be implemented adaptively when interference parameters are unknown and/or time-varying. Numerical results are provided that show that these schemes offer significant performance gains relative to the matched filter receiver. We conclude that MMSE detectors can alleviate the need for stringent power control in CDMA systems, and may be a practical alternative to the matched filter receiver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>EMODULATION of direct-sequence spread-spectrum D (DS/SS) code-division multiple-access (CDMA) signals is conventionally achieved with a matched filter receiver. Because the crosscorrelations between the spreading, or signature, sequences for different transmissions are nonzero, a nearby interferer can disrupt reception of a highly attenuated desired signal. Interference suppression schemes previously proposed [5], [8]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> can mitigate this near-fur problem by exploiting the structure of the multiple-access interference. These schemes are significantly more complex than the matched filter receiver and require explicit knowledge or estimates of interference parameters. Consequently, recent proposals for CDMA systems (e.g., see 141) assume a matched filter receiver, and solve the near-far problem by using power control, which requires feedback from the receiver to the transmitter.</p><p>In this paper we propose and analyze several interference suppression schemes based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. This work, originally presented in [lo]- <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>, was motivated by recent work which has shown that MMSE equalization techniques can be used to suppress both intersymbol interference (ISI) and crosstalk interference in wire channels [l], <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A major advantage of MMSE schemes, relative to other previously proposed interference suppression schemes, is that explicit knowledge of interference parameters is not required, since filter parameters can be adapted to achieve the MMSE solution. Also, the complexity of these schemes, measured in number of filter coefficients, can be adjusted to achieve a given level of performance.</p><p>The MMSE linear detector for a pulse-amplitude modulated data signal in the presence of interfering data signals consists of a bank of filters matched to the pulse shapes of all active users followed by symbol-rate samplers and an Infinite-length Impulse Response (IIR) multi-input/singleoutput digital filter (see [7] and the references therein). The interference suppression schemes proposed here can be viewed as finite-complexity approximations of this detector. The first scheme proposed consists of sampling the channel output at the chip rate, and using an N-tap adaptive FIR filter to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the transmitted and detected symbol where N is the processing gain. This scheme is motivated by the fact that the MMSE linear detector just described can be implemented as an infinite-length fractionally spaced tapped-delay line. For the special case of symbol-and chip-synchronous CDMA transmissions, the N-tap detector is in fact equivalent to the MMSE linear detector. If, however, transmissions are symbol-asynchronous, then the MMSE linear detector requires an infinite number of taps. Furthermore, if transmissions are chip-asynchronous, then the MMSE linear detector requires that the tap spacing be smaller than the chip duration. However, our numerical results demonstrate that even in the chip-and symbol-asynchronous situation, the N-tap MMSE detector can offer a dramatic performance improvement relative to the matched filter detector. Finally, in the absence of multiple-access interference, the N-tap detector reduces to the conventional matched filter receiver.</p><p>The remaining interference suppression schemes proposed to a bank of D filters, each of which is a cyclically shifted version of the matched filter. In the second scheme a single matched filter is used, but its output is sampled D times per symbol interval. In each case, the decision statistic is a linear combination of the D samples obtained in a symbol interval, where the weights are selected to minimize the MSE. Since D can be much smaller than the processing gain N , these schemes should be easier to adapt than the N-tap MMSE detector when N is large. The first scheme typically performs somewhat better than the second scheme. Furthermore, the first scheme can be implemented as a bank of D filters of length N/D, which are each sampled D times per symbol interval.</p><p>This makes the complexity of the two schemes comparable.</p><p>Interference suppression techniques for CDMA systems using the MMSE criterion have also been considered in [2],</p><p>[5], <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. An adaptive correlator, which is similar to the N-tap detector is proposed in <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. However, the emphasis in [ 171 is on supressing narrowband interference, rather than other wideband CDMA signals.The detector proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> uses an MMSE criterion to estimate a finite block of transmitted symbols. The front end of this detector consists of a bank of filters matched to the pulse shapes of all active users followed by symbol-rate samplers. Explicit knowledge or estimates of the interference parameters are therefore assumed. Also, the estimated symbols are obtained by processing all matched filter outputs which correspond to the entire block of transmitted symbols. In contrast, the detectors presented here process samples from within a single symbol interval to estimate the desired symbol, and require significantly less computation.</p><p>The MMSE decision feedback equalizer (DFE) in the context of CDMA is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Since only decisions from the desired user are fed back, the feedback filter suppresses intersymbol interference, but not multiple-access interference. Since we focus on the latter in the present paper, we restrict attention to linear MMSE detectors of varying complexity. A multiuser decision-feedback detector, in which decisions on transmitted symbols from all users are fed back, is considered in [5]. Although the feedback filter in this case does suppress multi-user interference, this structure is more complex than the detectors considered in this paper, and is more difficult to adapt in the presence of unknown interferers.</p><p>As the level of background noise tends to zero, or as the energies of the interferers increases to infinity, the MMSE linear detector converges to the decorrelating detector introduced in [8]-191, which eliminates multiple access interference at the expense of noise enhancement. Because the schemes considered here are finite complexity approximations of the MMSE linear detector, their performance is, in general, not as good as the performance of the decorrelating detector (which has the same complexity as that of the MMSE linear detector) <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>. Nevertheless, the results in Sections I11 and V demonstrate that the schemes considered here are generally near-far resistant, in the sense defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The next section presents the CDMA system model considered, and the performance of the MMSE detectors presented in this paper is analyzed in Section 111. Section IV presents the two simpler interference suppression schemes. Numerical results are presented and discussed in Section V, and Section VI contains our conclusions.</p></div>

For convenience we also consider a carrier-synchronous system in which the carrier phase B j = 0 for each j , although our analysis is easily modified to take nonzero Oj into account. For 2 5 j 5 K , the relative delay vj = (rj + Sj)Tc where rj is an integer between 0 and N -1, and Sj = vj/T,rj lies in the interval [0, 1). An asynchronous system is assumed in which both rj and Sj may be nonzero. Each detection scheme presented here estimates a given transmitted symbol from received samples within a single symbol period. The estimate of bo, 1 therefore depends only on the received signal for t E [0, TI, or equivalently, the vector of received samples rT = (r[O], . . . , T[N -11). During this symbol interval the jth interfering signature sequence is kTc +vi modulated by symbol bo,j for vj &lt; t 5 T , and by symbol b -i , j for 0 &lt; t 5 u j .

The Ndimensional noise vector n is Gaussian with mean zero and covariance matrix a 2 1 ~ where I N denotes the N x N identity matrix, and a2 = N0/2.</p><p>Note that 00, j and 0 -1 , j are linearly independent and are modulated by different bits, so that the jth asynchronous interferer effectively contributes two interference vectors during a single symbol interval. We can therefore analyze the asynchronous system considered as a synchronous system with additional interferers. where r E R M , the vector p 1 is the desired signal vector, b j , 2 5 j 5 L, are symbols contributed by interferers, and { p j } , j = 2, . . . , L, is the set of interference vectors. We will assume that bj E {-1, 1}, that the transmitted symbols are independent and have zero mean, and that the noise vector n is Gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix I?.</p><p>Comparing ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and (6), it is clear that (6) applies to the asynchronous CDMA system considered in the last section where the dimension M is the processing gain N, r = g 2 1 ~, the desired bit bl = bo, 1, the desired vector p 1 = al, and the set of interference vectors is {flu,,,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">j , f l u -1 , j } , j = 2, . . . , K.

For the N-tap MMSE detector, r in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) are the same. Note that the matched filter detector corresponds to setting c = al. For the other detection schemes described in Section IV, the vectors p j in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) are different from the analogous vectors in (5), and the dimension M is less than the processing gain N.</p><p>In addition to MSE, two other performance measures of interest are signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and error probability. The SIR is defined to be the ratio of the desired signal power to the sum of the powers due to noise and multipleaccess interference at the output of the filter c. That is, It can be shown that the MMSE solution also maximizes the SIR. This maximum value is denoted by MSIR.</p><p>Since all users transmit binary, equiprobable, antipodal symbols, we may condition on bl ,= 1 for the purpose of evaluating the error probability P(b1 # b l ) .

(<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>If L -1, the number of interference vectors, is less than M, the dimension of the signal vectors, and the noise is zero (small), then the matrix A is singular (ill-conditioned). This situation is likely to apply to the N-tap detector, since M = N is generally selected to be larger than L-1 5 2(K -1). In this case the following geometric derivation of the MMSE solution can be used to evaluate performance. If A is ill-conditioned, then there are different solutions for c which result in nearly the same MSE. This can result in tap wandering during adaptation, which has been observed in single-user applications by Gitlin et al. [6]. One solution to this problem, which slightly increases the MSE, is the tap leakage algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Alternative Derivation Using Orthogonal Decompositions</head><p>In what follows it will be convenient to assume that the noise is white, i.e., that r = a 2 1 M . This assumption does not entail any loss of generality since the noise n can always be whitened by an orthonormal linear transformation V where any vector w orthogonal to this space satisfies wTr = vTn, and therefore only contributes noise to the output. Furthermore, the space S is the direct sum of the orthogonal subspaces SI and the subspace spanned by 0:. so that the MMSE solution can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">c = CI + dlo: (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where we have used the fact that cTpj = (c')'pj for 2 5 j 5</p><p>L.

Asymptotic Behavior of the MMSE Solution</head><p>The quantities in (18)-( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) will be specified in terms of the crosscorrelations of the signal vectors p1 , . . . , p L ; however, before doing this we consider the limiting behavior of the MMSE solution as 1) the noise level goes to zero, and 2) the interference vectors increase in energy. First consider the zeronoise situation in which a' = 0. If 0: # 0, then clearly the interference can be eliminated by choosing c to be a multiple of 0:. This choice of c is called the zero-forcing solution.</p><p>If a' = 0, then the zero-forcing solution gives zero MSE, as indicated by (18). In this case, the MMSE solution is therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(20)</formula><p>where the scaling is determined by the requirement lcTrl = Now consider the near-far situation, in which the energy of one or more of the interference vectors can vary arbitrarily. Define wj = (Ipj112 as the energy of the jth signal vector where 1 5 j 5 L. For a given w1, we are interested in the MMSE solution c when the interference energies wz, . . . , W L assume values that maximize the MMSE. It is easily verified that the MMSE increases monotonically as a function of the interference energies so that we consider the asymptotic MMSE solution as wj -+ 03 for j E J,, for some subset J , ( 2 , . . . , L}. In addition, we assume that wj, j $ ! Jm, are constant. In contrast to the worst case MMSE performance considered here, we note that for the maximum-likelihood detector, the interference energies that maximize error probability are not easily determined [141.</p><p>It is shown in Appendix B that the MMSE solution satisfies 0:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">I 1 0 : I I c = - lcTplI = lbll = 1. lim cTpj = 0, j E J, . w, -io3</formula><p>That is, c is asymptotically orthogonal to the space spanned by the set of interference vectors { p j } , j E J, . In the worst-case situation in which these vectors span the entire interference subspace S I , we have that c ' = 0 asymptotically, and we where c' is the projection of c onto S I , and dl is a scalar. and is a limiting measure, as the noise level tends to zero, of how well the detector performs in the presence of multipleaccess interference relative to its performance in the absence of multiple-access interference.

Since this quantity is independent of the energies of the interference vectors, we have that The near-far resistance of the MMSE detectors considered is therefore the (appropriately normalized) norm of the component of the desired signal vector which is orthogonal to the space spanned by the interference vectors.</p><p>The near-far resistance is nonzero if and only if the desired vector p1 is not contained in the interference subspace S I . A necessary condition for this is to be true is that the dimension of SI be strictly less than the dimension of the signal vectors M . Since the dimension of SI is upper bounded by L -1, the number of interference vectors, it is reasonable to expect nonzero near-far resistance when L -1 5 M -1. We emphasize that this is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for nonzero near-far resistance, but is merely an approximate rule. Applying this rule to the N-tap MMSE detector, the signal vector dimension M = N , so that this detector has enough degrees of freedom to suppress ( N - 1)/2 asynchronous interferers. (Recall that each asynchronous interferer can generate at most two interference vectors, so that L -1 5 2(K -1)). In contrast, for synchronous CDMA, the N-tap detector has enough degrees of freedom to suppress at most N -1 interferers, since each interferer generates only one interference vector (L -1 = K -1).</p></div>

For a typical set of user signature sequences (e.g., PN sequences), the resulting filter vectors are independent (in fact, nearly orthogonal).</p><p>The cyclically shifted filter bank (CSFB) scheme is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. The filter outputs are sampled at the symbol rate and are combined by means of D taps. Referring to the description of the CDMA system in Section 11, the filters f, E RN, i = 0 , .. . , D -1, are cyclic shifts of the signature sequence a l , i.e., from the formulas in Section I11 by making the appropriate substitutions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">[ f J k = a1 [(IC + i A ) " I N ] , 0 5 IC 5 N -1, 0 5 i 5 D -</formula><p>We now show that the vector y can be generated with D filters each of length N / D , assuming that D divides N, so that the total number of taps in the filter bank is N , instead of ND.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Over-Sampling</head><p>The CSFB scheme is similar (but not equivalent) to sampling the output of the single matched filter f a = 01 D times per symbol period. Over-sampling the output of the matched filter in this context is analogous to the fractionally spaced equalizer for single-user channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Denote the matched filter output at time N -1 -ZA as In general, m can also be selected to minimize the MSE; however, the numerical results in the next section assume that m = [(Dl)/2J. It is shown in Appendix E that the vector w can be expressed as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where p l , . . . , p L are chosen appropriately. The performance of this scheme can therefore be evaluated by using the formulas in Section 111.</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">N -1 v, = a1 [k]r[k -iA] (<label>45</label></formula><p>From (45) it is apparent that samples r[k] for k = -(Dm -! ) A , . -. , N -1 + m A are used to compute the estimate bo, 1 . As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, depending on the relative delay rJ, the jth interfering signal during this interval may contain segments from three different symbol intervals. The bits associated with these different segments are bo, 3 , b-1, 3 , and either b-2, or b l , J . This is in contrast to the CSFB and N-tap MMSE schemes, in which the jth interfering signal contributes segments from at most two successive symbol intervals with associated bits and b -l , J . Also, for the over-sampling scheme adjacent symbol intervals of the desired transmission, associated with bits b-1,1 and bl, 1, act as additional interference, which is not present in the CSFB scheme. For the same value of D the performance of the over-sampling scheme is therefore expected to be, on average, somewhat worse than that of the CSFB scheme. According to the approximate rule stated at the end of Section 111-B, since each asynchronous interferer can effectively contribute three interference vectors, the over-sampling scheme should perform significantly better than the matched filter detector when the number of strong asynchronous interferers is less than or equal to (D -1)/3.</p><p>Both the over-sampling and CSFB schemes require D filter taps. However, the CSFB scheme requires D samplers (as compared to one for the over-sampling scheme), together with D connections between sampled outputs as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(b</ref>). The increase in complexity required by the CSFB scheme relative to the over-sampling scheme seems quite modest so that the CSFB scheme may be preferable in many situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>We now compare numerically the performance of the interference suppression schemes discussed in preceding section with the matched filter receiver for a specific example. All of the following results assume that the processing gain N = 31, and that the interferers are asynchronous, but have the same signature sequence, which is different from the desired signature sequence. Both the desired and interference signature sequences are Gold sequences taken from [3, Table <ref type="table">VI</ref>. The corresponding interference vectors are linearly independent, due to the different delays of the interferers, and the fact that distinct shifts of a PN sequence are linearly independent. The delays of the interferers relative to the desired signal, as multiples of the chip interval T,, are denoted by vg, . . . . v ~.</p><p>In order to reduce the computation required to average over all delays, we impose the relation v3 = vg + ( j -2)X (modulo N) for 3 5 j 5 K , for fixed A, which fixes the delay between user j , j &gt; 3, and user 2. The following examples are averaged over v2.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows a plot of near-far resistance, as defined in Section 111 versus the delay vg for the N-tap, CSFB, and oversampling schemes. (The near-far resistance of the matched filter is zero.) The parameters are K = 3 users, X = 5.5, and D = 7 for the CSFB and over-sampling schemes. According to the discussion in Section IV, the minimum number of taps for which the near-far resistance can be expected to be positive is D = 5 for the CSFB scheme and D = 7 for the over-sampling scheme. In fact, for D = 5 (not shown here), and for nearly all delays u2, the over-sampling scheme does have zero near-far resistance, and the near-far resistance of the CSFB scheme is quite small. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows that the near-far resistance of each of the simpler schemes is very sensitive to delay, and can be quite small. In contrast, the near-far resistance of the N-tap MMSE detector is much less sensitive to delay, and stays relatively high. It is interesting that there are several delays at which the over-sampling scheme has greater near-far resistance than the CSFB scheme. However, the succeeding sets of numerical results, which are averaged over delays, show that the CSFB scheme offers a modest performance improvement relative to the over-sampling scheme.</p><p>We now consider the situation in which S (strong) interferers each have power P , assumed to be large, relative to the desired user, and the remaining K -1 -S interferers have the same power as the desired user. Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref> show SIR and average error probability, respectively, as a function of P, which varies from 0 to 10 dB, relative to the desired user. The performance measures are averaged over the relative delay vz (quantized to multiples of T,/4). The signal-to-noise ratio for the desired user in the absence of multiple-access interference is fixed at 20 dB. The curves for the CSFB scheme, over-sampling scheme, and matched filter receiver assume that K = 6 and S = 2, whereas the curves for the N-tap MMSE detector assume that K = 11 and S = 10. That is, for the simpler schemes there are five interferers, two of which are strong, and for the N-tap MMSE detector there are 10 interferers, all of which are strong.</p><p>Ignoring the potential problem of slow adaptation speed, Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref> show that the N-tap MMSE detector essentially eliminates the need for power control. Despite their relative simplicity, the CSFB and over-sampling schemes perform substantially better than the matched filter receiver, and would likely loosen the requirements for power control in this context. These results also show that for the same D the CSFB scheme performs somewhat better than the over-sampling scheme. We add that the degradation in the performance of the MMSE schemes with respect to single-user performance</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have presented three MMSE interference suppression schemes, which offer a significant performance improvement relative to the matched filter receiver. The N-tap MMSE detector seems appropriate when the processing gain N is relatively small, which corresponds to relatively few simultaneous transmissions. The CSFB and over-sampling schemes seem appropriate when N is relatively large, and there are relatively few strong interferers (because of power control). These detectors are significantly less complex than linear multiuser detectors previously proposed, such as the decorrelating detector [8]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which in principle requires infinite memory. Of course, the MMSE schemes proposed here are easily modified so that the adaptive filter spans more than one symbol interval. This may be desirable if the adaptive filter is to suppress multi-path, as well as multiple-access, interference.</p><p>A major advantage MMSE interference suppression schemes have over previously proposed multiuser detection schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, [8]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is that the MMSE performance criterion allows filter parameters to be adapted in a straightforward manner without a priori knowledge of the interference parameters. An important question is whether or not standard adaptive algorithms are able to track time-varying interference in a wireless environment. In addition to interference from other users, fading, multipath, and narrowband interference [12] must also be considered. Finally, the use of MMSE schemes to suppress both multiple-access interference and intersymbol interference in the context of CDMA with a finite bandwidth constraint is currently being studied.</p></div>
