<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Tremendous academic information causes serious information overload problems while supporting scientific research. Scientific paper and citation recommendation systems have been developed to relieve this problem and work as a filter to furnish only relevant papers to researchers. Although previous studies have made comparative progress, this problem is still challenging because current paper recommendation systems rely on heterogeneous and multi-sourced features, thereby requiring a unified learning representation to cover different types and modalities of information. Additionally, the implicit influence of scholars' previous preferences of writing and citing on his/her new manuscript has not been well considered in the previous studies. Facing the issue from these two aspects, in this paper, a heterogeneous knowledge embedding-based attentive RNN model is proposed to recommend scientific paper citations. First, the preparation of features consists of two parts: (1) building a unified learning representation of structural entities and relations for recommending paper citations; and (2) defining and constructing a bibliographic network comprising five types of entities and five relations. The bibliographic network enables learning a unified representation so that all graphical entities and relations can be vectorized using TransD. To establish textual representations, the PV-DM model is utilized to generate numeric features for the title of each paper. Second, by combining structural and textual representations focusing on the ''author-text query" scenario, an attentive bidirectional RNN is constructed to recommend paper and citation based on an user's identity with a length-limited inquiry to capture the scholars' previous writing and citing preferences, thereby reducing recommendation error. Through the DBLP dataset, our experiment results show the feasibility and effectiveness of our method, both in terms of the number as well as the quality of the first few recommended items. In specific, compared with existing models, our model has improved MRR and NDCG by approximately 4.8% and 2.4%, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Recommendation methods help users in deal with the information overload problem. In the academic as well as the educational domain, the application of intelligent recommending technologies enhances the utilization efficiency of academic resources to a great extent, especially for newcomers and students in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In addition, as one of the important carriers of academics and scientific knowledge, scientific papers are experiencing a new era named ''big scholarly data'': the number of published paper has sharply increased year after year, involving more participants and wider vocations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Therefore, recommending scientific papers to busy researchers and research students may reduce the impact caused by information overload in terms of the huge volume of academic data, and could facilitate more efficient research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> and provide better decision support to evaluate researching outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</p><p>Existing recommendation methods demonstrate the feasibility of using different kinds of attributes and relationships from scientific papers as the basis for the recommendation, such as historical behavior and records, research content, citation network, etc. Accordingly, previous researches on recommendation systems for scientific papers are categorized into four approaches: collaborative filtering (CF), content based filtering (CBF), graph-based (GB) and a fusion of multiple approaches (Hybrid) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. However, in the real-world situation where data on these scientific papers are multi-modal and multi-sourced <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, when a recommending strategy is employed, determining the weights of each information source and establishing a unified data representation standard becomes a new problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, deep learning-based embedding representation provides a new perspective on unifying heterogeneous features as well as an opportunity for exploiting a powerful deep recommending model to establish more accurate recommendation by considering wider and deeper underlying features including semantic, preferred and academic relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. For instance, the entities and relations that involving research literature, such as the co-affiliation, co-venue, co-author, co-citation, etc., could be jointly characterized to help representing key entities including authors and papers. In addition, the introduction of the attention mechanism has shown an outstanding utility to address challenging implicit feedback in recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In this scenario, the attentive network could automatically select important signals from the aforementioned representations, thereby catching the implicit behavior information between a scholar's references history and publication history. In addition to a user's previous sequence of published and cited papers, using an attentive neural network to establish a personalized recommendation based on an unified knowledge representation of papers, scholars and other entities is promising.</p><p>In light of the aspects, this paper proposes a paper citation recommendation method based on establishing an attentive recurrent neural networks (RNN). To be specific, first, we construct a bibliographic network to describe each entity and relation existing on the research paper network including paper, author, venue, publication year, affiliation as entities and citations, authorship, place of employment, release date and publisher as relations. Then, we utilize different approaches to derive the vectorial representation of different data based on their own modality. In the recommendation stage, we take a hypothesis that A scholar user's previous research and current new research are often related. Therefore, we further assume a scholar user's past writing preferences and citation preferences help to improve the accuracy of recommendations of new papers. On the basis of these vectorial representation as features, we establish our attentive RNN-based recommendation model with a scenario in which users can obtain recommendations by providing only a lengthlimited inquiry as well as their identity. Finally, based on the experimental results, we further explore on our model to evaluate its effectiveness and the impact of the components utilized in our model. This proposed method enables entities and relationships of different types and modalities to be modeled in a unified graph, and finally a unified representation based on this heterogeneous graph can be constructed, thereby utilizing as many features as possible. Meanwhile, the use of the attentive RNN network makes full use of the user's past citation and publishing behavior, and finally integrates all the features at the graph and sequence level, overcoming the limitation that the previous methods only used homogeneous features to generate recommendations. To summarize, this study has the following contributions: (1) We first introduce the historical behavior and preferences of an author and establish a heterogeneous bibliographic network by fusing the information including authors, research papers, publish times, venues, affiliations. (2) Focusing on the ''author-query'' scenario, we propose a heterogeneous knowledge embedding based attentive recurrent neural network to establish paper recommendation. (3) By performing the experiment on the DBLP dataset, we show that the promising performance of the proposed method compared to other existing baseline models especially in short-term recommendations.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the related work section, we briefly review the existing recommendation approaches on paper citation in the current literature. In the method section, we detail our proposed citation recommendation model including the construction of the bibliographic network, heterogeneous entity embedding and the structure of our recommendation model. By using a real-world DBLP dataset, we measure the performance of the proposed model and compare it with four other baseline models in the experiment and result section. Further exploration and limitations are discussed in the discussion section. The last section gives the conclusive remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related works</head><p>The original purpose of paper and citation recommendation is to reduce the amount of time researchers spend in tediously searching for existing work, thereby relieving the problem of information overload <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. With the rapid development in this field, its purpose has taken on a much wider scope as follows: recommending reference for draft completion, guiding beginners, keeping track of the current developments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, etc. In this section, we review this representative literature according to their aforementioned class of recommendation model: CBF, CF, GB and Hybrid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Content-based filtering methods</head><p>As classic as well as one of the most widely applied recommendation approaches, the CBF method provides recommendation by discovering the association between user modeling (user profile) and textual features (item representation) in the paper. In addition, the interaction between users and the paper constitutes the major part of the process of user modeling, such as authorship <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, favorite collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, browsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, etc. For the purpose of item representation in textual features, several methods have been proposed and utilized. For example, a wellknown paper recommendation project, CiteSeer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> first uses term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to weight citations as well as words to generate numeric feature. Inspired by this idea, several TF-IDF-based word-level paper representations are proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Apart from the TF-IDF model, there are also other approaches which use bag-of-words as features, such as n-grams <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, tag-based topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. On the other hand, in order to learn the profiles of users, methods that can acquire preference based on users' historical actions. Similar to generating representations of papers, several methods are used to model users. For instance, Gautam and Kumar <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> constructed a tag-based base which consists of user preferred tags and general tags to establish the recommendation. Another example is Docear <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which uses a tree-like data structure to match a user's mind map with the types of metadata in the papers to achieve personalized recommendation. In the field of document-level textual embedding, Citeomatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is proposed as an embedding solution based on the textual metadata from papers and then a candidate is selected and the recommendation is re-ranked according to the nearest neighborhood of embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Collaborative filtering based methods</head><p>The basic idea of CF is that users who have similar preferences prefer items which are similar. Compared with CBF methods, CFbased methods are more independent in terms of content, which is more suitable to a wider range of application scenarios. In addition, CF methods not only measure the similarity between items, but also users, which provides more accurate profiling spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Kang et al. [31]</ref> used a low-rank assumption to complete a recovered rating matrix, thereby making the recommendation. However, scoring a paper is not a necessary process for other scholars in reading or citing papers, so a recommendation method based on scoring prediction is severely constrained by the cold start and sparse scoring problems in terms of the recommendation performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Therefore, the task of citation recommendation requires more implicit feedback by users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Graph-based methods</head><p>The academic literature has a natural network structure because papers can be connected via citations, co-authorship, reader-authorship, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Currently, under the advances of graph-based information retrieval and data mining technics, several GB methods have been proposed. Gori and Pucci proposed a random-walk approach to explore citation graphs and generate the ranking via their proposed PaperRank algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Pan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposed a graph-based similarity learning algorithm to generate recommendation based on a citation graph and a keywords graph. Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> proposed Chronological Citation Recommendation which assumes initial user information needs could shift while users are searching for papers in different time slices. Chakraborty et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> focused more on user queries, and their proposed system named DiSCern uses only a citation graph and the keywords associated with the articles without latent information to fit a more practical scenario. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> proposed a keyword-driven and popularity-aware paper recommendation approach based on an undirected paper citation graph. Manju et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> proposed a social network-based research paper recommendation method, that alleviates cold start problems by incorporating users' social interaction and topical relevancy in Mendeley academic social network with a random walk Ergodic Markov Chain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Hybrid and embedding based methods</head><p>Since various types of recommendations often have their own adaptation scenarios and the literature network is naturally multi-source and heterogeneous, thus, the hybrid approach can effectively combine the advantages of the aforementioned approaches. Current hybrid methods usually combine at least two types of recommendation methods. For example, Hammou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed a CF+CBF parallel algorithm to generate recommendation lists by combining the result lists from the two methods through an ordering function. Another example using the GB+CF method is QR recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, which uses a CFbased recommendation strategy while the representation of paper, venue and author are generated through a three-layered bibliometric graph. In terms of the GB+CB method, Kong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> used Word2vec and Structure2vec to construct a citation network with semantic meaning, thereby deriving a vectorized representation of papers and then used cosine similarity to implement the recommendations. Cai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> successively used a variety of embedding models to express the network of literature citations, and established citation predictions at the local, global and comprehensive levels,respectively.</p><p>In addition to the four commonly used methods reviewed, several other paper recommendation methods have been proposed. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> introduced a system named Claper based on fuzzy systems. They proved two principles, namely, classical papers have few decreasing download frequencies and a paper which cites a classical paper is likely to cite other citations of that classical paper. Based on this, their system finds classical papers and make recommendation based on these two principles.</p><p>To address the problems that arise when a published paper is too recent to have any citations, Ha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> proposed a model that first predicts the degree of user interest in citing a new paper and then predicts the degree of user interest in the newly-published paper according to the interest model. However, it should be noted that these methods cannot be easily categorized into any of the aforementioned classes, but the recommendation models are more or less associated with CBF, CF or GB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>In this section, we introduce our proposed paper recommendation model which integrates the heterogeneous data in scientific publications with a comprehensive feature space including entity metadata, citation behavior and information on the relations between entities. On this basis, we assume a basic application scenario for paper recommendation where an author can acquire recommendation suggestions by only providing the author's personal information and a simple text query (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Under this ''author-text query'' assumption, we first formally describe our objective in Section 3.1. Then, in Section 3.2, we construct a heterogeneous bibliographic network to generate a unified embedding for research papers as well as authors incorporating text based semantic information. A bidirectional RNN with an attention mechanism based paper recommendation method is proposed in Section 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Task formulation</head><p>Based on the aforementioned scenario, the task of the present study is formulated as follow: Suppose there are N u authors (i.e. scholar users) u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u Nu ∈ U. When an author u i provides a length-limited text query t u i ,j ∈ T u i , our model f is established to recommend a set of papers Pu i ,j that the author probably cite for this queried text via the authors' identity (u i ), the query text T u i ,j , previously published papers Q u i and previously cited papers C u i . In other words, the model is designed for predict papers that the author actually cited P u i ,j without the content of this paper itself:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pu i ,j = f (u i , T u i ,j , Q u i , C u i , θ)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where θ represents the parameters of the recommendation model. The objective of the model is to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">arg min θ ∑ u i ∈U ∑ t u i ,j ∈Tu i P u i ,j − Pu i ,j</formula><p>(2)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Constructing heterogeneous bibliographic network based embedding with text based semantic information</head><p>As a real-world situation, the whole life-cycle of academic publications is filled with heterogeneous data. Based on the idea of divide and conquer, these heterogeneous data can be constructed by different methods according to their different data modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. In this paper, we roughly divide these heterogeneous data into two categories: graph-based data and textual data. Using different modality-oriented embedding methods, the concatenation of the embedding results finally represents an entity's embedding. In short, we use different methods to process the heterogeneous data separately due to the differences in their data structures. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Construction of bibliographic network</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the proposed paper citation network consists of five layers (i.e. five kinds of entities) namely the research papers, venues, year, authors and affiliations (further details are described in Section 4.1). The paper is the core entity which is information-rich and obtaining it from several scientific indexing databases is feasible. From each scientific research paper's metadata, other entities are able to be further extracted and matched with existing entities in the bibliographic network, thereby enlarging and completing the whole network. The relation between entities can also be categorized into five types: authors write research papers; authors work or serve in different affiliations; papers are published in different venues; and papers are published in different years. Further details and the quantitative descriptions are presented in Section 4.1. However, there are several other relations which can be derived from these five kinds of relations (e.g. author-author or co-author relationship, affiliation-affiliation or cooperation relationship, etc.) existing in this bibliographic network. For the purpose of reducing computational cost, we have not implemented these relationships in the network which can be constructed through a few steps.</p><p>After the construction of the bibliographic network, the numeric representation of each entity and relation can be generated via network embedding methods. Inspired by the current development of the knowledge graph, we select the TransD <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> method to vectorize the entities and relationships stored in a graph structure. TransD not only considers the diversity of relationships, but also the diversity of entities. Additionally, TransD has fewer parameters, and there is no matrix-vector multiplication operation, which is more suitable for large graph data. TransD uses two vectors for each entity and relation to respectively represent the meaning of an entity or a relation and a way that how to project a entity embedding into a relation vector space.</p><p>In other words, by using TransD, each named symbol object (entities and relations) is represented by two vectors. The first captures the meaning of entity (relation), the other is used to construct the mapping matrices. Assume there is a relation r ∈ R (relation set) between entity h, t ∈ E (entity set), h, t and r are uniformly used to represent the vectorization embedding results of h (head node), t (tail node) and r (relationship) respectively. Given a triplet (h, r, t), its vectors can be denoted by h, h p , t, t p ∈ R n and r, r p ∈ R m , where suffix p means the projection vectors. Therefore, the mapping matrices M rh and M rt ∈ R m×n are defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M rh = r p h ⊤ p + I m×n</formula><p>(3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">M rt = r p t ⊤ p + I m×n (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where I m×n represents the identity matrix. Based on this, the mapping of the entities is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h ⊥ = M rh h (5) t ⊥ = M rh t (6)</formula><p>We use the score function to measure the performance through Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f r (h, t) = ∥h ⊥ + r − t ⊥ ∥ 2 2 (7)</formula><p>By giving the constraints that ∥h∥</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">2 ≤ 1, ∥t∥ 2 ≤ 1, ∥r∥ 2 ≤ 1, ∥h ⊥ ∥ 2 ≤ 1, ∥t ⊥ ∥ 2 ≤ 1,</formula><p>we minimize the loss function formulated in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">8</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L = ∑ (h,r,t)∈S ∑ (h ′ ,r ′ ,t ′ )∈S ′ (h,r,t) [ γ + f r (h, t) − f r ′ (h ′ , t ′ ) ] +<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where [x] + represents the absolute value of x, γ refers to the hyperparameter of the edge distance and its value is set to greater than 0, the set of triples is in the knowledge graph (i.e. golden standard) and is denoted as (h, r, t) ∈ S, and S ′ (h,r,t) represents the negatively sampled triples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Textual feature embedding</head><p>Text data is a major component of research papers, which includes title, abstracts, keywords, main text, etc. However, in relation to another aspect, experience and previous research have shown that practical situations usually require a query-oriented use case, that is, a user only provides a length-limited inquiry text for recommendation and user's identity for personalized customization <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Under these requirements, the text feature used for the recommendation inputs has to be compressed to be as short as possible while retaining as much as semantic information as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>In general, abstracts, keywords, and the title in a research article work are the summary of the full text and usually this information can be obtained from a literature retrieval/indexing system. By applying the requirements to limit the length of the inquiry text and considering the problems that not all types of scientific publications provide abstracts (e.g. scientific magazines), in our proposed method, we select the title of the paper as the textual feature in paper citation recommendation. In this subsection, we investigate and introduce a distributed memory model named the distributed memory version of paragraph vector (PV-DM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> to vectorize the title text into a numeric space.</p><p>Based on the idea of word2vec, PV-DM predicts the probability of the next word in a document through the average or concatenation of paragraph vector and word vectors. For each document, every paragraph is mapped with a specific vector, which is represented by a column in matrix D and each word is also mapped with a unique vector which is represented by a column in matrix W . Specifically, assume that there are n paragraphs in the entire corpus and m words in the whole vocabulary set, and each paragraph is mapped into a p dimensions space and each word is mapped to q dimensions, then the model has as least n × p + m × q parameters which can be trained (because there are more parameters like the parameters in the softmax function). In other words, by giving an order of words w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , . . . , w u and a paragraph d j , the object of the model is to maximize the average log probability of S:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">S = 1 t t−k ∑ i=k logp(w i |w i−1 , . . . , w i+k , d j ) (9)</formula><p>When a new document arrives, its corresponding vector can predicted via a multi-class classifier. In this paper, we select softmax to perform the prediction task:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p(w i |w i−1 , . . . , w i+k , d j ) = e yw i</formula><p>∑ j e y j <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where each y j is an unnormalized log-probability for each output word, which can be computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">y j = U • h(w i−1 , . . . , w i+k , d j ; W , D) + b (11)</formula><p>where U and b denote the softmax parameters. h is constructed by concatenating or averaging the word vectors extracted from W and the paragraph vector extracted from D.</p><p>In this paper, we choose the title as the text feature for two reasons. From the data point of view, there are currently a large number of documents missing abstracts and keywords in the current public paper datasets; from the perspective of model design, the abstracts of papers are often difficult to capture core semantics due to differences in the author's writing level and style. Keywords can only provide the semantics of words, and cannot make a complete summary of the full text. Correspondingly, the advantage of using titles is that each article in a dataset of all papers must have a title, and the length of the heading is relatively stable, which is the most refined summary of the full text. Furthermore, we believe that the title that is inconsistent with historical behavior is an important factor in improving the accuracy of recommendations. When relying only on historical records, the model usually tends to recommend papers that are similar or related to these behaviors; and when a novel title is used as additional input, it often means that the author may be changing his research direction, and recommending papers which is similar to title can help improve the recall rate of recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Attentive bidirectional RNN for recommending paper citations on ''author-text query'' scenario</head><p>As previously discussed, there are often relatively strict limitations in terms of the inquiry text when recommending paper citations. Therefore, in this subsection, we establish our recommendation model with a precondition that the input of the method can only use a limited-length inquiry alone with the author's personal information previously stored in the knowledge base. In this recommendation stage, we also take a hypothesis that A scholar user's previous research and current new research are often related, which we employ a scholar user's past writing preferences and citation preferences as features to help to improve the accuracy of recommendations of new papers.</p><p>By utilizing the aforementioned embedding method, all feature objects including entities, relations and text are transformed into vectors. The general structure of our proposed recommendation model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Three input layers are established to enrich the feature space for the model under the constraint of the ''author-text query'' scenario: Input #1 layer consists of all the embedded vectors of paper entities which have been published by the same author; Input #2 layer is similar to Input #1 which is filled with embedded vectors of paper entities which have been cited by the same author. The order of the sequence in Input #1 is determined by the publication date, and the order in Input #2 is firstly determined by the sequence of Input #1 (i.e. all the papers cited in one paper appear behind all the papers cited in another earlier paper), then by the publication dates of these cited papers (i.e. of all the papers cited in a paper, these papers are arranged in the order of publication date.). Input #3 layers consist of three types of data. The first is the set of candidate paper embedding, where the size is not only significantly larger than the total number of citations of a document, but also significantly smaller than the number of documents in the dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In this paper the candidate papers consist of positive samples and negative samples. The positive samples are collected from author real cited papers while the negative samples are randomly selected from the same journal from the positive samples. The second and the third types the embedded features of the author and the vectorized representation of the inquiry.</p><p>From a bottom-up view, the model can by roughly divided into encoder and decoder phases. During the two phases, bidirectional GRU <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> is utilized as the basic unit of RNN for the implementation. Different from LSTM, the activation of the GRU is a linear interpolation between the previous activation h t−1 and the candidate activation ĥt :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">h t = (1 − z t )h t−1 + z t ĥt (12)</formula><p>where the update gate z t is denoted by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">z t = σ (W z x t + U z h t−1 ) (13)</formula><p>and the candidate activation ĥt is given by: ĥt = tanh(WX t + U(r t ⊙ h t−1 )) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where the reset gate r t is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">r t = σ (W r X t + U r h t−1 )<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where W and U are all trainable parameters.</p><p>In the encoder phase, a two-layer bidirectional RNN is established on each input layer. To capture the difference in the short-term citing preference of authors, we establish an itembased attention mechanism on the outputs of the two-layer bidirectional RNN. The objective of the attention mechanism is to make the decoder select different parts of the input sequence dynamically and then linearly concentrate them <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. By taking the cited paper set as the example (i.e. Input #2), the attention signal is calculated as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where α ni is the matching degree between the ith hidden state and the nth target. The role of α is to represent the significance of the item in the current input sequence. According to the values of all α, the recommendation can be further decided by ignoring or emphasizing each item, which is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">c t = n ∑ i=1 α ni h ci</formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">α ni = v T σ (Ah t + Bh j ) (17)</formula><p>where v T is the trainable parameters and σ is the activate function (in this paper, reLU is used), and matrix A and B work as transfer matrices for h t , h j , respectively.</p><p>In the decoder scheme, adaptive weights that have been assigned by the encoder phase are utilized to predict potential paper candidates for citing. First, the representation of current attentions from Input #1 and #2, candidate paper entities, user entities and inquiry are integrated as the input of the a bidirectional RNN layer. Then, the score of each candidate is calculated during the RNN as well as the feedforward layers. A normalizing operation is performed by the softmax layer, so that we can derive the top N recommendations by sorting the prediction probability distribution from the output. Under this scenario, the recommendation procedure can be regarded as a multi-binary classification (recommend a candidate item or not). Thus, we train our model by using a binary cross-entropy loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">L(θ ) = − 1 n n ∑ i=1 [y i log(p i ) + (1 − y i )log(1 − p i )] (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where i indexes samples/observations, y is the sample label and p is the prediction probability distribution (p i ∈ [0, 1]).</p><p>It should be noted that this proposed method shares a similar idea that use a heterogeneous knowledge graph based embedding to generate feature and then make recommendation via a RNN network structure with our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, However, in addition to application scenario, there are significant differences between these two papers: First, the embedding method is different, we select TransD instead of TransR to better utilize both different types of entities and relations in the proposed heterogeneous knowledge graph. Second, in the attentive RNN structure, we utilize a dual-layer GRU module to extract more implicit user behavior feature. Third, the input method is also different. In this paper, there are three inputs, which are the author's previous citation list, the author's previous publication list and author query, while the previous study only uses the user's previous listening history. Thus, the corresponding network structure is changed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiment and results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Dataset and experiment setup</head><p>There have been existed several publicly available dataset for assessing the performance of the paper recommendation model, including the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, Scholarly Paper Recommendation Dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, Test Collection for Bibliographic Citation Recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, etc. In this experiment, We utilize the most extensively evaluated dataset, the DBLP dataset, to validate our method <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. The construction of the network is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and the task of author name disambiguation is undertaken according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. In addition, considering  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and a description of the relations is given in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>In the stage of implementing the recommendation model, 16,368,704 trainable parameters are utilized in total. The size of the embeddings which the proposed model uses is set to a dimension of 300. Among all embeddings, each 300-dimensional paper entity embedding is formed based on the concatenation of two parts of the sub-embeddings: the graph-based embedding takes a 100 dimensional space and the textual embedding takes the remainder. For author embedding and inquiry embedding with one source of feature, a random padding is utilized to complete the vector representation with the same alignment as the paper embedding. Each GRU layer consists of 128 hidden units in both encoder and decoder procedures. To avoid the overfitting problem, dropout is also added to the output of every bidirectional RNN layer. The dropout rate is set to 0.5 in the experiment to increase the generalization of the model. The decoder uses a 100-item candidate set to predict the recommendation. The two feedforward layers (dense layer) consist of 512 and 256 hidden units respectively with an ReLu as an activation function. Instead of using a classic Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer, our proposed model uses Adam as the basic optimization method. By implementing the whole model with Keras (version 2.2.4), the model is trained on four Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080Ti GPUs. Additionally, other hyperparameters are configured follows: The learning rate is 0.0005; The batch size is set to 128; And the total number of epochs is set to 500. We select the model with the best epoch performance on the validation set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Baseline methods</head><p>We compare the proposed model with the four methods including the two latest models for recommending papers and citations.</p><p>• PageRank-weighted CF model (PR-CF): This is a classic baseline method <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, which extends the conventional itembased CF model with graph mining methods. By using a PageRank score in the citation network, it computes the item-to-item similarity to establish a list or rank of scientific papers.</p><p>• Cluscite <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>: This study finds that citations tend to be softly clustered into interest groups based on multiple types of relationships in a co-author network. By defining five relations in the co-author network including co-author, same publication, same term, etc., it predicts each query's citations based on related interest groups, with each having its own model for paper authority and relevance.</p><p>• VOPRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>: VOPRec is a state-of-the-art hybrid paper recommendation model (GB+CB) in which the core idea is to represent papers with vectors in the citation network so that the similarity between papers can be calculated using the vectors. Specifically, it uses word2vec and structural2vec to reconstruct a citation network to derive representative vectors through graph learning and recommends similar papers to scholars according to their cosine similarity.</p><p>• Citeomatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>: Citeomatic is a state-of-the-art contentbased citation recommendation model which proposes a document-level embedding-based citation recommendation. Using textual meta data, it firstly uses the NNselect algorithm to select candidates and then it uses a re-rank method named NNrank to generate a recommendation list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Measurements for evaluation</head><p>The objective of a personalized recommendation system is to deliver a specific list of recommended objects to a specific user. Therefore, the measurements of a recommendation model should focus on the quality of recommended items themselves and the quality of the order of these items. In short, measurements are defined to measure the similarity between the recommended list and the actual list of users. In this paper, we select four evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the aforementioned and our proposed models.</p><p>• Precision@N: The precision score measures the effectiveness of a recommendation. It computes the ratio of the papers users truly cited in the top N recommendation list, which is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Precision = tp tp + fp (19)</formula><p>where in this case, tp is the number of papers that the user truly cited, and fp refers to the number of papers which were recommended to but not cited by the user.</p><p>• Recall@N: As a primary metric, recall score measures the level of integrity of the recommendation. It calculates the percentage of papers referenced by the user in the recommendation list as the cited papers in the entire candidate set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recall =</head><p>tp tp + fn <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> In our case, fn refers to the number of papers which were not recommended to but were cited by the user.</p><p>• MRR: Obviously, precision and recall only consider a set of recommendations but fail to consider the order of recommendations. To assess the quality of the order of the recommendation list, the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is utilized to calculate the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first correct answer. Assume there is a recommendation list L for a user,</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">MRR = 1 |L| ∑ i=1 |L| 1 rank i (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where rank i denotes the rank position of the first cited paper in the list in our case.</p><p>• NDCG@N: Compared with measuring the importance of the first hit in the recommendation list using MRR, normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> measures the quality of the entire ranking list. By adding a position decay factor in the process of calculating the cumulative gain, the NDCG score of a recommendation list L can be derived by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">NDCG L = DCG L IDCG L (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>where DCG L can be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">DCG L = n ∑ i=1 2 rel(i) − 1 log 2 (i + 1)<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where the rel(i) represents the rank for item i in the true list and IDCG L is the DCG value of the real order of the cited papers in our case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Results</head><p>We conducted experiments on the DBLP dataset using the four aforementioned baseline methods and our proposed model. The performance of the four measures is shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 and 5</ref>, and the performance of the recommendation is detailed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> when the size of the recommendation is set to 20.</p><p>From the results, it is observed that our proposed model outperforms the other models for a short-term recommendation list. While the size of the recommendation list increases, the precision of our model decreases. This phenomenon indicates that our approach is able to capture users' short-term preferences better than long-term behaviors. Regarding the MRR scores, this phenomenon indicates that the ''first-hit'' item of the recommended list generated by our model are of higher quality than the other models, which fits the ''user-query'' application scenario, that is, a user uses their identity and search inquiry to obtain a citation recommendation, and the first few citations recommended are the most attractive to the user and are actually the best reference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Based on the experiment and its results, several issues arise and further investigation should be conducted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">The effectiveness of graph-based embedding</head><p>As discussed in the methods section, the purpose of using TransD is to transfer a graph-based bibliographic network into numeric embedding. Therefore, two critical points need to be addressed to validate the effectiveness of this method: (1) the   (2) other indirect evidence that explains to some extent the effectiveness of using this method needs to be provided.</p><p>To answer the first question, we conducted another contrast test with different graph embedding methods to examine the variance in performance. Specifically, TransE, TransH, TransR are selected to make the comparison. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>, the TransD achieves the best performance with a slight improvement in precision, recall and NDCG compared with the second-best embedding method.</p><p>The results of the table show that the effects of using the knowledge graph-based embedding method can achieve effective recommendation performance. Among these methods, TransD has a slight advance. We believe the reasons for this advance is that the TransD uses two vectors to represent each entity or relationship, respectively. Thus, TransD can train representations in a unified space for different types of entities and different types of relationships. This diversity-aware method is more suitable for embedded expression in the heterogeneous knowledge graph used in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">The impact of different sizes of embedding</head><p>As another important issue of the experiment, the reason that we determine the dimension of embedding as 100 for graphbased data and 200 for text data should also be validated. We change the size of the embedding and the performance of the recommendation using dimension-modified embedding as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. It is also worth mentioning that when we change the dimension of one type of feature to zero, which means we are recommending citations with only the other type of feature (i.e. feature elimination experiment). It can be observed that text-based features contribute less to the accuracy of the recommendation than graphical features, which also confirms the current trends in utilizing GB methods to achieve better performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Limitations</head><p>However, several limitations should be noted. First, although a bibliographic network is established in this paper, the detailed properties regarding different types of entities are not fully utilized. As a typical example, we treat all venues as the same kind of entity whereas different journals and conferences have a different scientific impact in practice. However, the assessment of such an impact is very challenging due to the non-uniqueness of the evaluation indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Therefore, using properties in the bibliographic network requires a deeper investigation. Another example is that the order of the authors and author labels such as first author as well as corresponding author could be further considered. Adding the information of contribution could introduce more useful features. However, the current study may fail to establish these attributes into experiment, because these attributes would make the input feature more sparse (for instance, an author only holds corresponding identify on few papers while he may actually co-authored many papers), thereby causing further ''cold-start problem''. Furthermore, the corresponding author is a very important feature but cannot easily acquired from the existing DBLP database. Additionally in some extreme cases, the order of the authors is determined by the alphabetical order of the author's last name. Thus, this information was not added into the current study.</p><p>Second, the model requires a consumptive computational resources, which makes it impossible for recommendation system to rapidly re-train the model when a new user arrives. As a typical solution, the re-training process is usually performed in an offline way. Thus, an eclectic method that maps a new user to the most similar existing author in the bibliographic network can be used for online in-time service. In other words, the practical scenario requires further investigation.</p><p>Third, the proposed method may also suffer from the cold start issue. When a novel user uses the present recommendation model, what he/she can provide is only the text feature of the draft, while the graph-based features are temporarily unavailable. Therefore, our method still requires a cold start strategy to make up for these problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and future work</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed a heterogeneous knowledge embedding-based attentive RNN to recommend scientific paper and citations. First, we built a bibliographic network including papers, authors, affiliations, venues, publication years as entities and citations, publishing, working, release date and belonging as relations. Using TransD, all graphical entities and relations can be vectorized for further computation. In addition, we utilized the PV-DM model to generate numeric features for the title of each paper. Second, by focusing on the ''author-text query'' scenario, we constructed an attentive bidirectional RNN to recommend papers and citations based on a user's identity with a length-limited inquiry. The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of our method, in both the number as well as the quality of the top-N recommended citations. Compared with existing models, our model has improved MRR and NDCG by approximately 4.8% and 2.4%, respectively.</p><p>Based on the achievements as well as limitations, we believe several directions still need to be further investigated. (1) Regarding the bibliographic network we constructed in the paper, the additional attributes to entities are information-rich, which can be further utilized to undertake fine-grained paper profiling.</p><p>(2) More detailed author profiling information such as author order and corresponding label could be further considered. Second, the application on large-scale engineering systems is required to further validate its usefulness with an online trade off strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. (3) the system-level application scenario of such citation recommendation is ought to be further investigated. In detail, previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits of recommending learning objects and resources to both online and offline learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. However, the relationship between learning objects and research paper citations discussed in this paper is still under investigation and has become a significant question in intelligent tutoring systems. </p></div>
