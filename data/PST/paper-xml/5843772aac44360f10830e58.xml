<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>D URING the past few decades, sliding mode control (SMC) as a powerful nonlinear control technique has been extensively investigated because of its insensitivity and complete robustness to the so-called matched uncertainties or disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It is worth mentioning that, the system possess the property of insensitivity and complete robustness to the matched uncertainties or disturbances during the sliding mode, while might be sensitive to the matched uncertainties or disturbances during the reaching mode. To guarantee the system possess the insensitivity or complete robustness throughout an entire response of the system starting from the initial time instance, the so-called integral SMC (ISMC). In addition to the absence of a reaching phase feature, the ISMC design also maintains the aforementioned advantages of conventional SMC. In recent few years, the ISMC has been received a lot of attention, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and the references therein.</p><p>It should be pointed out that, the invariance property against the matched uncertainties or disturbances is accomplished by incorporating a discontinuous term in the controller, which results in the high frequency chattering behavior of the input and the sliding surface function. To reduce or even eliminate the chattering effects, the simple and attractive approach is to soften the discontinuous control term by its continuous approximation at the cost of a slight deterioration of control performances. For example, the signum function sgn(σ(t)) in the controller can be approximated by the saturation function sat(σ(t)) or σ(t) σ(t) +δ with σ(t) being the sliding surface function and δ being a sufficient small scalar. More recently, several authors introduce a disturbance observer in SMC to alleviate the chattering effects, the basic idea is to construct the SMC law by incorporating the disturbance estimate to compensate the disturbance straightforwardly. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the disturbance observer based SMC approach is developed for second-order system with mismatched uncertainties, and the results are extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the adaptive neural output feedback control scheme is proposed for uncertain nonlinear systems with unknown hysteresis, external disturbances and unmeasured states. For the discrete-time systems, if the disturbances vary slowly between within each sampling interval, then the disturbance d(k) can be approximated by d(k -1), and d(k -1) can be implemented in the controller to cancel the unknown present disturbance d(k) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, the disturbance observer based integral sliding mode control (DOB-ISMC) problems will be addressed for continuous-time linear systems with mismatched disturbance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the DOB-based SMC is considered for a special second order system with mismatched uncertainties. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> improve the SMC approaches for secondorder systems proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to general n-th order systems with mismatched uncertainties, and some novel disturbance observers and sliding surfaces are presented. Motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, in this paper, the plant is a general linear system with mismatched disturbance, and both the memoryless and memory-based DOB-integral sliding surfaces are proposed based on the disturbance estimates. Then, the H ∞ control and stead-state output based approaches have been presented to design the controller and the disturbance rejection gains. Furthermore, both the robust and adaptive sliding mode controllers are also designed. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) The disturbance observer is proposed for general linear system with mismatched disturbance, and the disturbance estimate based integral sliding surface and integral sliding mode controller are also established; 2) The H ∞ control and stead-state output based strategies are given to design the controller gain and disturbance rejection gain;</p><p>3) The memory-based integral sliding surface and integral sliding mode control approach are also proposed to improve the transient control performance. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out to validate the proposed method. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ẋ(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) + B d d(t) y(t) = Cx(t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x(t) ∈ R n is the state variable, u(t) ∈ R m is the control variable, d(t) ∈ R q represents the mismatched disturbance. A, B, C and B d are known real constant matrices of appropriate dimensions which satisfies the following assumption. Assumption 1: The pair (A, B) is controllable, and matrices B and B d are of full collum, i.e. rank(B) = m and rank(B d ) = q, respectively. For the mismatched disturbance, we need the following assumption.</p><p>Assumption 2: The mismatched disturbance d(t) is assumed to satisfy the following conditions d(t) ≤ α and ḋ(t) ≤ β, where α and β are two positive constants.</p><p>Remark 1: It is worth mentioning that the conditions in Assumption 2 are presented for rigorous stability analysis. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, if the disturbance d(t) contains some state variables, i.e., d(t) = d(x, t), it is difficult to strictly prove the stability for this general disturbance d(x, t), which is one technical difficulty in the disturbance estimator based control community, including ADRC and DOBC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Disturbance Observer</head><p>Motivated by the disturbance observers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the following disturbance observer can be employed</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v(t) = Λ d(t) + ΛB † d (Ax(t) + Bu(t)) d(t) = v(t) -ΛB † d x(t)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">B † d = B T d B d -1 B T d , d(t)</formula><p>is the disturbance estimate, v(t) is the internal variable vector of the observer, and Λ is the Hurwitz matrix chosen by designer. For simplicity, we assume d(0) = 0. Define the disturbance estimation error d(t) = d(t) -d(t), and it can be shown that d(t) is bounded under the Assumption 2. We first recall the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 1: <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> Assume A ∈ R n×n is Hurwitz, then there exists a scalar c &gt; 0 such that e At ≤ ce λmax (A) 2</p><p>t .</p><p>Then, we have the following result.

Thus, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ḋ(t) = ḋ(t) + Λ d(t)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>which further gives that d(t) = e Λt d(0) + t 0 e Λ(t-s) ḋ(s)ds. Thus, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d(t) ≤ e Λt d(0) + t 0 e Λ(t-s) ḋ(s)ds ≤ e Λt d(0) + t 0 e Λ(t-s) ḋ(s) ds ≤ cαe λmax (Λ) 2 t + cβ t 0 e λmax (Λ) 2 (t-s) ds = cαe λmax (Λ) 2 t + cβ 2 λ max (Λ) e λmax (Λ) 2 t -1 ≤ cα -cβ 2 λ max (Λ) .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>By defining = cα -cβ 2 λmax(Λ) , we can get d(t) satisfies d(t) ≤ immediately, and the proof is completed.</p><p>Remark 2: It follows from Lemma 2 that, the parameter matrix Λ in the disturbance observer (2) should be selected as Hurwitz and λ max (Λ) should be large enough.</p></div>

In order to reduce chattering in an actual implementation, the discontinuous function can be replaced IV. MEMORY-BASED DOB-ISMC In this section, the memory-based DOB-ISMC will be addressed. It is well known that integral action always causes undesirable transient control performances, such as large overshoot and long settling time. To the authors' best knowledge, the memory-based control strategies, which involve not only the current and past information of the systems in controllers, may outperform the memoryless control strategies in performance improvement.</p><p>Select the following memory-based DOB-integral sliding surface as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">σ(t) = B † x(t) -x(0) - t 0 Ax(s) + Bu 2 (s) + B d d(s) ds = 0 (18)</formula><p>where u 2 (t) = -Kx(t) -K τ x(t -τ ) -K d d(t), τ is the memory parameter, K and K τ are the controller gains, and K d is the disturbance rejection gain to be determined later.</p><p>Remark 6: Compared with the DOB-integral sliding mode surface ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), the memory-based DOB-integral sliding surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> includes the historical information of the state variables. It can be observed that u 2 (t) in ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">u 2 (t) = -K 1 x(t) + K 2 x(t)-x(t-τ ) τ -K d d(t), where K 1 = K + τ K τ and K 2 = τ K τ . Note that ẋ(t) ≈ x(t)-x(t-τ ) τ</formula><p>, thus the memory-based DOB-integral sliding surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> possesses the derivative control action. According to the well-known PID control theory, a derivative control action can improve the transient performance of the control system; thus, the memory-based DOB-integral SMC approach may provide a better performance, which can be seen from the simulation examples. Unfortunately, it is difficult to formally proved that why memory based controller gives better performance for a general system.</p><p>Then, if α and β are known, the memory-based DOBintegral sliding mode controller can be designed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">u(t) = u 2 (t) + B † B d u N (t),<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where u N (t) = -(ρ + )</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">B T d B †T σ(t) B T d B †T σ(t) , ρ &gt; 0.</formula><p>Theorem 3: With the controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, the reachability condition of sliding motion can be reached, i.e., the state trajectories of the closed-loop systems will be globally driven onto sliding surface σ(t) in finite time.</p><p>Proof: Consider the Lyapunov function candidate as</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">V (t) = 1 2 σ T (t)σ(t).</formula><p>The derivative of σ(t) along time is</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">σ(t) = B † Ax(t) + Bu(t) + B d d(t) -(Ax(t) + Bu 2 (t) + B d d(t)) = u(t) -u 2 (t) + B † B d d(t) = B † B d u N (t) + d(t)<label>(20)</label></formula><p>thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">V (t) = σ T (t) σ(t) = σ T (t) -(ρ + ) B † B d B T d B †T σ(t) B T d B †T σ(t) + B † B d d(t) = -(ρ + ) B T d B †T σ(t) + σ T (t)B † B d d(t) ≤ -ρ B T d B †T σ(t)<label>(21)</label></formula><p>which implies that σ T (t) σ(t) ≤ 0, thus the reachability condition can be guaranteed. Similarly, we have the following sliding motion equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">ẋ(t) = Ax(t) + Bu eq (t) + B d d(t) = (A -BK)x(t) -BK τ x(t -τ ) + (BK d -BB † B d ) d(t) + (B d -BK d )d(t).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS A. Numerical Simulations</head><p>In this section, we apply the proposed control schemes to stabilize a ball and beam system. The beam is made to rotate in a vertical plane by applying a torque at the center of rotation, and the ball is placed on the beam, where it is free to roll (with 1 DOF) along the beam. We will assume that the ball remains in contact with the beam and the rolling occurs without slipping, which imposes a constraint on the rotational acceleration of the beam. The parameters used in this system are shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. By choosing the beam angle θ and the ball position r as generalized position coordinates for the system, the Lagrangian equations of motion are given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_48">0 =( J b R 2 + M )r + M g sin θ -M r θ2 (32) τ =(M r 2 + J + J b ) θ + 2M r ṙ θ + M gr cos θ (<label>33</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_49">)</formula><p>where τ is the torque applied to the beam.

By implementing the adaptive DOB-ISMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, and selecting the parameters listed in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, and x(0) = [1, 0, 0, 0] T , the response curves of the real and estimated disturbance, and the state responses with and without disturbance observer is shown respectively in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. It can be easily observed that the proposed DOB-ISMC approaches in this paper provide better performance than the approaches without disturbance observer.</p><p>As we have shown in Section III-B, the disturbance rejection K d can be designed by the steady-state output based approach. By taking K = [ 2.1363 4.4146 29.1514 10.2274 ], it can be verify that the Lyapunov inequality (A -BK) T P + P (A -BK) &lt; 0 is feasible, which implies that A -BK is Hurwitz. Here, K d is determined as K d = [ 4.1602 0.1000 ] according <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Simulation results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, and it can also be seen that the proposed DOB-ISMC approaches in this paper outperform the traditional ISMC approaches.  x Next, we examine the effectiveness of the proposed memory-based DOB-ISMC approach. According to the H ∞ control based approach proposed in Section IV, and selecting the parameters given in Table <ref type="table">II</ref> shows the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches. It can be seen from the simulation results, the control input u(t) increase largely at the initial stage. To address this problem, the saturated sliding mode control approach should be developed in the future works. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Practical Experiment</head><p>In this subsection, we further consider the ball and beam shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, and implement the proposed control schemes established in Section III to the ball and beam system produced by Googol Technology Limited. The system parameters are given in subsection V-A. Control algorithm and data acquisition and visualization were realized with MathWorks Matlab and Simulink.</p><p>The control objective is to stabilize the ball at the middle of the beam, i.e., r = 0.2m. By implementing the following controller modified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">u 1 (t) = Kr(t) -Kx(t) -K d d(t) + B † B d u N (t),<label>(43)</label></formula><p>where r(t) = 0.2 0 0 0 T , d(t), u N (t), K and K d are given in the previous subsection. Suppose the plant is affected by sinusoidal matched disturbance 0.08 • sin(10t) and the observer parameter is given as Λ = diag{-0.5, -1.0}. We can get the following realtime experimental results of ball and beam system shown in   Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> gives the experiment results of integral sliding mode control, H ∞ control and the proposed control approach. The comparisons show that our approach (H ∞ control based DOB-ISMC) presents better performances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, the DOB-ISMC problem for continuoustime linear systems mismatched disturbance or uncertainties is investigated. To counteract the disturbance, the disturbance estimate, generated by disturbance observer, is incorporated in the sliding surfaces and controllers. The memoryless and memory-based DOB-ISMC approaches are developed respectively to design the integral sliding surfaces and integral sliding mode controllers. It can be seen that the proposed memorybased DOB-ISMC can results in the better transient control performances. Numerical example and experiment are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches.</p><p>Motivated by the recent important works <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, our future attention will be devoted on designing the sliding mode controllers for networked control systems (NCSs) and process control systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
