<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Our investigation focuses on an extended form of mobile computing in which users employ many different mobile, stationary and embedded computers over the course of the day. In this model computation does not occur at a single location in a single context, as in desktop computing, but rather spans a multitude of situations and locations covering the office, meeting room, home, airport, hotel, classroom, market, bus, etc. Users might access their computing resources from wireless portable machines and also through stationary devices and computers connected to local area networks.</p><p>We call this collection of mobile and stationary computing devices that are communicating and cooperating on the user's behalf a mobile dzstnbuted COTl!putmg system. This form of computing is broader than mobile computing because it concerns mobile people not just mobile computers. These systems aim to provide ubiquitous access to information, comrnunication, and computation.</p><p>One significant aspect of this emerging mode of computing is the constantly changing execution euvironment. The processors available for a task. the devices accessible for user input and display, the network capacity, connectivity, and costs lllay all change over time and place. In short, the hardware configuration is continually changing. Similarly, the computer user may move from one location to another, joining and leaving groups of people, and frequently interacting with computers while in changing social situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Context-Aware Computing</head><p>One challenge of mobile distributed computing is to exploit the changing environment with a new class of applications that are aware of the context in which they are run. Such contexl-aware systems adapts according to the location of use, the collection of nearby people, hosts, and accessible devices. as well as to changes to such things over time. A system with these capabilities can examine the computing environment and react to changes to the environment.</p><p>Three important aspects of context are: where you are, who you are with, and what resources are nearby (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Context encompasses more than just the user's location, because other things of interest are also rnobile and changing. Context includes lighting, noise level, network connectivity, communication costs, communication bandwidth. and even the social situation: e.g., whether you are with your IlIanager or with a co-worker.</p><p>We are investigating these kinds of applicat ions using the PARcTAB [1, 7], a slTlall hand held device which uses an infrared-based cellular network for communication. The tah acts as a graphics terminal, and most applications run on remote hosts. This design exploits remote processing power to achieve a smaller and cheaper device. For input, the tab has three finger-operated buttons on the grip, and a touch sensitive screen. For output, the tab has a 128x6'1 pixel display and a piezo-clectric speaker. When wired with an infrared transceiver, a room becomes a cell in the infrared network. The total handwidth available for all tabs in a cell is 19,200 bps.</p><p>The com bination of room-sized cells, and tabs that periodically send an identifying packet (i.e., beacon), permits accurate location monitoring even when the device is not being used. The system notifies applications of location changes, and also provides location information to a puhlic service that collects and redistributes information about objects and their locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Other systems rnight learn about location by other means: for example, by using global positioning (CPS) or dead-reckoning, or simply by monitoring worksta-tion interactions. An alternative to the tab svstem's locating scheme -where the mobile devices b~aconis a scheme where stationary devices broadcast a message identifying their fixed l~cation. Mobile computers can listen to these broadcasts to determine their own locations.</p><p>The devices and locating strategy described above combine to form a mechanism for building contextaware appl ications. In the following sections we describe four categories of context-aware applications. These categories are the product of two points along two orthogonal dimensions (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>): whether the task at hand is getting information or carrying out a command, and whether it is effected maImallvor au tomatically. .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Proximate Selection</head><p>ProJ:imate selection is a user interface technique where the located-objects that are nearby are emphasized or otherwise made easier to choose. In general. proximate selection involves entering a "locus" aIlt1 a "selection." However, of particular interest are user interfaces that automatically default the locus to the user's current location.</p><p>There are at least three kinds of located-objects that arc interesting to select using this technique. The first kind is computer input and output devices that require physical interaction. This includes printers, displays, speakers, facsimiles, video cameras, thermostats, and so on. Allother example is people in the same room to whom you would like to "beam" a document. The second kind is situated non-physical objects and services"that are routinely accessed from particular locations; for example, bank accounts, menus, and lists of instructions or regulations. The third killd is the set of places one wants to find out about: restaurants, night clubs, gas stations, and stores, or more generically, exits and entrances. Consider an electronic "yellow pages" directory that, instead of the subject divisions of information. sorts represented businesses according to their distance from the reader.</p><p>Location information can be used to weight the choices of printers that are nearby. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows proximate selection dialogs for printers using three columns: the name of the printer, the location, and a distance from the user. One interface issue is how to navigate dialogs that contain this additional location information. For example, should dialogs use the familiar alphahetical ordering by name or should they be ordered by location. Shown here are (a) alphabetically orderi ng by name; (b) ordered by proxim ity; (c) alphabetical with nearby printers emphasized; (d) alphabetical with font size scaled by proximity, something like a perspective view.</p><p>Another factor that proximate selection interfaces must take into account is bandwidth requirements. Presenting information that changes, either due to the user moving or the contents of the dialog changing (e.g. other people movillg) will cause update network traffic. One approach is to view location information with more or less precision based on the situation. The interfaces in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> are fine-grained --the distance column requires updating for each change in location of the locus. In contrast a coarser-grained view of the same information might show a zone rather than a distance. Driving around town with such a dialog would, for example, change only when the viewer, or the objects in the selection dialog, crossed the city limits.</p><p>Proximate selection may also be used to choose virtualobjects. Using the PARcTAB voting application, users select previously created ballots either alphabetically or by the current location. This use of proximate selection is helpful when ballots are carried out at particular locations -e.g., voting on what snacks to have at High Tea -or when you are meeting with a group that has just created a ballot.</p><p>User interfaces for proximate selection pose some challenges. For example, how can a UI display both alphabetical and proximity information simultaneously. Map imagery may provide a good UI metaphor. Since proximate selection may occur on a mobile host, the VI techniques developed must take into account device capa bi Iities such as screen real-estate and communication bandwidth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Automatic Contextual Reconfiguration</head><p>Heconfiguration is the process of adding new components, removing existing components. or altering the connectiolls between components. Typical components are servers and connections are their communication channels to clients. However reconfigurable components may also include loadable device drivers, program modules, hard ware elements, etc. In the case of context-aware systems, the interesting aspect is how context of use might bring about different system configurations and what these adaptions are.</p><p>When a group of people is in one place, the people can easily share the physical objects in that place. For example, people in a meeting room share a table that might hold scattered papers, and a whiteboard with diagrams. To promote similar sharing, we wrote a multi-user drawing program for the PARcTAB which provides a workspace for each room, a sort of virtual whiteboard. Entering a room causes an automatic binding between the mobile host and the room's virtual whiteboard. In this way people in the same room can easily collaborate using the virtual whiteboard. :\Ioving to a different room brings up a different drawing surface. Automatic reconfiguration creates the illusion of accessing this virtnal object as if it were physical.</p><p>Reconfiguration could be based on other information in addition to location, for example, the people present in a room. If a project group is meetillg then the projcet whiteboard is active. This change makes virtnal whiteboards more powerful than their physical analogues since a virtual whiteboard can persist from meeting to meeting, and can follow participants from room to room.</p><p>Contextual reconfiguration might also include operating system fUllctions: for example, leaving the disk spinning when the mobile has a power connection. Schilit and Duchamp <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> describe how an operating systpm can use the memory of nearby idle computers for backing store, rather than swapping to a local Systems that reconfigure based on context. are Sll bject to the same problems faced by reconfigurable systems in general. In addition, if the contpxt is changing rapidly it may be distracting to the user or impractical (due to performance) to adapt. to every change. Also, cert ain adaptions may confuse users, particularly if the context is incorrectly reported, if t.he user is unctWare of what context. an application considers relevant, or if the cont.ext. changes during lise. Fllt.ure work shouk! address t.hese issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Contextual Information and Commands</head><p>People's act.ions can oft.en be predict.ed by t heir situation. There are certain things we regularly do when in til(' lihrrtry, kit.chen. or officf'. Contextual infoI'lna-tion and commands aim to exploit. t.his fact. Queries on contex ual infol'lllation can produce different results according to t.he context in which they are issued. Similarly, cont.ext can parameterize "contextual commands," for example, the print command might, by default., print to the nearest printer.</p><p>The location browser is a PARCTAB application t.hat. views a "Iocat.ion-based filesvstem." Directories are named after locations and contain files, programs, and links. \Yhen moving from room to roOlll, the browser changes the displayed direct.ory to match the viewer's location. For example, when in an office we see the occupant.'s finger plan and calendar files. In t.he public area of our lab we see a general description of t.he research group, and when near the kit.chen we see directions for making coffee and finding supplies. Location directories are writable so anyone in our group can add customized informat.ion. A researcher might leaH' an electronic post-it not.e for colleagues telling them when she plans to return to the office.  Aside from displaying data files parameterized by the viewer's location, the location browser also rims programs. Contextual commands of this kind Illay take two forms, First" the appearance of the command itself might change depending on context of use. For example, when in the library the button to invoke a card catalogue database might appear prominently whereas it is normallv hidden. Second. a command may appear the same-but prouuce para'meterized results. For example the location browser presents a migrate button in it's user interface that appears identical from room to room. When this button is pressed the user's workstation applicatioll migrates its windows to a nearby display.</p><p>The location browser contrasts with Scoreboard <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, an application that takes advantage of large (:3x4 foot), stationary, displays in public areas. The program monitors which users pass by and are ill the vicinity and then shows informcttion that they &lt;'HC interested in, e.g., the latest hockey scores. A third example of exploiting contextual information is Lamming and Newman's activity-based inforrnation retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In this application, information entered into the computer is taggeu with context keys facilitating future retrieval by using those keys. Contextual information and commands pose some challenges. Consider businesscs and govern ment agencies that would export contextued information and commands to inexpensively advertise and assist large numbers of potential customers. People interacting in this manner need to ensure security and authenticity of the information. Also, persona.l cllsloillizations mllst somehow coordinate with service providers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Context-Triggered Actions</head><p>Context-triggered actions are simple IF-TIIEi\ rules used to specify how COli text-aware systems should adapt. Informat.ion about context-of-use in a condit ion clause triggers consequent commands; somet.hing like Jiving in a rule-based expert system! A number of applications can be organized in this way. The category of context-triggered actions is similar to contextual information and commands, except that (hese actions are invoked automatically according t.o previ-ollsly specified rules. A sample predicate set might include the forms in Figure :3. The badge and locat ion are strings t hat match t Iw badge wearer and sighting location. The event-type is a badge event type: arriving, departing, settled-in, missing. or attention", \Vhen a rnatchingevent occurs, Watchdog invokf&gt;s the action with a set of Unix environnwn(. variables as parameters. These include the badge owner, oWller's office, sighting location, anu the name of the nearest host. For example, see Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The first example mOllitors the "coffee" badge-which is attached (.0 the coffee maker in the kitchell-and plays the roosler sound whenever anyone makes coffee. The second start.s an Emacs window at a nearby host whenever the attention signal is received,</p><p>In addition to generating the normal functiolls of reminders eLt certain dates and times. Contex lIal Reminders permit. a fuller description of the si(.uation for when a I't~mincler should OCCllr. A message pops up according to when. where, who and what is with you, For example, the "next time in the library" or the '"next time I sec Ylarvill," or "when I'm back at my desk." The PARCT.-\ B implement ation of Contextual Reminders pops lip a message on the tab when different situations occur, The user mav edit the reminder, dismiss it. or ignore it. .</p><p>I The Active Badge <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> is a tag that pe,.io(licall~• broadcasts a unique identificr fur the purpuse of dctermining the locatiun of the wearer.</p><p>2Thc badge incorporatcs a bul ton, and the attention c\'ent is reported when this button is clicked twice. The problems of building context-t.riggered actions include how to balance the requirement of t.imely execution with the need for predictable behavior, when systems transition between a number of states it may not be desirable to have all t.he intermediary actions triggered, but delaying too long will make the system seem sluggish. Two problems to be addressed are the expressiveness of the predicate language, and the accuracy and timeliness of the underlying context information.</p></div>
