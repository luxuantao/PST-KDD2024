<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In a conventional wireless cellular system, signal processing is performed on a per-cell basis; out-of-cell interference is treated as background noise. This paper considers the benefit of coordinating base-stations across multiple cells in a multi-antenna beamforming system, where multiple base-stations may jointly optimize their respective beamformers to improve the overall system performance. Consider a multicell downlink scenario where base-stations are equipped with multiple transmit antennas employing either linear beamforming or nonlinear dirty-paper coding, and where remote users are equipped with a single antenna each, but where multiple remote users may be active simultaneously in each cell. This paper focuses on the design criteria of minimizing either the total weighted transmitted power or the maximum per-antenna power across the base-stations subject to signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) constraints at the remote users. The main contribution of the paper is an efficient algorithm for finding the joint globally optimal beamformers across all base-stations. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalization of uplink-downlink duality to the multicell setting using the Lagrangian duality theory. An important feature is that it naturally leads to a distributed implementation in time-division duplex (TDD) systems. Simulation results suggest that coordinating the beamforming vectors alone already provide appreciable performance improvements as compared to the conventional per-cell optimized network.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>across the different base-stations to minimize or even to cancel intercell interference.</p><p>This paper evaluates the benefit of one particular type of base-station coordination for the multicell downlink system. The setup here is a scenario in which the base-stations are equipped with multiple antennas and the remote receivers are equipped with a single antenna each. Within each cell, multiple remote users may be active simultaneously and are separated via spatial multiplexing using beamforming. In a conventional system, the beamforming vectors in each cell are set independently. The main point of this paper is that it is possible to improve the overall network performance by allowing beamforming vectors from different base-stations to be coordinated.</p><p>The system setup in this paper differs from many of the coordinated joint processing systems studied in the literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) where antennas from multiple basestations act as a single antenna array. Such a fully coordinated case is sometime referred to as "network MIMO" (multipleinput multiple-output), where much larger performance gains are conceivable. However, network MIMO comes at a cost of signal-level coordination, i.e. data streams intended for different mobile users belonging to different cells need to be shared among the base-stations. In contrast, the system considered in this paper only requires coordination at the beamforming level, and is therefore much easier to implement. Downlink beamforming for multi-antenna wireless systems has been studied extensively in the literature. A concept known as uplink-downlink duality has emerged as a main tool. This paper extends duality to the multicell setting by establishing that the multicell downlink beamforming problem for minimizing either the total weighted transmit power or the maximum per-antenna power subject to the received signal-tonoise-and-interference-ratio (SINR) constraints can be solved via a dual uplink problem. The duality holds for both linear transmit beamforming and for the nonlinear dirty-paper coded system. The main contribution of this paper is an efficient algorithm, which is capable of finding the globally optimal downlink beamforming vector across all base-stations. This algorithm is a multicell generalization of a similar algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for the single-cell case. A key advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it naturally leads to a distributed implementation in a time-division duplex (TDD) system.</p><p>As an alternative to the transmit power minimization problem mentioned above, one can also formulate a rate-region maximization problem subject to power constraints at the basestations. Both problems are of practical interest. Although it is possible to show that uplink-downlink duality continues to hold for the rate region maximization problem under suitable conditions (e.g. sum power constraint across all the transmitters), numerical optimization of achievable rate regions becomes much more difficult. For this reason, the remainder of this paper restricts its attention to the power minimization problem subject to SINR constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Related Work</head><p>The benefit of base-station coordination in a cellular network has been a subject of many recent studies. Motivated by the joint detection and cooperation techniques for intracell interference mitigation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> study the capacity improvement due to the joint encoding or decoding across the base-stations for intercell interference mitigation. Base-station coordination is practically conceivable because in a cellular network base-stations are connected by highcapacity backhaul links. However, the amount of backhaul communications required to achieve joint processing is also substantial. This motivates network models with either constrained backhaul capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or with cooperation only among neighboring base-stations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or among cluster of base-stations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The problem setting in this paper differs from the above series of works in that rather than joint processing at a signal level, we consider coordination at the beamformer level, which requires much less overhead and is more practical to implement. In particular, the data stream for each user only needs to be (pre-)processed at its own base-station (and not across all the base-stations). Further, the base-stations need not be symbol synchronized as required with signal-level coordination. With these practical considerations, this paper focuses on the joint optimization of transmit beamformers across the base-stations for minimizing the transmit power subject to quality-of-service constraints at the mobiles. This setup is suitable for constant bit-rate traffic with stringent delay constraints. As the simulation results of this paper show, appreciable performance gain can already be obtained with this limited form of coordination. Related works based on the minimization of packet loss probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the maximization of capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have also been reported in the literature.</p><p>The transmit beamforming design problem goes back to the classic work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where an iterative algorithm is proposed for the optimization of the beamforming vectors and power allocations to satisfy a set of target SINRs for an arbitrary set of transmission links. The main contribution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is a beamformer-power update algorithm based on an uplink-downlink duality that converges to a feasible solution to the problem. In the single-cell multi-user downlink case, the optimality of this duality-based approach is proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> shows that the singlecell downlink beamforming problem can be formulated as a second-order cone-programming problem. This crucial insight allows an interpretation of duality via Lagrangian theory in convex optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The single-cell uplink-downlink duality can be immediately generalized to the multicell setting if signal-level coordination between the base-stations is assumed. This is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> in a CDMA context, where a beamformer-power iteration algorithm similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is proposed.</p><p>Less obvious is the question of whether uplink-downlink duality continues to hold in a multicell network with beamforming-level coordination only. This paper uses a Lagrangian duality approach to establish that duality indeed exists in this case. In addition, this paper proposes an optimization procedure based on power iteration alone. The proposed algorithm has a key advantage of being amenable to distributed implementation, which is highly desirable in a multicell network. Further, this paper takes realistic power constraint into account by solving the problem of minimizing the maximum per-antenna power constraint across all the basestations. Finally, this paper provides a generalization to include dirty-paper coding within each cell.</p><p>The multicell uplink-downlink duality considered in this paper is related to the concept of network duality proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, the network duality established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is derived based on a linear programming approach, which is different from the Lagrangian approach taken in this paper. Consequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> arrives at a different set of numerical algorithms for the coordinated beamforming problem, which happen to be not as easily implementable in a distributed fashion. In fact, to obtain distributed solutions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> has to resort to suboptimal algorithms. As a further note, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> deals with the more general problem of joint transmit and receive beamforming optimization for a multicell network where both the base-station and the remote users are equipped with multiple antennas. Although uplink-downlink duality continues to hold, one consequence of this more general setup is that the proof of global optimality is no longer available, in contrast to the simpler single-antenna-per-remote-user case considered in this paper. Finally, the coordinated beamforming problem can also be solved using yet another different approach based on treating all the base-stations as a single transmitter, then modifying the corresponding channel matrix and determining the corresponding optimal beamforming vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. However, distributed implementation of the resulting algorithm is not yet available.</p><p>Coordination at the beamforming-level for the multicell multi-antenna channel has also been explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> from a viewpoint of egotistic vs. altruistic strategies. These works focus on the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region of the multicell network under fixed power constraint, which is complementary to the problem of power minimization under fixed SINR constraints considered in this paper. The achievable rate region of multicell systems has also been explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> using duality, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> deals with a more general setting with different possible levels of coordination between the base-stations. The problem setting of the current paper corresponds to a particular limited coordination scenario in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> also addresses the issue of imperfect channel knowledge at the base-stations.</p><p>The problem setting of this paper assumes that the set of active mobile users with each cell and their respective SINR constraints are fixed. User scheduling (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>) and congestion control strategies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>) are assumed to be performed separately. Throughout the paper, perfect channel side information for mobile users within each cell is assumed to be available at each base-station. In a practical implementation, channel side information may be estimated via channel reciprocity for a TDD system or via a feedback mechanism; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION A. System Model</head><p>This paper considers a multicell multi-user spatial multiplex system with 𝑁 cells and 𝐾 users per cell with 𝑁 𝑡 antennas at each base-station and a single antenna at each remote user. Multiuser downlink transmit beamforming is employed at each base-station. Let 𝑥 𝑖,𝑗 be a complex scalar denoting the information signal for the 𝑗th user in the 𝑖th cell, and w i,j ∈ 𝒞 𝑁𝑡×1 be its associated beamforming vector. The received signal at the 𝑗th remote user in the 𝑖th cell, denoted as 𝑦 𝑖,𝑗 ∈ 𝒞, is a summation of the intended signal, intracell interference, and intercell interference:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑦 𝑖,𝑗 = ∑ 𝑙 h 𝐻 i,i,j w i,l 𝑥 𝑖,𝑙 + ∑ 𝑚∕ =𝑖,𝑛</formula><p>h 𝐻 m,i,j w m,n 𝑥 𝑚,𝑛 + 𝑧 𝑖,𝑗 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where h l,i,j ∈ 𝒞 𝑁𝑡×1 is the vector channel from the basestation of the 𝑙th cell to the 𝑗th user in the 𝑖th cell, and 𝑧 𝑖,𝑗 is the additive white circularly symmetric Gaussian complex noise with variance 𝜎 2 /2 on each of its real and imaginary components. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the system model for a network with seven cells and three users per cell.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Transmit Beamforming Problem</head><p>The beamformer design problem is that of minimizing some function of transmit power across all base-stations subject to SINR constraints at the remote users. With w i,j as the beamforming vectors, the SINR for the 𝑗th user in the 𝑖th cell can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Γ 𝑖,𝑗 = |w 𝐻 i,j h i,i,j | 2 ∑ 𝑙∕ =𝑗 |w 𝐻 i,l h i,i,j | 2 + ∑ 𝑚∕ =𝑖,𝑛 |w 𝐻 m,n h m,i,j | 2 + 𝜎 2</formula><p>(2) Let 𝛾 𝑖,𝑗 be the SINR target for the 𝑗th user in the 𝑖th cell. We can then formulate, for example, a total transmit power minimization problem as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">minimize ∑ 𝑖,𝑗 w 𝐻 i,j w i,j<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">subject to Γ 𝑖,𝑗 ≥ 𝛾 𝑖,𝑗 , ∀𝑖 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝑁, 𝑗 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝐾</formula><p>where the minimization is over the w i,j 's. Throughout this paper, we assume that the set of SINR targets are feasible. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Conventional Systems</head><p>In a conventional wireless cellular system, the multiuser beamforming problem is solved on a per-cell basis; out-ofcell interference is regarded as a part of background noise. In particular, for a fixed base-station î, a conventional system finds the optimal set of w î,j , 𝑗 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝐾, assuming that all other (𝑁 -1)𝐾 beamformers are fixed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">minimize ∑ 𝑗 w 𝐻 î,j w î,j<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">subject to Γ î,𝑗 ≥ 𝛾 î,𝑗 , ∀𝑗 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝐾</formula><p>where Γ î,𝑗 is given by ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>). This single-cell downlink problem has a classic solution as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Note that in a conventional system, the choice of beamformers at each base-station affects the background noise level at neighboring cells, and hence the setting of beamformers in neighboring base-stations. Thus, the above per-cell optimization is in practice performed iteratively until the system converges to a per-cell optimal solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Motivating Example for Joint Optimization</head><p>This paper is motivated by the observation that the percell optimization above does not necessarily lead to a joint optimal solution. Significant performance improvement may be obtained if base-stations coordinate in jointly optimizing all of their beamformers at the same time. The following example illustrates this point.</p><p>Consider a multicell network but with only a single user per cell. The per-cell optimization reduces to the optimal transmit beamforming problem for a multi-input single-output (MISO) system with a background noise level which includes outof-cell interference. Note that regardless of the level of the background noise, the optimal per-cell transmit beamformer is a vector that matches the channel. Thus, in this example, percell optimization across the cells converges in one iterationevery base-station uses a transmit beamformer that matches the MISO channel.</p><p>This channel-matching solution is not necessarily the joint optimum. For example, when two users belonging to two different cells are near each other at the cell edge, it may be advantageous to steer the beamforming vectors for the two base-stations away from each other so as to reduce mutual interference. Such a joint optimal beamforming solution may lead to higher received SINRs at a fixed transmit power, or conversely a lower transmit power at fixed SINRs.</p><p>One of the first algorithms for solving the multicell joint beamforming optimization problem is given by Rashid-Farrokhi, Liu and Tassiulas <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. They showed that the optimal downlink beamforming problem under SINR constraints can be solved efficiently by an iterative uplink beamformer and power update algorithm. It is well known that the uplink beamforming problem is much easier to solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Thus, by transforming the downlink problem into the uplink domain, the downlink problem may be solved efficiently as well.</p><p>The global optimality of the beamformer-power iteration algorithm has been shown for the single-cell case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This paper gives a rigorous derivation of duality for the multicell case, then proposes a new algorithm for solving the joint multicell downlink beamforming problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. UPLINK-DOWNLINK DUALITY FOR MULTICELL SYSTEMS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Minimization of Weighted Transmitted Power</head><p>We begin by formulating a slightly more general version of the transmit beamforming problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. In a multicell system, each base-station (or sometime each antenna) typically has its own power constraint. Thus, it is useful to consider a problem of minimizing the weighted total transmit power, with the transmit power at the 𝑖th base-station weighted by a factor 𝛼 𝑖 . In this case, (3) becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">minimize ∑ 𝑖,𝑗 𝛼 𝑖 w 𝐻 i,j w i,j<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">subject to Γ 𝑖,𝑗 ≥ 𝛾 𝑖,𝑗 , ∀𝑖 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝑁, 𝑗 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝐾</formula><p>The SINR target constraints in (5) may appear nonconvex.</p><p>In a study of single-cell downlink beamforming problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> showed that SINR constraints of this type can be transformed into a second-order-cone constraint (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>). This crucial observation enables methods for solving (5) via convex optimization.</p><p>Uplink-downlink duality refers to the fact that the minimum transmit power needed to achieve a certain set of SINR constraints in a downlink channel is the same as the minimum total transmit power needed to achieve the same set of SINR targets in an uplink channel, where the uplink channel is obtained by reversing the input and the output of the downlink. The main goal of this section is to show that uplink-downlink duality, previously established for the single-cell case, carries over to the multicell setting. The following theorem is a multicell generalization of the single-cell duality result as stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The proof is based on a Lagrangian technique, similar to the approach used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 1: The optimal transmit beamforming problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> for the downlink multiuser multi-cellular network can be solved via a dual uplink channel in which the SINR constraints remain the same and the noise power is scaled by 𝛼 𝑖 . Mathematically, a Lagrangian dual of the optimization problem for the downlink ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) is the following uplink problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">minimize ∑ 𝑖,𝑗 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 𝜎 2 (6) subject to Λ 𝑖,𝑗 ≥ 𝛾 𝑖,𝑗</formula><p>where the minimization is over 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Λ 𝑖,𝑗 = max ŵi,j 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 | ŵ𝐻 i,j h i,i,j | 2 ∑ (𝑚,𝑙)∕ =(𝑖,𝑗) 𝜆 𝑚,𝑙 | ŵ𝐻 i,j h i,m,l | 2 + 𝛼 𝑖 || ŵi,j || 2 .</formula><p>The optimal ŵi,j has the interpretation of being the receiver beamformer of the dual uplink channel, and is a scaled version of the optimal w i,j . The optimal 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 has the interpretation of being the dual uplink power, and it corresponds to the dual variable associated with the SINR constraint of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</p><p>Proof: The proof hinges upon the fact that the SINR constraints can be reformulated as a second-order coneprogramming problem as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Therefore, strong duality holds for <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. This allows us to characterize the solution of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) via its Lagrangian:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">𝐿(w i,j , 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 ) = ∑ 𝑖,𝑗 𝛼 𝑖 w 𝐻 i,j w i,j - ∑ 𝑖,𝑗 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 [ |w 𝐻 i,j h i,i,j | 2 𝛾 𝑖,𝑗 - ∑ 𝑙∕ =𝑗 |w 𝐻 i,l h i,i,j | 2 - ∑ 𝑚∕ =𝑖,𝑛 |w 𝐻 m,n h m,i,j | 2 -𝜎 2 ]<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Rearranging <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, we get:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">𝐿(w i,j , 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 ) = ∑ 𝑖,𝑗 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 𝜎 2 + ∑ 𝑖,𝑗 w 𝐻 i,j [ 𝛼 𝑖 I- ( 1 + 1 𝛾 𝑖,𝑗 ) 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 h i,i,j h 𝐻 i,i,j + ∑ 𝑚,𝑛 𝜆 𝑚,𝑛 h i,m,n h 𝐻 i,m,n ] w i,j<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The dual objective is</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝑔(𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 ) = min w i,j 𝐿(w i,j , 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>It is easy to see that if 𝛼 𝑖 I -</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">( 1 + 1 𝛾𝑖,𝑗 ) 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 h i,i,j h 𝐻 i,i,j + ∑ 𝑚,𝑛 𝜆 𝑚,𝑛 h i,m,n h 𝐻 i,m</formula><p>,n is not a positive definite matrix, then there exists a set of w i,j that would make 𝑔(𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 ) = -∞.

It is also straightforward to introduce additional weighting factors to account for power consumption tradeoff at the per-antenna level. However, choosing the right weights is often not easy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Distributed Implementation</head><p>An important feature of the iterative function evaluation algorithms proposed in subsection IV-A and IV-B is that they can be implemented in a distributed fashion in a TDD system, where uplink and downlink channels are reciprocals of each other. In this case the virtual dual uplink is the real uplink.</p><p>Consider first the iterative function evaluation step of the algorithm. The function iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> on the uplink power 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 involves channel vectors h i,i,j within each cell only, which the base-station typically has the knowledge of, and the matrix Σ i . Observe that Σ i is essentially the covariance matrix of the received signal in the uplink direction at the base-station 𝑖, which includes the intended signal, the interference, and a scaled version of the background noise. In a TDD system, this covariance matrix may be estimated locally at each basestation in the uplink direction. Channel reciprocity implies that the signal and interference covariance matrices at the uplink receiver are exactly as required. In addition, the background noise level is typically known, so the scaling factor 𝛼 𝑖 can be easily compensated for. Thus, we can perform the iterative updates of 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 and the estimation of Σ 𝑖 on a per-cell basis, i.e. the iterative function evaluation process can be done locally without the need of explicit inter-base-station coordination. This uplink per-cell iteration process always converges. It converges to the optimal uplink power. Note that base-station coordination is achieved implicitly via uplink power control (i.e. the update of 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 's, which affect all other Σ i 's). The channel side information is needed only for users within each cell, and not for out-of-cell interferers.</p><p>Secondly, the beamforming vectors can also be easily obtained in the dual uplink. This is essentially receiver MMSE beamforming at the base-station.</p><p>Finally, to use the uplink beamformer for downlink transmission, one needs to scale it by the right 𝛿 𝑖,𝑗 . This involves a matrix inversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. But, this process is equivalent to a downlink power control problem on the effective matrix channel for achieving a desirable set of SINRs, which, by the classic result of Foschini and Miljanic <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, has a distributed implementation using a per-user power update algorithm. Each step of the algorithm sets a 𝛿 𝑖,𝑗 to satisfy its corresponding SINR constraint with equality assuming all other 𝛿 𝑖,𝑗 's are fixed. The convergence of the algorithm can be proved either using the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> or by a standard function argument <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>In fact, both the uplink per-cell iterative function evaluation and the downlink power control part of the algorithm can even be implemented asynchronously at each base-station using possibly outdated power information. The convergence of such asynchronous update is still guaranteed by the standard function argument as shown in Theorem 4 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The only necessary synchronization is that the base-stations must all be in the uplink phase or the downlink phase together, so that the three steps of the algorithm can be executed consecutively.</p><p>The above remarks are also applicable to the maximum perantenna power minimization problem. The only modifications are the projection operation on Q i , i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>, and the modification of the received covariance matrix (37) based on Q i , both of which can be done on a per-cell basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Beamformer-Power Iteration Algorithm</head><p>An alternative approach for solving the downlink beamforming problem is to iteratively update the beamformers and the power, as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. For the minimization of the total weighted transmitted power, the algorithm goes as follows:</p><p>1) Initialize ŵi,j ; 2) Find the 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 to satisfy the SINR constraints of (6) with equality; 3) Find the uplink receive beamformers based on the uplink power allocation 𝜆 𝑖,𝑗 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">ŵi,j = ⎛ ⎝ ∑ 𝑚,𝑙 𝜆 𝑚,𝑙 𝜎 2 h i,m,l h 𝐻 i,m,l + 𝜎 2 𝛼 𝑖 I ⎞ ⎠ -1 h i,i,j<label>(40) 4</label></formula><p>) Go to step 2 until convergence; 5) Update the transmit downlink beamformers</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">w i,j = √ 𝛿 𝑖,𝑗 ŵi,j<label>(41)</label></formula><p>The convergence of the iterations involving Steps 2 and 3 is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. By our multicell duality result, the algorithm must also converge to the global optimal solution for the downlink.</p><p>Both the iterative function evaluation algorithm and the beamformer-power iteration algorithm give the optimal solution for the multicell downlink beamforming problem. Both can be implemented directly in a TDD system. However, an implementation of the beamformer-power iteration algorithm requires repeated updates of uplink powers in Step 2 above, which would itself require either centralized processing (e.g. by performing a matrix inversion) or a separate iterative process (e.g. by fixed-point iteration). As both Steps 2 and 3 above need to be repeatedly executed by all users at the same time, the beamforming-power iteration algorithm would require a higher level of synchronization among all the users and all the base-stations than the iterative function evaluation algorithm proposed in the previous section.</p></div>

Intuitively, when the number of users per cell is small as compared to the number of base-station antennas, there are spare dimensions available for interference suppression. This is when coordinated beamforming shows the most benefit.</p><p>It is interesting to note that in the two-cell two-user-per-cell case, the conventional system eventually becomes infeasible as the SNR target increases. Yet, the coordinated beamforming system is always feasible. This is because the base-stations are equipped with four antennas. With a total of four users between the two cells, the coordinated system has the capability of zero-forcing the out-of-cell users, thus completely eliminating the out-of-cell interference. In contrast, out-ofcell interference is always present in the conventional system. Note that complete zero-forcing is no longer possible in the three-users-per-cell configuration. Nevertheless, coordinated beamforming still produces significant power saving. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> show the performance of coordinated beamforming in a 7-cell network with 3 randomly located users per cell (as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) under the minimum total transmit power and the minimum maximum antenna power criteria, respectively. Again, each base-station is equipped with 4 antennas. It is again observed that while the joint optimization algorithm outperforms the conventional per-cell update in the range of high SINR targets. This is due to the fact that at high SINRs, the multicell network becomes predominantly interference limited. The figures also show the dirty paper coding gain for both the joint optimization and the per-cell update algorithms. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> illustrates the power saving in the maximum antenna power by running the per-antenna optimization algorithm. For this 7-cell 3-user-per-cell case, the power saving is in the 1-2dB range.</p><p>To illustrate the convergence behavior of the proposed iterative evaluation algorithm, we compare it with the beamformerpower iterative algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the norm residue of the uplink transmitted power (in mW) versus the Total transmitted power versus the SINR targets for the joint optimization of a coordinated beamforming system and the per-cell update of a conventional system for two-cell network with two users per cell. One of the users are at various distances 𝑑 away from its own base-stations. The base-stations are equipped with four antennas.

The norm residue is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">𝑅 (𝑛) = 𝜎 2 ||Υ (𝑛) -Υ * || 2<label>(42)</label></formula><p>where Υ * represents the optimal power vector. It is observed that while the beamformer-power iterative algorithm converges more rapidly at the beginning, the distributed iterative function evaluation algorithm in fact provides faster convergence asymptotically. Note that for the distributed iterative function evaluation algorithm, each iteration step requires a covariance matrix estimation of the received signal at the base-stations. The algorithm convergence speed will therefore typically be affected by the accuracy of the estimation process, especially when channels change over time.</p><p>Finally, we note that the convergence speed of the iterative Total transmitted power versus the SINR targets for the joint optimization of a coordinated beamforming system and the per-cell update of a conventional system for a 7-cell network with 3 users per cell with and without dirty-paper coding. The base-stations are equipped with four antennas. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.

The base-stations are equipped with four antennas. function evaluation algorithm depends not only on the size of the problem (e.g. the number of antennas, the number of cells and the number of users per cell), but also on the SINR targets. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows the norm residue versus the number of iterations for different values of the SINR targets. It is observed that convergence becomes slower when the SINR target increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper provides a solution to the optimal coordinated downlink beamforming design problem for a multicell network with multiple users per cell. The uplink-downlink duality is generalized to the multicell case using the Lagrangian theory for two different design criteria: minimizing the total weighted transmitted power and minimizing the maximum antenna power subject to SINR constraints. An iterative function   evaluation based algorithm which is capable of finding the globally optimal coordinated beamformers is presented. A key feature of the algorithm is that it can be implemented in a distributed fashion for the TDD system. The proposed algorithm is efficient, and it outperforms conventional wireless systems with per-cell signal processing.</p></div>
