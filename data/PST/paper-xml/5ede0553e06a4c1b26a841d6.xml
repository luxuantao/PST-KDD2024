<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Inspired by progress in unsupervised representation learning for natural language, we examine whether similar models can learn useful representations for images. We train a sequence Transformer to auto-regressively predict pixels, without incorporating knowledge of the 2D input structure. Despite training on low-resolution ImageNet without labels, we find that a GPT-2 scale model learns strong image representations as measured by linear probing, fine-tuning, and low-data classification. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 96.3% accuracy with a linear probe, outperforming a supervised Wide ResNet, and 99.0% accuracy with full fine-tuning, matching the top supervised pretrained models.

Starting in the mid 2000's, approaches such as the Deep Belief Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hinton et al., 2006)</ref> and Denoising Autoencoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Vincent et al., 2008)</ref> were commonly used in neural networks for computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lee et al., 2009)</ref> and speech recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Mohamed et al., 2009)</ref>. It was believed that a model which learned the data distribution P (X) would also learn beneficial features for the subsequent supervised modeling of P (Y |X) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lasserre et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Erhan et al., 2010)</ref>. However, advancements such as piecewise linear activation functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Nair &amp; Hinton, 2010)</ref>, improved initializations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Glorot &amp; Bengio, 2010)</ref>, and normalization strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ioffe &amp; Szegedy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ba et al., 2016)</ref> removed the need for pre-training in order to achieve strong results.

The approach fell out of favor as the state of the art increasingly relied on directly encoding prior structure into the model and utilizing abundant supervised data to directly learn representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Krizhevsky et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Graves &amp; Jaitly, 2014)</ref>. Retrospective study of unsupervised pre-training demonstrated that it could even hurt performance in modern settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Paine et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Instead, unsupervised pre-training flourished in a different domain. After initial strong results for word vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>, it has pushed the state of the art forward in Natural Language Processing on most tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dai &amp; Le, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Peters et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Howard &amp; Ruder, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Radford et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Devlin et al., 2018)</ref>. Interestingly, the training objective of a dominant approach like BERT, the prediction of corrupted inputs, closely resembles that of the Denoising Autoencoder, which was originally developed for images.</p><p>As a higher dimensional, noisier, and more redundant modality than text, images are believed to be difficult for generative modeling. Here, self-supervised approaches designed to encourage the modeling of more global structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Doersch et al., 2015)</ref> have shown significant promise. A combination of new training objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Oord et al., 2018)</ref>, more recent architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gomez et al., 2017)</ref>, and increased model capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kolesnikov et al., 2019)</ref> has allowed these methods to achieve state of the art performance in low data settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hénaff et al., 2019)</ref> and sometimes even outperform supervised representations in transfer learning settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(He et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Misra &amp; van der Maaten, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Given that it has been a decade since the original wave of generative pre-training methods for images and considering their substantial impact in NLP, this class of methods is due for a modern re-examination and comparison with the recent progress of self-supervised methods. We re-evaluate generative pre-training on images and demonstrate that when using a flexible architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>, a tractable and efficient likelihood based training objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Larochelle &amp; Murray, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Oord et al., 2016)</ref>, and significant compute resources (1024 TPU cores), generative pre-training is competitive with other self-supervised approaches and learns Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. An overview of our approach. First, we pre-process raw images by resizing to a low resolution and reshaping into a 1D sequence. We then chose one of two pre-training objectives, auto-regressive next pixel prediction or masked pixel prediction. Finally, we evaluate the representations learned by these objectives with linear probes or fine-tuning.</p><p>representations that significantly improve the state of the art in low-resolution unsupervised representation learning settings. This is especially promising as our architecture uses a dense connectivity pattern which does not encode the 2D spatial structure of images yet is able to match and even outperform approaches which do. We report a set of experiments characterizing the performance of our approach on many datasets and in several different evaluation settings (low data, linear evaluation, full fine-tuning). We also conduct several experiments designed to better understand the achieved performance of these models. We investigate how representations are computed inside our model via the performance of linear probes as a function of model depth as well as studying how scaling the resolution and parameter count of the approach affects performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Approach</head><p>Our approach consists of a pre-training stage followed by a fine-tuning stage. In pre-training, we explore both the auto-regressive and BERT objectives. We also apply the sequence Transformer architecture to predict pixels instead of language tokens. One way to measure representation quality is to fine-tune for image classification. Fine-tuning adds a small classification head to the model, used to optimize a classification objective and adapts all weights. Pre-training can be viewed as a favorable initialization or as a regularizer when used in combination with early stopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Erhan et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Another approach for measuring representation quality uses the pre-trained model as a feature extractor. In particular, given labeled examples (X, Y ), the model is applied to X to produce features f X . Then, a linear classifier is trained on (f X , Y ). Linear probing captures the intuition that good features should linearly separate the classes of transfer tasks. Furthermore, linear probes help disentangle feature quality from model architecture: in fine-tuning, one model may outperform another because its architecture is more suited for the downstream task rather than because of better pretraining.</p><p>We begin this section by defining the auto-regressive and BERT objectives in the context of images. Next, we outline implementation details for our transformer decoder. Finally, we describe how the transformer is used for fine-tuning and how features are extracted for linear probes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Pre-training</head><p>Given an unlabeled dataset X consisting of high dimensional data x = (x 1 , ..., x n ), we can pick a permutation π of the set [1, n] and model the density p(x) auto-regressively as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(x) = n i=1 p(x πi |x π1 , ..., x πi−1 , θ)</formula><p>When working with images, we pick the identity permutation π i = i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, also known as raster order. We train our model by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the data:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L AR = E x∼X [− log p(x)]</formula><p>We also consider the BERT objective, which samples a sub-sequence M ⊂ [1, n] such that each index i independently has probability 0.15 of appearing in M . We call M the BERT mask, and we train our model by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the "masked" elements x M conditioned on the "unmasked" ones x [1,n]\M :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L BERT = E x∼X E M i∈M − log p x i |x [1,n]\M</formula><p>In pre-training, we pick one of L AR or L BERT and minimize the loss over our pre-training dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Architecture</head><p>The transformer decoder takes an input sequence x 1 , ..., x n of discrete tokens and produces a d-dimensional embedding for each position. The decoder is realized as a stack of L blocks, the l-th of which produces an intermediate embedding h l 1 , ..., h l n also of dimension d. We use the GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref> formulation of the transformer decoder block, which acts on an input tensor h l as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">n l = layer norm(h l ) a l = h l + multihead attention(n l ) h l+1 = a l + mlp(layer norm(a l ))</formula><p>In particular, layer norms precede both the attention and mlp operations, and all operations lie strictly on residual paths. We find that such a formulation allows us to scale the transformer with ease. The only mixing across sequence elements occurs in the attention operation, and to ensure proper conditioning when training the AR objective, we apply the standard upper triangular mask to the n×n matrix of attention logits. When using the BERT objective, no attention logit masking is required: after applying content embeddings to the input sequence, we zero out the positions in M .</p><p>Additionally, since we learn independent position embeddings for each sequence element, our BERT model has no positional inductive biases (i.e. it is permutation invariant). Put another way, any spatial relationships between positions must be learned by the model at train time. This is not entirely true for the AR model, as choosing the raster order also fixes a prespecified ordering of the conditionals. Nevertheless, permutation invariance is a property in strong contrast to convolutional neural networks, which incorporate the inductive bias that features should arise from spatially proximate elements.</p><p>Following the final transformer layer, we apply a layer norm n L = layer norm(h L ), and learn a projection from n L to logits parameterizing the conditional distributions at each sequence element. When training BERT, we simply ignore the logits at unmasked positions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Fine-tuning</head><p>When fine-tuning, we average pool n L across the sequence dimension to extract a d-dimensional vector of features per example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f L = n L i i</formula><p>We learn a projection from f L to class logits, which we use to minimize a cross entropy loss L CLF .</p><p>While fine-tuning on L CLF yields reasonable downstream performance, we find empirically that the joint objective</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L GEN + L CLF</formula><p>L GEN ∈ {L AR , L BERT } works even better. Similar findings were reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Radford et al. (2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Linear Probing</head><p>Extracting fixed features for linear probing follows a similar procedure to fine-tuning, except that average pooling is not always at the final layer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f l = n l i i</formula><p>where 0 ≤ l ≤ L. We will show in the experiments section that the best features often lie in the middle of the network.</p><p>As in fine-tuning, we project these intermediate features to produce class logits. Because we view the features as fixed when linear probing, this projection contains the only trainable weights, so we can only optimize L CLF .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>Although supervised pre-training is the dominant paradigm for image classification, curating large labeled image datasets is both expensive and time consuming. Instead of further scaling up labeling efforts, we can instead aspire to learn general purpose representations from the much larger set of available unlabeled images and fine-tune them for classification. We investigate this setting using Ima-geNet as a proxy for a large unlabeled corpus, and small classic labeled datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10) as proxies for downstream tasks.</p><p>Even in cases where labels are available, unsupervised or self-supervised pre-training can still provide benefits in data efficiency or on fine-tuning speed. We investigate this setting by pre-training on ImageNet without labels and then fine-tuning or linear probing with labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Dataset and Data Augmentation</head><p>We use the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 training dataset, splitting off 4% as our experimental validation set and report results on the ILSVRC 2012 validation set as our test set.</p><p>For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10, we split off 10% of the provided training set instead. We ignore the provided unlabeled examples in STL-10, which constitute a subset of ImageNet.</p><p>When pre-training or fine-tuning on ImageNet, we make use of lightweight data augmentation. First, we randomly resize the image such that the shorter sidelength is in the range <ref type="bibr">[256,</ref><ref type="bibr">384]</ref>. Next, we take a random 224 × 224 crop. When evaluating on ImageNet, we resize the image such that the shorter sidelength is 224, and use the single 224×224 center crop.</p><p>When full-network fine-tuning on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we use the augmentation popularized by Wide Residual Networks: 4 pixels are reflection padded on each side, and a 32 × 32 crop is randomly sampled from the padded image or its horizontal flip <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Zagoruyko &amp; Komodakis, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Once optimal hyperparameters are found, we fold our experimental validation set back into the training set, retrain the model, and report numbers on the respective test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Context Reduction</head><p>Because the memory requirements of the transformer decoder scale quadratically with context length when using dense attention, we must employ further techniques to reduce context length. If we naively trained a transformer on a sequence of length 224 2 × 3, our attention logits would be tens of thousands of times larger than those used in language models and even a single layer would not fit on a GPU. To deal with this, we first resize our image to a lower resolution, which we call the input resolution (IR). Our models have an IR of 32 2 × 3, 48 2 × 3, 96 2 × 3, or 192 2 × 3.</p><p>An IR of 32 2 × 3 is still quite computationally intensive.</p><p>While even lower IRs are tempting, prior work has demonstrated human performance on image classification begins to drop rapidly below this size <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Torralba et al., 2008)</ref>. When using an IR of 32 2 × 3 or 48 2 × 3, we instead further reduce context size by a factor of 3 by clustering (R, G, B) pixel values using k-means with k = 512. A similar approach was applied to spatial patches by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Ranzato et al. (2014)</ref>. We call the resulting context length (32 2 or 48 2 ) the model resolution (MR). Note that this reduction breaks permutation invariance of the color channels, but keeps the model spatially invariant.</p><p>To push performance on ImageNet linear probes, we also work with IRs of 96 2 × 3 or 192 2 × 3. Here, only clustering pixels produces a context that is still too large. Using a VQ-VAE (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Oord et al., 2017)</ref> with a latent grid size of 48 2 , we can downsample our images and stay at a MR of 48 2 . We choose a latent vocabulary size of 4096, the lowest size at which we do not observe reconstruction artifacts.</p><p>Our clustering of (R, G, B) values can also be interpreted as the training of a VQ-VAE with an identity encoder and decoder.</p><p>For the VQ-VAE architecture, we choose a small encoder and decoder pair (&lt; 1M parameters) to aid the sequence Transformer in modeling latent codes. Although downsampling with VQ-VAE destroys spatial permutation invariance, the receptive field for a latent code is only 16 × 16 for an IR of 96 2 × 3 and 34 × 34 for an IR of 192 2 × 3. Because the encoder is so small, information stays relatively local.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Model</head><p>Our largest model, iGPT-L, is essentially identical to GPT-2. Both models contain L = 48 layers, but we use an embedding size of d = 1536 (vs 1600), resulting in a slightly reduced parameter count (1.4B vs 1.5B). We use the same model code as GPT-2, except that we initialize weights in the layer-dependent fashion as in Sparse Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Child et al., 2019)</ref> and zero-initialize all projections producing logits.</p><p>We also train iGPT-M, a 455M parameter model with L = 36 and d = 1024 and iGPT-S, a 76M parameter model with L = 24 and d = 512 to study the effect of model capacity on representation quality in a generative model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Training</head><p>When pre-training, we use a batch size of 128 and train for 1000000 iterations using Adam with β 1 = 0.9 and β 2 = 0.95. We sequentially try the learning rates 0.01, 0.003, 0.001, 0.0003, ..., stopping at the first local minimum. The learning rate is warmed up for one epoch, and then decays to 0 following a cosine schedule. No dropout is used.</p><p>When fine-tuning, we use the same batch size and Adam hyperparameters. Here, we do not employ a cosine schedule, and early stop once we reach the maximum validation accuracy. Again, no dropout is used.</p><p>When running a linear probe on ImageNet, we follow recent literature and use SGD with momentum 0.9 and a high learning rate (we try the values 30, 10, 3, ... in the manner described above) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(He et al., 2019)</ref>. We train for 1000000 iterations with a cosine learning rate schedule. Finally, when running a linear probe on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, or STL-10, we use the L-BFGS algorithm for consistency with prior results <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Pedregosa et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments and Results</head><p>We begin with experiments and results from the autoregressive formulation of iGPT. Comparisons with the BERT formulation appear in Section 4.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">What Representation Works Best in a Generative</head><p>Model Without Latent Variables?</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Representation quality heavily depends on the layer from which we extract features. In contrast with supervised models, the best representations for these generative models lie in the middle of the network. We plot this unimodal dependence on depth showing linear probes on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10.</p><p>In supervised pre-training, representation quality tends to increase monotonically with depth, such that the best representations lie at the penultimate layer <ref type="bibr">(Zeiler &amp; Fergus, 2014)</ref>. Indeed, since a linear layer produces logits from prelogits, a high performing classifier necessarily achieves high accuracy on a linear probe of its pre-logits. If a downstream task also involves classification, it is empirically validated that penultimate features perform well.</p><p>With generative pre-training, it is not obvious whether a task like pixel prediction is relevant to image classification. This suggests that the penultimate layer of a model trained for pixel prediction might not produce the most useful representations for classification. Latent variable models such as VAEs can avoid this issue by explicitly learning a representation of the input data, but deep autoregressive generative models have the same width and connectivity pattern at every layer. Our first experiment studies how representation quality varies over one set of candidate representations: different layers of a generative model. We observe a very different behavior from supervised learning: representations first improve as a function of depth, and then, starting around the middle layer, begin to deteriorate until the penultimate layer (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>This behavior potentially suggests that these generative models operate in two phases. In the first phase, each position gathers information from its surrounding context in order to build a more global image representation. In the second phase, this contextualized input is used to solve the conditional next pixel prediction task. This could resemble the behavior of encoder-decoder architectures common across deep learning, but learned within a monolithic architecture via a pre-training objective.</p><p>Consequently, when evaluating a generative model with a linear probe, it is important to search for the best layer.</p><p>Taking the final layer on CIFAR-10 decreases performance by 2.4%, the difference between a baseline and a state-ofthe-art result. In all settings, we find that the dependence of representation quality on depth is strongly unimodal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Better Generative Models Learn Better Representations</head><p>Using the linear probe as a tool for measuring representation quality, we investigate whether better generative models (as measured by log-prob on held-out data) also learn better representations.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>, we see that as validation loss on the autoregressive objective decreases throughout training, linear probe accuracy increases as well. This trend holds across several model capacities, with higher capacity models achieving better validation losses. This highlights the importance of scale for our approach. Note that for a given validation loss value, bigger models also perform better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Linear Probes on CIFAR and STL-10</head><p>In addition to CIFAR-10, we also evaluate linear probes on CIFAR-100 and STL-10 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) to check whether the  For this evaluation setting, we achieve state-of-the-art across the entire spectrum of pre-training approaches (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). For example, on CIFAR-10, our model achieves 96.3%, outperforming both AMDIM-L (pre-trained on ImageNet without labels) and a ResNet-152 (pre-trained on ImageNet with labels). In fact, on all three datasets a linear classifier fit to the representations of iGPT-L outperforms the end-to-end supervised training of a WideResNet baseline.</p><p>Note that our model is trained at the same input resolution (IR) as CIFAR, whereas models trained at the standard Im-ageNet IR may experience distribution shock upon linear evaluation. As a counterpoint, though STL-10 has an IR of 96 2 × 3, we still outperform AMDIM-L when we downsample to 32 2 × 3 before linear probing. We also note that fine-tuning should allow models trained at high IR to adjust to low resolution input.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Linear Probes on ImageNet</head><p>Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in unsupervised and self-supervised learning on ImageNet, evaluated using linear probes on ImageNet. This is a particularly difficult setting for us, since we cannot efficiently train at the standard ImageNet input resolution (IR). Indeed, with a model resolution (MR) of 32 2 , we achieve only 60.3% bestlayer linear probe accuracy. As with CIFAR-10, scale is critical to our approach: iGPT-M achieves 54.5% accuracy and iGPT-S achieves 41.9% accuracy.</p><p>The first obvious optimization is to increase MR while staying within accelerator memory limits. With a MR of 48 2 , we achieve a best-layer accuracy of 65.2% using 1536 features. However, since contrastive methods report their best results on 8192 features, we would ideally evaluate iGPT with an embedding dimension 8192 for comparison. Training such a model is prohibitively expensive, so we instead concatenate features from multiple layers as an approximation. Our features tend to be correlated across layers, so we find that we need more of them to be competitive. If we concatenate features from 11 layers centered at the best single layer, we achieve an accuracy of 67.3% using 16896 features. Note that we achieve this accuracy both working at low resolution and without 2D structure.</p><p>To push performance even further, we use the VQ-VAE data preprocessing step described in section 3.2, sacrificing local spatial invariance. Interestingly, when training on an IR of 192 2 × 3 and a MR of 48 2 , the best-layer accuracy remains unchanged at 65.3%. However, the benefit of working with a higher IR is realized when we concatenate 11 layers centered at the best single layer, giving us an accuracy of 69.0%, competitive with recent contrastive learning approaches (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Because best-layer accuracy is insensitive to IR given a fixed MR, a finding also observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sandler et al. (2019)</ref>, we conjecture that training on longer contexts (larger MRs) will yield the largest improvements in linear probe accuracy. We also suspect that features from wider models will outperform concatenated layerwise features, which tend to be correlated in residual networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kornblith et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Full Fine-tuning</head><p>To achieve even higher accuracy on downstream tasks, we adapt the entire model for classification through fine-tuning. Building off of the previous analysis, we tried attaching the classification head to the layer with the best representations. Though this setup trains faster than one with the head attached at the end, the latter is able to leverage greater model depth and eventually outperforms.</p><p>On CIFAR-10, we achieve 99.0% accuracy and on CIFAR-100, we achieve 88.5% accuracy after fine-tuning. We outperform AutoAugment, the best supervised model on these datasets, though we do not use sophisticated data augmentation techniques. In fact, 99.0% ties GPipe, the best model which pre-trains using ImageNet labels.</p><p>On ImageNet, we achieve 66.3% accuracy after fine-tuning at MR 32 2 , a bump of 6% over linear probing. When finetuning at MR 48 2 , we achieve 72.6% accuracy, with a similar 7% bump over linear probing. However, our models still slightly underperform Isometric Neural Nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sandler et al., 2019)</ref>, which achieves 70.2% at an IR of 28 2 × 3.</p><p>Finally, as a baseline for ImageNet fine-tuning, we train the classification objective from a random initialization. At MR 48 2 , a model with tuned learning rate and dropout achieves 53.2% after 18 epochs, 19.4% worse than the pretrained model. Comparatively, the pre-trained model is much quicker to fine-tune, achieving the same 53.2% loss in roughly a single epoch.</p><p>When fine-tuning, it is important to search over learning rates again, as the optimal learning rate on the joint training objective is often an order of magnitude smaller than that for pre-training. We also tried regularizing with dropout, though we did not observe any clear benefits. It is easy to overfit the classification objective on small datasets, so we employ early stopping based on validation accuracy. Given the success of BERT in language, we train iGPT-L at an input resolution of 32 2 × 3 and a model resolution of 32 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). On CIFAR-10, we observe that linear probe accuracy at every layer is worse than that of the autoregressive model, with best-layer performance more than 1% lower. Best-layer accuracy on ImageNet is 6% lower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">BERT</head><p>However, during fine-tuning, BERT makes up much of this gap. A fully fine-tuned CIFAR-10 model achieves 98.6% accuracy, only 0.4% behind its auto-regressive counterpart, while a fully fine-tuned ImageNet model achieves 66.5%, slightly surpassing auto-regressive performance.</p><p>Finally, because inputs to the BERT model are masked at training time, we must also mask them at evaluation time to keep inputs in-distribution. This masking corruption may hinder the BERT model's ability to correctly predict image classes. Therefore, we also try an evaluation scheme where we sample 5 independent masks for each input and take the modal prediction, breaking ties at random. In this setting, CIFAR-10 results are largely unchanged, but on ImageNet, we gain almost 1% on our linear probes and fine-tunes.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Comparing performance on low-data CIFAR-10. By leveraging many unlabeled ImageNet images, iGPT-L is able to outperform methods such as Mean Teacher <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Tarvainen &amp; Valpola, 2017)</ref> and MixMatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berthelot et al., 2019)</ref> but still underperforms the state of the art methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Xie et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sohn et al., 2020)</ref>. Our approach to semi-supervised learning is very simple since we only fit a logistic regression classifier on iGPT-L's features without any data augmentation or fine-tuning -a significant difference from specially designed semi-supervised approaches. Other results reported from FixMatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sohn et al., 2020)</ref>. As inspiration, we note that humans are able to reliably recognize even novel concepts with a single example <ref type="bibr">(Carey and Bartlett 1978)</ref>. This motivates evaluating performance in a low-data regime as well. It is also a more realistic evaluation setting for the potential practical usefulness of an approach since it better matches the common real-world scenario of an abundance of raw data but a lack of labels.</p><p>In contrast with recent approaches for low-data classification, we do not make use of pseudo-labeling or data augmentation. Instead, we work directly on a subset of the raw supervised dataset, extracting features using our pre-trained model, and training a linear classifier on those features.</p><p>As is standard in the low-data setting, we sample 5 random subsets and report mean and standard deviation accuracies (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). On CIFAR-10, we find that with 4 labels per class, we achieve 73.2% accuracy outperforming MixMatch with much lower variance between runs and with 25 labels per class, we achieve 87.6% accuracy, though still significantly lower than the state of the art, FixMatch.</p><p>Although we have established that large models are necessary for producing good representations, large models are also difficult to fine-tune in the ultra-low data regime. Indeed, we find that iGPT-L quickly memorizes a 40-example training set and fails to generalize well, achieving only 42.1% accuracy. We expect adapting recent approaches to semi-supervised learning will help in this setting.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>Our results suggest that generative image modeling continues to be a promising route to learn high-quality unsupervised image representations. Simply predicting pixels learns state of the art representations for low resolution datasets.</p><p>In high resolution settings, our approach is also competitive with other self-supervised results on ImageNet.</p><p>However, our experiments also demonstrate several areas for improvement. We currently model low resolution inputs with self-attention. By comparison, most other selfsupervised results use CNN based encoders that easily work with high resolution images. It is not immediately obvious how to best bridge the gap between performant autoregressive and discriminative models. Additionally, we observed that our approach requires large models in order to learn high quality representations. iGPT-L has 2 to 3 times as many parameters as similarly performing models on Ima-geNet and uses more compute.</p><p>Although dense self-attention was a deliberate choice for this work due to it being domain agnostic and widely used in NLP, it becomes very memory and computationally expensive due to its quadratic scaling with sequence length. We mitigated this via the context reduction techniques discussed in section 3.2 but it is still a significant limitation. Future work could instead address this via architectural changes by exploring more efficient self-attention approaches. Several promising techniques have recently been developed such as local 2D relative attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bello et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ramachandran et al., 2019)</ref>, sparse attention patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Child et al., 2019)</ref>, locality sensitive hashing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kitaev et al., 2020)</ref>, and multiscale modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Menick &amp; Kalchbrenner, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, our results, considered together with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Donahue &amp; Simonyan (2019)</ref>, suggest revisiting the representation learning capabilities of other families of generative models such as flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dinh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kingma &amp; Dhariwal, 2018)</ref> and VAEs in order to study whether they show similarly competitive representation learning capabilities.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Experimental details</head><p>A.1. Hyperparameters</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, we present the learning rates used to train each model in the paper. When using too high a learning rate, we observe an irrecoverable loss spike early on in training. Conversely, with too low a learning rate, training is stable but loss improves slowly and eventually underperforms. As we increase model size, the irrecoverable loss spike occurs at even lower learning rates. This motivates our procedure of sequentially searching learning rates from large to small and explains why larger models use lower learning rates than smaller models at fixed input resolution.</p><p>We used an Adam β 2 of 0.95 instead of the default 0.999 because the latter causes loss spikes during training. We did not use weight decay because applying a small weight decay of 0.01 did not change representation quality.</p><p>On iGPT-S, we found small gains in representation quality from using float32 instead of float16, from untying the token embedding matrix and the matrix producing token logits, and from zero initializing the matrices producing token and class logits. We applied these settings to all models.</p><p>When training BERT models, one additional hyperparameter is the masking probability, set to 15% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Devlin et al. (2018)</ref>.</p><p>We also tried higher masking rates of 20%, 25%, 30%, and 35%, finding that 20% matched the performance of 15%, though higher probabilities decreased performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. VQ-VAE</head><p>Our VQ-VAE models largely follow the original approach in (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Oord et al., 2017)</ref>. Each encoder block consists of a downsampling convolution, ReLU, and a residual network. The decoder block mirrors this with a residual network, ReLU, and an upsampling transposed convolution. All resampling convolutions use stride 2 × 2 and kernel size 4 × 4. To get 48 2 MR from 96 2 × 3 IR, the encoder and decoder each use one of the blocks described above. For compressing 192 2 × 3 IR to 48 2 MR, two stacked blocks are needed. Our residual networks have the same architecture as the one in (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Oord et al., 2017)</ref>, but use 32 hidden units in the residual branch. For resampling convolutions and the VQ codebook, we use 64 channels.</p><p>While our autoencoders are tiny (fewer than 200K parameters), foreground reconstruction quality from our models is similar to that of much larger (40M parameter) autoencoders as long as a large codebook is used. In fact, we found that increasing the autoencoder size results in codes that are harder for the prior to compress. We use a vocab size of 4096, which puts more parameters (262K) in the VQ embeddings than the autoencoders themselves.</p><p>We experimented with L 1 and L 2 reconstruction losses, and found that L 2 reconstructs textures marginally better as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. After rescaling reconstruction and commitment losses to unit variance, we chose a commitment cost coefficient β 2 = 0.02 based on visual inspection of reconstructed images. We used Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kingma &amp; Ba, 2014)</ref> with a learning rate of 0.0001 to learn the autoencoder weights.</p><p>Following (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Oord et al., 2017)</ref>, we updated the codebook using an exponential moving average (EMA).</p><p>While EMA is fairly robust, we still observed a small degree of codebook collapse with a large vocabulary size.</p><p>To combat this, we considered a VQ code dead if its usage fell below 10% of its expected usage ((batch size) × (MR)/(codebook size)) = 128 × 48 2 /4096 = 72), and revived it to take on a value near a live code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Samples</head><p>Although our goal is not explicitly to produce high quality samples, training an auto-regressive objective gives us this capability. Note that we cannot use class conditioning to improve sample quality since we do not have access to labels during pre-training. Below, we show class-unconditional samples from iGPT-L with IR 32 2 × 3 (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) and with IR 96 2 × 3 (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</p></div>			</div>
