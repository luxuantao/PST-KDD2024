<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Personalized news recommendation has become a promising research direction as the Internet provides fast access to real-time information around the world. A variety of news recommender systems based on different strategies have been proposed to provide news personalization services for online news readers. However, little research work has been reported on utilizing the implicit ''social'' factors (i.e., the potential influential experts in news reading community) among news readers to facilitate news personalization. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of integrating content-based methods, collaborative filtering and information diffusion models by employing probabilistic matrix factorization techniques. We propose PRemiSE, a novel Personalized news Recommendation framework via implicit Social Experts, in which the opinions of potential influencers on virtual social networks extracted from implicit feedbacks are treated as auxiliary resources for recommendation. We evaluate and compare our proposed recommendation method with various baselines on a collection of news articles obtained from multiple popular news websites. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our method, particularly, on handling the so-called cold-start problem.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Recommending news stories in personalized web services has become a promising research direction with the development of Internet technologies for fast accessing real-time information around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Popular news portals, such as Google News <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>  1 and Yahoo! News, 2 have gained increasing attentions from a gigantic amount of online news readers. With the large volume of news events happening everyday, an important issue of online news reading services is how to help readers find interesting stories that maximally match their reading appetites, which is called personalized news recommendation.</p><p>In general, existing news recommender systems can be categorized into three groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Pure content-based methods (i.e., model users' reading preferences by the content of users' historical consumed news stories) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>, collaborative filtering (i.e., exploit user feedbacks without content analysis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> or hybrid version of several techniques (i.e., combining both content and user feedback to generate recommendations) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> are commonly implemented.</p><p>Unlike systems recommending other objects (i.e. products or movies), news recommender systems are unique in the sense that they have several exclusive properties. The item (usually news stories) universe is dynamic, each item within which is expected to have a short shelf life. The user feedback (usually user access history) is implicit, often described by binary ratings, where ''1'' indicates a click on a news story, while ''0'' indicates a non-click. Therefore, although previous studies are presented in many other domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, a couple of critical issues remain unsolved in news recommendations.</p><p>Firstly, how to overcome the data sparsity problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>? Many online users read limited news stories compared with the entire repository, and hence the access matrix is very sparse. Collaborative filtering is in particular very sensitive to sparse historical consumptions, since it cannot effectively capture users' access patterns. To address this problem, model-based collaborative filtering (i.e. matrix factorization, probabilistic matrix factorization) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> is most commonly adopted to reduce dimensions and consequently reduce the level of sparsity. However, how to handle implicit feedback by model-based collaborative filtering is still an open question <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The dynamic nature of news stories exacerbates the sparsity problem. Collaborative filtering methods are inefficient to group similar users whose historical consumptions hardly overlap in time. Pure content-based approaches are less likely to be affected by a high level of data sparsity, but they suffer from the overspecialization problem. Hybrid approaches, which alleviate drawback of individual recommendation strategy, provide solutions to data sparsity problem. However, since the content of news stories varies with time, it is not a trivial problem to detect common interest patterns by the aid of content analysis.</p><p>Secondly, how to deal with the cold-start problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, including the new user and the new item problems? The former is resulted from the fact that online user groups are evolving, whereas the latter is due to the dynamic nature of news stories. Collaborative filtering and the recent trend of social networking approaches (i.e. explore the potential of ''word of mouth'' in social trust network) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> are generally not applicable to new users and new items, unless they are pseudo ''new'', with a few ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For new users, many researchers turn to additional information (i.e. collect simple user profiles by requiring new users to fill out a list of questionnaires) for help <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. However, in questionnaire-based approaches, the process of requiring extra user inputs can be inhospitable and costly. In addition, the quality of user answers cannot be guaranteed. For new items, the content of item is usually helpful <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we study how to incorporate content information, user feedback and social network into a unified model to ameliorate both data sparsity and cold start problems, as well as enhance the overall recommendation efficiency. Intuitively, for sparse news reading data, the key issue is not to quantify the exact value of similarity within correlated user/item pairs, but to discover more correlated candidates from massive disjoint visiting records. Naturally, this could be achieved by two means. On one hand, we can manipulate the sparse access matrix into a denser usage probability matrix. In news reading systems, users prefer something new and timely. Therefore users' visiting records are disjoint because some reasonable clicks are ''missing'' when the stories are out-of-date. The probability of the ''missing'' click could be estimated, if proper units (e.g. named entities) are chosen to capture users' long-term interests. On the other hand, probabilistic matrix factorization reveals associations among user feedbacks. For the new item problem, it's more appropriate to recommend the new item to users who are interested in stories with similar content in the past. For new users, the ''expert'' opinions in the reading community may be good references for selecting stories. However, a list of real ''experts'' in the social network is usually not obtainable. Modeling the information flow patterns in the virtual social network where people unintentionally influence each other seems to be a good simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Inspired by the above mentioned intuitions, we propose PRemiSE, a novel Personalized news Recommendation framework via implicit Social Experts. We explore to predict ''missing'' clicks based on named entity preferences. Users' news reading interests are supposed to be a combination of several latent factors, which are inferred by estimating the maximal likelihood of observing the ''real'' and ''manipulated'' consumption history of each user, together with the content of each news story. In this way, the semantics of news stories and the structure of implicit user feedback are taken into account, leading to better recommendations to experienced users on existing news stories. For new items (stories), the content of stories is projected to latent factors. For new users without any (or enough) ratings and collaborations, stories are chosen based on the most influential users' reading choices on a virtual social network constructed from follow adoption relations among users.</p><p>In summary, the contribution of our proposed recommendation framework is threefold:</p><p>Capable of handling the cold-start problem: Collaborative filtering and content-based methods cannot predict ratings for new users due to the lack of rating data. We try to provide reasonable recommendations to new users by leveraging the opinions of implicit ''experts'', and thus enhance the capability of handling cold-start problem.</p><p>Semantically interpretable: By simultaneously modeling the observed ratings and word occurrences, our model can reveal the correlations between words and factors. Different from collaborative filtering in which the recommendation result is vague to explain, our approach is able to provide semantically interpretable recommendations.</p><p>Producing better news recommendations on sparse log data: Our model is specifically designed for sparse user access historical data. We pre-process on the sparse binary log data to produce a denser numerical rating matrix by predicting ''missed'' user-news access probability. And then by bridging ''word of mouth'' and ''users with similar tastes'', better performance on news recommendation is achieved.</p><p>This paper is an extension of our previous paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Distinguished contributions of this paper include the following points. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The original PRemiSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> model works with the sparse binary user-item matrix directly extracted from user log data. In this contribution, we argue that: news story is a natural choice as ''item'' in the recommendation framework, but it is not the best unit to represent user long-term preference on news events. A matrix manipulation method is presented, the ''real'' purchase is assigned a high rating, while ''missing'' usage probability is predicted based on user-entity preferences. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) Additional empirical study is implemented on large-scale data sets. The observations in the empirical study are utilized to guide a four-step social network construction framework. Then we formally define the expert model based on information diffusion theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> We carry out solid experiments on large-scale, real news recommendation data sets. The parameters are carefully justified. More comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods are conducted.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we briefly summarize and analyze recent research advances on news recommender systems. In Section 3, we present our PRemiSE model in detail, including the intuition, optimization algorithm inference, and matrix manipulation. In Section 4, we propose to derive potential experts from implicit social network. In Section 5, we compare our model with several baselines such as collaborative filtering, standard matrix factorization and LDAbased filtering, and justify the parameters included in our models. Finally we give our conclusion in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>Recently, recommending news articles or other document-format web objects has attracted more and more research attentions. Several adaptive news recommender systems, such as Google News and Yahoo! News, provide personalized news recommendation services for a substantial amount of online users. Existing news recommender systems can be roughly categorized into three different groups: content-based, collaborative filtering and hybrid methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Content-based recommenders</head><p>Content-based recommenders model news readers' reading preferences based on the text content of news items via bag-of-word model or topic models. Such representations are then used as the base to calculate the affinity score between newly-published news articles and the user preference profiles. Different content-based recommenders might adopt different similarity measurements to perform the calculation and then select top ranked news articles as the recommended result. Representative examples include <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Newsjunkie <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which filters news stories by formal measures of information novelty, shows how the techniques can be used to custom-tailor newsfeeds based on a user's reading history. YourNews <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> intends to increase the transparency of adapted news delivery by allowing users to adapt user profiles. Content-based methods are easy to implement; However, they are over-specialized to capture past news interest, while future reading behaviors of users cannot be precisely predicted.</p><p>Compared to collaborative filtering methods, content based methods are not very sensitive to data sparsity. Content based methods are incapable to learn interest profiles for new users who have little rating records. Furthermore, news recommendation quality highly depends on how the system deals with new item problem. When a user log into the system, she/he may prefer something new. But the traditional bag of word model and the topic model in content-based methods which solely analyze news stories are insufficient to represent news preference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Collaborative filtering</head><p>Collaborative filtering based systems assume that some intrinsic correlations exist among the reading behaviors of users, i.e., if two users are interested in the same topic, they would read similar news articles relevant to this topic. Based on this assumption, most collaborative filtering methods analyze the click behaviors of news readers instead of the news content. They are either neighbor based, by using a group of users ''similar'' to the given user to predict news ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>; or model based, by modeling users' behaviors and compute similarity between user and item factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>Alternatives of collaborative filtering methods are presented to alleviate the data sparsity problem, but they all have serious drawbacks. Higher order correlations are deduced instead of first order similarity in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. But the correctness of underlying assumption that similarity is transitive need to be further verified, and it is computationally costly for large scale data. Information granulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is employed to segment users by their gender, location, etc. This kind of approaches require additional user information, which is expensive to obtain and often inexact. Model based collaborative filtering, including matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (MF) and probabilistic matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> (PMF) have revealed to be superior in reducing dimension. They have been successfully applied in many other scenarios such as movie recommendation. Extensions of MF and PMF have been published on implicit feedbacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and k-nearest neighbors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> etc. However, these methods are still insufficient for very sparse data, especially when the item universe changes frequently. As for news reading, a user is likely to peruse news stories that happen recently, instead of old stories on her interest topic. Hence the user similarity which grounds model based collaborative filtering is inaccurate for users who have different active periods.</p><p>Collaborative filtering cannot effectively handle cold start problems on both new users and new items. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, factorized models by collaborate filtering are utilized to progressively design an initial interview process to profile new user. In addition, collaborative filtering in conjunction with content based methods and social recommendation are recently adopted to address new user and new item problems. We will discuss them in the next subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Hybrid recommenders</head><p>In practice, the reading behavior of a news reader can be related to not only the news content, but the reading behaviors of other news readers. Traditional hybrid recommenders <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> aim at combining both content filtering and collaborative filtering to provide more meaningful recommendation.</p><p>Recently, social media is becoming more and more popular in online communities. Social network structure in social media environments plays an important role for information sharing and diffusion. Result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> shows that the performance of personalized recommendation methods is strongly related to the behavior network structure. Based on such observations, researchers start a new direction of social recommendations, by modeling online readers' interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> and trust relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to derive the recommendation solution. Social recommendations are usually embedded in the framework of content-based or collaborative filtering. Here we consider social recommendations as another component of hybrid systems.</p><p>The combination can be implemented in various ways, which renders the hybrid solutions of recommendation more practical and effective. In the first manner, several methods are implemented separately, and predictions are merged. For example, the prediction in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> use weighted linear aggregation of a heat-spreading (HeatS) algorithm and probabilistic spreading algorithm. A topic category is learned for each article to predicted user interest content-wise, such a score is then multiplied with the collaborative score to generate final news recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In the second manner, the recommendation framework is content-based, with features derived from several methods. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, attributes used for profiling users and items are assigned weights estimated from a set of linear regression equations obtained from a social network graph. In the third manner, content-based and social characteristics are add to a collaborative filtering model. For example, fLDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> regularizes both user and item factors simultaneously through user features and the bag of words associated with each item. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> social and trust relations regularize rating matrix factorization. In the fourth manner, a new model is unified on content-based, collaborative and social characteristics. For example, a predictive bilinear regression model is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> based on all features in user and content profiles, extracted by content-based and collaborative filtering. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> performs a random walk model combining the trust-based and the collaborative filtering approach for recommendation. SCENE <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> performs a two-stage clustering on both contents and user access patterns.</p><p>Hybrid systems are more flexible to handle data sparsity and cold start problems. The sparse rating matrix is densified by predicting links on social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The inability of collaborative filtering to recommend news items is alleviated by combining it with content-based profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Another recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> shows that ratings on a new item, regardless of whether the rating is positive or negative, from influential users on the social influence network encourage others to consume the new item.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Summary</head><p>Our proposed model in this paper differs from existing works in the following aspects: (1) In previous works, real social networks (e.g., Epinion's trust network) are required. In this paper, hidden diffusion patterns are modeled on a virtual social network. We study the factors in constructing a virtual social network from users' access logs. We believe that our work can be applied to many other circumstances where a real social network is not readily available. (2) To the best of our knowledge, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> only applies a set of experts for recommendation. While ExpertsCF <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is a variation of collaborative filtering using ''true experts'' obtained from external data source, we automatically detect experts with powerful influence in the semantic community inside the data. And in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, experts are paid to comment on new items, the effect of experts really consuming the item is not studied. (3) We embed content-based, collaborative filtering and social networking approaches into a unified probabilistic framework, to produce predictions that balance the content of news, the reading preferences of users and the recommendations from ''experts''. We believe such a balanced prediction is consistent to the real decision making process in news consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PRemiSE</head><p>In this section, we first introduce the basic matrix factorization model. Then we describe how PRemiSE incorporates content and ''expert'' opinion with probabilistic rating factorization. We also derive the learning and inference algorithms for PRemiSE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Intuition</head><p>In basic matrix factorization models, user-item rating matrix is decomposed to user and item factors. Suppose users' preferences can be represented as K-dimensional vectors {U i }, i 2 1 $ M, each of which indicates how much the given user prefers the K underlying factors. Similarly, item coefficients in corresponding factors are denoted by {V j }, j 2 1 $ N. Basic matrix factorization models assume user-item rating is generated from the correlation of factors, i.e., ri;j $ U i V j . Since most recommendation systems preprocess ratings to be in the range of [0, 1], usually a monotonic function g(x) = 1/(1 + exp (Àx)) is adopted to project U i V j into the desired scale. A probabilistic expression of this intuition can be defined in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">pðr i;j jU i ; V j Þ ¼ N ri;j jgðU i V j Þ; r 2 r À Á :<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>Basic probabilistic matrix factorization models fall into the category of collaborative filtering, and thus it can automatically detect users with similar tastes and items with similar ratings; however, it cannot capture the diffusion of information from person to person. The so-called ''word of mouth'' is highly valued in marketing, because individuals tend to believe authorities when it comes to choice making. Suppose for a given user U i , we know a list of ''experts'' who have significant influences on him/her, then we can borrow the ''experts'' opinion to predict the given user's reading behavior. More details of expert modeling will be discussed in Section 4. We assume influence relationship between ''experts'' U e and user U i is denoted by q e,i .</p><p>Formally, the rating assigned from user U i to item V j is then drawn from several experts' opinions, i.e., ri;j $ P e re;j q e;i . Combining the two probabilistic generation processes, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">pðr i;j Þ ¼ N ri;j jg V j w 1 U i þ w 2 X e U e q e;i ! ! ; r 2 r ! ;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where the parameters w 1 and w 2 coordinate the effect of collaborative filtering and ''word of mouth'', subject to w 1 + w 2 = 1. Note that w 1 and w 2 are dynamic parameters. Intuitively, for experienced users, their preferences dominate their decision; while for unexperienced users, they are more likely to follow the experts.</p><p>The content of news also contains rich information. In general, word distribution is factor-dependent. Suppose H is the word space, where h w,k is the strength of word w correlating with factor k. We associate the TFIDF weighting of terms in each item profile with item factor and H. Probably each item j's profile wj is a Gaussian distribution whose mean is the product of item factors V and H, i.e., p ŵj</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V j ; H ¼ N ŵ g HV j À Á ; r 2 w ;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where U, V, H are zero-mean spherical Gaussian priors, i.e., pðHÞ ¼ P w;z N H w;z j0; r 2 w I À Á ; pðUÞ ¼ P i;z N U i;z j0; r u I 2 ; pðVÞ ¼ P j;z N V j;z j0; r v I 2 :</p><p>By combining collaborative filtering, ''word of mouth'' in social networks and content semantics, PRemiSE is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">User-item matrix manipulation</head><p>The PRemiSE model analyzes a user-item rating matrix. In the scenario of news recommendation, an ''item'' naturally refers to a ''news story''. However, there may be several problems arising in such a setting. For the first reason, a news story is not self-complete. There are several stories, one for each episode, to cover an entire news event. A story is not the best unit to capture user long-term interest. On the contrary, named entities are essential elements for every news stories. Named entities include when it happened, where it took place, what it was about, who was involved, and so on. Therefore named entities are fundamental to describe user preferences. Secondly, since we are to predict users' future news reading behavior, performing recommender systems on user-entity may cause inconvenience. Furthermore, in most news recommendation systems, there are no explicit ratings, but only implicit feedbacks, e.g. user-story access history. The value of implicit feedback is binary, e.g. if a user has visited a story then the value is ''1'', otherwise is ''0''. It would not be precise enough to distinguish user preferences. Finally, the user-story access matrix is very sparse, the user-entity matrix may be even sparser. Many stories are ''missed'' by their preferred users.</p><p>We here present a manipulated user-story matrix for PRemiSE model to work with. In the manipulated user-story matrix, a rating indicates the probability of usage. Hence a real purchase is considered to be an observed event. That is, the rating given by the user U i on story V j is r i,j = 1. In the meantime, we believe there are some ''missing'' ratings, which can be quantified from a probabilistic perspective, based on user preferences on named entities. Though the ''missing'' ratings are not real purchase records, they are reasonably deduced, and their values are smaller than real purchases. In this way, we can define and densify a numerical user-item matrix.</p><p>We start with extracting entity y l from each story. Each story contains multiple entities, while each entity may appear in several stories. Aggregated contents of associated stories for each entity as the entity profile for y l . Since in PremiSE model, the ratings are ranged within [0, 1], we assume the probability p(V j jU i ) of the unobserved purchase from user U i on story V j can be regarded as the ''missing'' rating. Assume entities are latent basic preference units, then the probability p(V j jU i ) of user U i choosing story V j is related to user preference p(y l jU i ) on every entity y l contained in V j , and association strength p(V j jy l ) between entity y l and story V j .</p><p>Suppose each entity may occur multiple times in a story. We define f(y l , V j ) is the frequency of entity y l in V j , the set of stories visited by user U i is denoted as V(i), and each story in V(i) may contain several entities, then U i has viewed a set of entities Y(i) = {y l jf(y l , V j ) &gt; 0,V j 2 V(i)}. Then p(V j jU i ) can be rewritten as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">pðV j jU i Þ ¼ X y l 2YðiÞ&amp;f ðy l ;V j Þ&gt;0 pðV j jy l Þpðy l jU i Þ<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>where pðy l ju i Þ ¼</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P Vo<label>2VðiÞ</label></formula><p>f ðy l ;VoÞ P y l 2YðiÞ</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P V o 2VðiÞ f ðy l ;V o Þ .</formula><p>The association strength pðV j jy l Þ is the probability of generating story V j from entity y l , which is a well studied computation problem in IR literature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Expert model</head><p>In Section 3, we demonstrate how to predict news rating by consulting to experts opinions. In practice, it is labor-consuming to manually obtain a list of verified experts. Therefore we propose a formal model to recognize implicit experts in the news reading community and to induce the ''influence power'' of detected candidate expert. Intuitively, ''expert'' is a reliable source to its ''fan'' for making decisions, and ''fan'' will frequently follow the consumption of the ''expert''. Although the follow-consuming relationship is not exactly the same as a real fan-expert relationship, this is usually the most common and explicit user-user relationship that can be extracted from news rating/access log, thus rendering our expert model more extensible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Empirical study</head><p>We perform empirical studies on a 11-day and a 2-months user access history of real news recommendation systems to study people's behavior patterns on accessing items in news reading community. As we discussed in Section 3, there are two kinds of unit items that express user preference: stories and named entities. Therefore we extract named entities from stories by GATE <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> in the two access history data. Details of the four data sets are described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We first study the distributions of stories and entities to investigate different characteristics of the two kinds of news items. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a), the visiting frequency of both stories and entities during two different time periods follow similar power-law distribution. The cumulative distribution of stories and entities with various life cycles (the number of days from first visit to last visit) are plot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b</ref>). We have the following observations. (1) A few very popular items dominant user attentions (tail of the line), each of which attracts more than 100 visits. The tails of the four lines are ''messy'', which suggests that accessing to very hot items cannot reflect the follow-consuming relationship among users. (2) A large amount of items (more than thousands) attracts a medium group of people (tens to hundreds). This phenomena suggests that these items may be personalized to a community of people sharing the same preference. (3) As the count of visits per item increases, the number of stories decreases faster than the number of entities. The portions of hot and rare entities are equivalent to the portions of hot and rare stories, but entities received median visits are more common. (4) Most items, including stories and entities, are active for 1 day. The number of permanent (length of life cycle equivalent to the time span) entities is greater than that of stories in both time span. Averagely, entities have longer life cycles than stories. Observations (3) and (4) support our assumption in Section 3 that entities reflect long-term interest.</p><p>Next we study the follow-consuming relationship. If user U i accesses to or rates an item V j after U e within a predefined time-window, then U i has a follow-consuming relationship with U e . By observing all users' consuming/rating data, we can obtain the average probability of a user accessing a news article in the next time-window given the number of its neighbors accessing the same article in the previous time-window.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a) and (b), the increasing curves indicate that a user is more likely to consume a news item if more people he/she had followed has accessed to it, which supports our assumption that users' reading behaviors depend on each other. For larger number of neighbors, the curves may not be monotonically increasing. This is because larger neighborhoods introduce noisy neighbors, which is highly consistent with the observation in most collaborative filtering studies. Further-more, we observe''S-shaped'' curve on all the four data sets used in our experiments. This is consistent to information diffusion theory, in which the probability of adopting behavior slowly grows for small numbers of neighbors k, rapidly grows for moderate values of k, and flattens beyond a certain point. These observations suggest that our formal expert model should (1) select ''experts'' based on how people follow their news adoptions and (2) consider the number of ''experts'' in producing recommendations.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a) and (b), we also notice that the time window size does not affect the increasing trend for smaller number of neighbors. However for larger number of neighbors, a wrong choice of time window size may cause negative effect. In the news domain, people would prefer to fetch news article one or two days after its publication. Therefore a relatively short time-window is reasonable. If we relax the restriction on the time-window size, the resulting follow-consuming relationship may be non-exclusive, thus introducing noisy neighbors. However, if the time-window is too small, it is possible that we cannot get enough neighbors for prediction. As shown from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(a) and (b), the maximal number of neighbors for any user increases as the time-window size increases. The maximal number of neighbors grows quickly for small time window size; when the time window reaches a certain size, the maximal number of neighbors retain a high value. These observations suggest that in the formal expert model, instead of considering all late adoption as in many social networking approaches, we should specify the appropriate size of time-window in which a following adoption occurs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Building implicit social network</head><p>The findings in the empirical study are helpful for building implicit social network from the temporal information of useritem access histories. The implicit social network consists of users and the follow-consuming relationships among them. The social network construction include four steps.</p><p>Step0: Suppose we have M users accessing to N items and their corresponding time-stamps, before the first step, we record the life cycle and number of visits for each item V j . By life cycle, we mean the total number of days from the first time to the last time V j being visited. By number of visits, we mean the total number of distinguishing users who have accessed to V j . Items which are visited only once are removed, since they do not affect information diffusion.</p><p>Step1: According to the visits and life cycle, abnormal items are removed by outlier detection approaches.</p><p>Step2: We then order each user U i on each remaining item V j by access time stamp T i,j . We assume that if user U t accessed V j after U s within a predefined time window, then the behavior of U t is potentially directly influenced by U s . The choice of a good time window size o should (1) preserve that we can find enough neighbors for each user and (2) ensure we can precisely find the right experts. The time window size is optimally tuned by empirical experiments. In this step, for all qualified tuples hU t , U s , V j i, where T t,j À T s,j &lt; o, we add an edge from U s to U t in the virtual social network. The weight of edge l s,t is the number of qualified tuples j{hU t , U s , V j i}j.  Step3: We select user pairs where the influence within each pair is statistically strong. Imagine we have Q edges for user U i with weight l 1,i , l i,2 , . . . , l Q,i where l e,i is the number of times U i accesses identical items directly after U e . Then each link is normalized by the in-degree Q of U i to project the amount of information diffusion to [0, 1] based upon U i . The resulting links with larger weights to U i suggest that out-nodes of these links have more influence on U i . We filter out links with weights smaller than a threshold l. Finally, we construct a graph G, where each node represents a user, and each edge from U e to U i is weighted by l e,i . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows a toy example of the implicit social network, in which the weight of each edge is annotated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Local expert and global expert</head><p>We consider ''global experts'' and ''local experts'' in our expert model. Intuitively, ''global experts'' are someone whose opinions are globally acknowledged, and hence a ''global expert'' can trigger a consumption trend. In the mean time, ''local experts'' are tailored for each individual. For an arbitrary user, ''local experts'' are someone who can inspire him/her, and therefore the user will be likely to follow the ''local expert''. In general, we seek to answer the following two questions:</p><p>How probably the given user will follow the expert's adoption on the same item? How probably any individual will follow the expert's adoption on the same item?</p><p>We use q e,i to denote the probability that user U i directly follows previous adoption by ''local expert'' U e . This can be obtained by modeling adoption follow patterns in the user social network. For each user U i , ''local experts'' are K adjacent nodes with largest q e;i ¼ l e;i P e 0 l e 0 ;i . Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, where a multi-step diffusion model with a shrinking parameter is proposed to simulate later adoption, we consider indirect influence. Intuitively, if U e influences U p , and U p influences U u , then U e indirectly influences U u , but the influence will lose its power in the long path.</p><p>Denote the shrink parameter as c, then S-step indirect influence can be modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">p S ðU u jU e Þ ¼ X t q u;t p SÀ1 ðU t jU e Þ:<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><p>Combining direct influence and maximal T-step indirect influence, we have:   For global experts, we consider a new user joining the community with random follow patterns, that is, the new node / links to every node with average weighting q /;U i ¼ 1=M. Then Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">12</ref>) can be employed for identifying global experts U e and influential power p(/jU e ). The local experts and global experts (maximal two steps) in our illustrative example social network is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">pðU u jU e Þ ¼ R T t 1 1 þ exp c p T ðU u jU e Þ:<label>ð12Þ</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Real-world dataset</head><p>The news data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is crawled from several popular news service web sites. It contains 2,015,479 visiting records during July to December 2010, from 1,192,435 distinguishing anonymous accounts to 55,418 different news stories. 52,680 Stories are provided with detailed information, e.g., news title, content, published time, etc. After removing stories with no content, there are 1,934,516 visiting records from users, ranging from September 16th, 2010 to December 16th, 2010.</p><p>In the experiment, news stories are formed by concatenating news title and news content, whereas named entities are extracted from news stories via information extraction tool GATE. We have extracted a total number 121,617 of entities. Averagely, each story has 21.75 entities. Some entities are associated to thousands of stories. A few examples of entity types appeared in our data sets are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>For evaluation purpose, we divide the entire news data into two disjoint sets, where the first one ranges from first day in the log to September 30th, 2010, and the remaining falls into the second set. In each data set, news stories associated with users' access histories of the last 3 days are extracted to serve as the test data, whereas the remaining is treated as the training data. The statistics of the two data sets is depicted in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Effect of manipulated matrix</head><p>In this subsection, we want to analyze the effect of manipulating the user-story matrix. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>, after processing the user-story matrix, the number of rating increases dramatically in both data sets. The sparsity of the data is therefore reduced to generate more similar user pairs. In order to see how this denser matrix can enhance customer satisfaction, we perform the simplest form of collaborative filtering. For each target user i that appear both in the test and training set, we pick K = 10 nearest neighbors, the predicted rating ri;j from user i to item j is derived from nearest neighbors' ratings on j, i.e., ri;j ¼</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">P K k simði; kÞr k;j P k simði; kÞ ;<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>where the similarity between user k and i is defined as the cosine similarity over ratings. Notice that some versions of the K nearest neighbor collaborative filtering only consider neighbors who have rated item j, e.g. r k,j -0. However, the values of training matrix before manipulation are binary, so we cannot filter nearest neighbors. Also note that to provide time-sensitive recommendation, we only consider stories happen within 30 days. Then we rank the items according to the predicted rating. The evaluation metric is F-Score at the top 30 recommendations. It can be calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall in the top 30 recommendations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">F 1 ¼ 2 Á Precision Á Recall Precision þ Recall :<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>where Precision is the ratio of stories user truly purchase within the 30 recommendations, and Recall is the ratio of stories user truly purchase within all user purchases. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>, the performance of simplest 10-NN CF is greatly enhanced on the manipulated matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Construction of networks</head><p>In order to investigate the feasibility of our ''expert'' model, we consider two types of elements for constructing implicit social graph: news stories and named entities. We then construct implicit social networks for two data sets using the two types of elements, respectively. Hence we can obtain four different data sets: Story79, Entity79, Story1012, Entity1012. The empirical study in Section 4 are based on the four data sets before network construction.</p><p>We first eliminate outlier items in step 1 by employing ELKI. 4 The parameter in ELKI is set to be 50. To determine the size of time-window o, we define a utility score u(o) as the average adoption probability achieved when considering most available effective neighbors. As we observe in Section 5, when the number of neighbors is small, the adoption probability quickly increases. So we heuristically define o as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">uðoÞ ¼ P K=2 k pðo; kÞ K=2<label>ð15Þ</label></formula><p>where K is the maximal number of available neighbors, p(o, k) is the average adoption probability per user given k neighbors adopting the same item within a time window size o. We compute utility score for the value of time-window size between {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and select the one with maximal utility score. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, in the story network, the best time window size is o = 8 days. In the entity network, the best time window size is o = 1 days. This suggests that entity network is more time-sensitive, thus may be more suitable for news recommendation. Accordingly, in step 2, we delete edges that are caused by a delayed co-consumption (9 days or even longer in the story network, 2 days or longer in the entity network).  In step 3, we normalize the edges weight, and empirically set the edge weight threshold l as 0.001, remove edges whose wights are less than l. Statistics of the generated diffusion networks for the four data sets is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Parameters of global expert model</head><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">12</ref>), the identification of global experts involves two parameters: the decreasing factor c, and the maximal number of steps T. To study the effect of these two parameters, we predict whether a new user will read an existing news story on data set 1. We generate global experts on the training set by different values of c and T. Then for each new user U new in the test set and each news story V old in the training set, compute a score based on opinions of 10 global experts by Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. We choose the top 30 news stories for each user, compute the precision and recall rate, where the precision rate is the percentage of news stories within the 30 recommendations that are accessed by the user in the test set; the recall rate is the fraction of the stories accessed by U new in the test set that are successfully included within 30 recommendations. We also randomly pick 30 stories for each new user, and compute the precision and recall rate, respectively. The ratio of the performance of global expert recommendation by different values of c and T to the mean performance in 100 random trials is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>.</p><p>Since global experts cannot provide personal recommendation to each new user, the differences over parameters are not significant. However, we can observe that the recall and precision are lower for smaller decreasing factor and larger step length. For computational simplicity, we set the maximal step length as T = 3, and decreasing factor as c = 2.0.</p></div>

In PRemiSE, the dynamic parameters w 1 , w 2 are set to be w 1 = 1, w 2 = 0 for users and items that appear in the training set, because after manipulation users and items in the training set have enough ratings.

Note that LDA-filtering is capable of predicting user's preference in new items. Our analysis shows that when predicting existing items for existing users, LDA-filtering is not better than MF. But it is superior in predicting new items for existing users. This suggests that in scenarios like news recommendation, the rich information contained in item profiles can be helpful.</p><p>PRemiSE performs best in all data sets. The best K is different among each data set. For example, in dataset1, the best performance is achieved when K = 20, and in dataset2 it is K = 100. This indicates that for more complex data set, the more factors are required to capture the semantic difference between each item.</p><p>The PRemiSE model with social network built upon stories is not as good as with social network built upon entities, but the difference is not significant. This verifies our assumption that entities, representing long-term news preference, are more effective in capturing follow-consuming relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Cold-start problem</head><p>We now look further on how different strategies work for cold-start problem. We test F-Score on dataset1 and dataset2 for four cases: recommend existing items (stories created within 30 days) to existing users (users exist in training set) to, recommend new stories to existing users, recommend old stories to new users, and recommend to new users new items. We abbreviate these four cases as oop, onp, nop, and nnp.</p><p>As mentioned above, MF, LDA-filtering and CF are not capable for handling all these cases. Our modifications are as follows: for onp, MF randomizes an item factor, and generates ratings from the user factor and the pseudo item factor; LDAfiltering inferences the topic distribution for the new item, and generates ratings as usual. For nop, MF randomizes a user factor, and generates ratings from the pseudo user factor and the item factor; LDA-filtering randomizes the topic distribution for the new user, and generates ratings by the pseudo user topics and the item topics. For nnp, MF and LDA-filtering give a random guess. CF uses the average rating for onp, nop and nnp.  F-Score performance of the four algorithms on cold start problems and all rating predictions are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>. We can observe that PRemiSE is comparative with LDA in recommending existing item and existing user, but outperforms MF and LDA-filtering in predicting cold start problems, including new users and new items. Again, the entity network is slightly better than the story network in finding global experts for recommendations to new users. Average rating is not suitable for cold start problems. This demonstrates the effectiveness of PRemiSE in handling the cold-start problem of news recommender systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">Semantics of factors</head><p>One advantage of PRemiSE, compared to other matrix factorization, is its semantic explainability. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>, we extract representative words for five factors in dataset1. The representative words are chosen from H, with the largest weight in each column. We also choose the top weighted words in five topics inferred by LDA. Then we manually identify these factors as ''entertainment'', ''news'', ''technology'', ''literature'' and ''economics''. Hence, the semantics of factors can help human understand the results of recommendation. We can see that PRemiSE and LDA are both semantically comprehensible.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and future work</head><p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of personalized news recommendation, and try to resolve some critical issues of this problem, e.g., the cold-start problem. To do so, we explore the potential relations among users in news reading community, and then formalize the community as an implicit social network, in which a couple of reading ''experts'' are identified whose opinions can be regarded as guidance for news recommendation to particular individuals, e.g., users without enough reading consumption history. Further, we integrate this ''expert'' model with the content information and collaborative filtering, and propose a hybrid recommendation framework, called PRemiSE. Besides better performance in terms of recommendation accuracy, our proposed system is also capable to effectively handle the cold-start problem; Further, the resulted recommendation list can be well explained via semantic information generalized in our method. Extensive empirical results on a collection of news data demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed system.</p><p>For future work, we plan to investigate the effect of ''experts'' in explicit social networks for personalized news recommendation. Since recently social media is becoming increasingly popular, and also a couple of studies have shown that in social networks the ''influencers'' have great impact on information diffusion. Therefore, it is possible that online users' reading behaviors might be affected by these ''influences''. It deserves to construct effective models for identifying influencers and formalizing the recommendation framework under the circumstance of social media.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Á 1 þ exp ÀV j w 1 U i þ w 2 X K k U i k q k;i ! ! !
