<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Quantum image processing (QIMP) is devoted to utilizing the quantum computing technologies to capture, manipulate, and recover quantum images in different formats and for different purposes. Logically, percolating this requires that representations to encode images based on the quantum mechanical composition of any potential quantum computing hardware be conjured. This paper gathers the current mainstream quantum image representations (QIRs) and discusses the advances made in the area. Some similarities, differences, and likely applications for some of the available QIRs are reviewed. We believe this compendium will provide the readership an overview of progress witnessed in the area of QIMP while also simulating further interest to pursue more advanced research in it.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Image processing is popular in our daily life because of the need to extract essential information from our 3D world. The nature of visual information, algorithm complexity, and the representation of 3D scenes in 2D spaces are all popular research topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>. Due to the rapid development of quantum computation and quantum information, notably Feynman's quantum computation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, Deutsch's quantum parallelism assertion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, Shor's integer factoring algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[80]</ref>, and Grover's database searching algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> in the past several decades, it is considered that the analysis of previously mentioned problems under the light of quantum computation and quantum information may result in new ways of understanding the nature of visual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>.</p><p>Quantum image processing (QIMP), an area focused on extending conventional image processing tasks and operations to the quantum computing framework, is the new sub-area that has emerged in that regard. The time line for this sub-discipline's development shows its modest beginning started in 2003, when Venegas-Andraca and Bose proposed the Qubit Lattice representation to encode quantum images <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>. This was closely followed by Latorre's Real Ket description for quantum images <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>. Years later, the third and final representation completing the trio, collectively regarded as the pioneers of the sub-discipline of QIMP, Le et al.'s FRQI (flexible representation for quantum images) was proposed in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref> and later reviewed in 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref>.</p><p>In fact, these pioneering representations and developments that followed them provide the essential proof that image processing on the quantum computing domain could speed up processing tasks, reduce the computational requirements, and facilitate the secure transmission by utilizing the characteristics of quantum computation and information, e.g., entanglement and parallelism.</p><p>Available literature on QIMP can be broadly classified into two groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. The first, which is referred to as quantum-inspired image processing, aims to exploit some of the properties responsible for the potency of quantum computing algorithms in order to improve some well-known classical or digital (i.e., conventional or non-quantum) image processing tasks and applications. Some of the available literature that fall under this group include: the work by Beach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which concentrated on showing that existing quantum computing algorithms (such as Grover's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>) are applicable to image processing tasks. In addition, the use of quantum computing and reverse emergence in classical image processing was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The key idea involved in this work is the use of cellular automata as a complex system and quantum inspired algorithms as a search strategy. The second group of the available literature in QIMP derives its inspiration from the expectation that quantum computing hardware will soon be physically realized and, hence, such research focuses on extending classical image processing tasks and applications to the quantum computing framework. Accordingly, such work is being referred to as classically inspired QIMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">107]</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the work by the trio of Venegas-Andraca, Latorre, and Le is credited with pioneering what is today regarded as QIMP. They provided the framework to formalize representations to capture and encode images on the quantum computing paradigm, the main requirements for which are simplicity and efficiency of the storage and effectiveness of the image retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38]</ref>.</p><p>In particular, Venegas-Andraca posited that if we assume an apparatus that could detect electromagnetic frequencies and produce a quantum state as output, we could store color in a qubit by translating given frequencies to quantum states. And by updating the indices to specify the pixels in the image, a full image could be stored in a Qubit Lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>. Following that, entangled images, in which geometric shapes are encoded in quantum states <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[95]</ref>; and Real Ket, where the images are quantum states having gray levels as coefficients of the states <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>, were proposed by Venegas-Andraca and Latorre, respectively. More recently, Le et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref> proposed a flexible representation of quantum image (FRQI), which is a normalized state that captures the essential information (i.e., its color and position) about every point in an image. It utilizes the idea of using the angle θ to represent the color information of an image as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>, and by using the two-dimensional position information (Y-axis and X-axis), the representation is more similar to the pixel representation for images on conventional computers. The FRQI representation maintains a normalized state and significantly decreases the number of qubits required to prepare images compared to the Qubit Lattice description. For example, the FRQI representation requires 2n + 1 qubits for representing a 2 n × 2 n image compared with n 2 qubits in Qubit Lattice model. In addition, it is a very flexible representation because it facilitates both the geometric and the color transformations on an image. Following its sturdy formulation, many of the available QIMP literature are either focused on its use, modification, extension, or applications as in quantum watermarking <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">122]</ref>, quantum movie <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33]</ref>, image database search <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">109]</ref>, or in many other applications such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">110]</ref>.</p><p>Inspired by the pioneering representations above, numerous other quantum image representations (QIRs) have been suggested. In terms of the QIMP time line, we call this group the recent QIRs. They include multi-channel representation for quantum images (MCQI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86]</ref>, the so-called Caraiman's QIR approach (presented as CQIR for brevity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>; novel enhanced quantum representation of digital image model (NEQR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[125]</ref>; quantum image representation for log-polar images (QUALPI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[126]</ref>; simple quantum representation of infrared images (SQR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[120]</ref>; color image representation utilizing two sets of quantum states for M colors and N coordinates, respectively (QSMC &amp; QSNC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>; and multi-dimensional image representation using a normal arbitrary quantum superposition state (NAQSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref>. These representations and their operations will be further introduced in the subsequent sections.</p><p>In terms of efficiency and resources for storage, these QIRs, basically, utilize similar strategies. The first step is the color storage, where an apparatus to convert the energy to an initialized qubit is needed (the apparatus acts like an injective function from the set of energy to the set of quantum states) <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>. This energy could be electromagnetic waves which can be detected and recorded, and then a magnetic field proportional to the stored frequency could be applied to a spin-half particle, which is originally prepared in either the spin-up or the spin-down state, wherein different quantum states for representing the color could be stored <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>. The energy could also be an infrared radiation where the energy values are in proportion to radiation intensity that can be measured with the number of received photons. In this way, radiation energy of objects is transformed into the required quantum state for storing color information <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[120]</ref>. It should be noted that as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>, this storage protocol allows us to store energy from all the spectrum (visible and invisible spectrum). The second step is storing an image in the QIR model. The apparatus we mentioned earlier can be an energy detector array with the size N 1 × N 2 , and we then update the indices according to the way visual information is made available to facilitate the storage of an entire quantum image.</p><p>The remainder of the review will be as follows: In Sect. 2, we briefly review the current QIRs as well as their relations by dividing them into three categories. In Sect. 3, we specialize the FRQI, MCQI, NEQR, CQIR, QUALPI, SQR, QSMC &amp; QSNC, and NAQSS representations and their features. The basic geometric, color, and frequency domain transformation of these QIRs is discussed in Sect. 4. The applications of aforementioned QIRs are reviewed in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6, we discuss the future developments of QIMP and offer a few concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Quantum image models</head><p>The objective of classically inspired QIMP or simply QIMP is to utilize the quantum computing technologies to capture, manipulate, and recover quantum images in different formats and for different purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. Based on the different requirements to capture the content of an image, we could divide the available QIRs into three models as discussed in the remainder of this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Image color model</head><p>This QIR model comprises of all three images that form the pioneer QIRs and the more recent ones. All of the QIRs in this group utilize the color model or visual difference to encode the content of an image. In their Qubit Lattice QIR, Venegas-Andraca and Bose <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref> averred that frequency of the physical nature of color could represent a color instead of the traditional color models, e.g., RGB model or the HIS model, so a color could be represented by one qubit in the quantum computing system <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>. Similarly, all the other QIRs in this model are built on the chromatic content of the image. Typically, the QIRs in this model could be further grouped as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• Binary-based QIR • Grayscale-based QIR • RGB-based QIR • Infrared image-based QIR</formula><p>QIR research has witnessed a similar evolution with the classical image representation: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[95]</ref>, the entangled image state was proposed for storing and retrieving binary geometrical shapes in quantum mechanical systems. It harnesses the entangled state to express the realization of some certain pixels so that the object shapes could be reconstructed without any use of auxiliary information. The binary-based QIR in <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[95]</ref> is a simple representation and easy to discuss the storage, retrieval, and related operations, e.g., it is always used in digital image processing as masks or as the result of certain operations such as segmentation, thresholding, and dithering. However, the limitation of the simple color representation [actually, black (0) for the foreground color and white (1) for the background color of the image] provides enough evidence that a more complex color model is needed to focus on the geometric and chromatic details in the image.</p><p>Instead of merely describing the outline of some objects in an image by using binary encodes (0 and 1), more levels to express color, i.e., grayscale information, are needed to indicate more color details. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>, a flexible representation for quantum images, FRQI, was proposed to integrate the grayscale color and position information about an image into a normalized state that facilitates the geometric and color transformations on the image. A single qubit is dedicated for encoding color information, thereby ensuring that transformations on the image content can target the color only or both the color and position simultaneously. Specified quantum gates applied on predetermined areas of the image could transform the color information as desired.</p><p>In order to effectively mimic the human perception of visual effects, a true color image with three primary colors R, G, and B, is a natural extension in QIMP area. Color image representations either utilize two sets of quantum states, to respectively represent M different colors and N pixels in an image <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>, or use different level of angles for RGB information and the tensor product with location information (Yaxis and X-axis) to represent an image <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">114]</ref>. They are different from the only simple color operations that can be performed on the quantum image encoded in FRQI representation (because of the fact that only a single qubit is used to represent the color information for each pixel), and the RGB-based QIRs can separate the image into not only its R, G, and B components but also an additional α channel, which helps facilitate additional operations on the image's content as in the multi-channel quantum images MCQI in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86]</ref>, an extension of FRQI representation, that could operate on the color of interest (CoI), color swapping (CS), and α blending (αB) transformations which will be reviewed in Sect. 3.2. While in QSMC &amp; QSNC <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>, it uses two sets of quantum states for M colors and N coordinates, respectively, which could both represent grayscale and color information of an image, and in addition, it could provide a lossless compression with acceptable compression ratios and a quantum search-based image segmentation method that is universal for grayscale images and color images.</p><p>The last type of QIR that completes the color model is the representation for infrared quantum images, which differs from the other types described so far in that it is a result of thermal-based image in infrared imaging system with its visual capacity in darkness and fog; it can almost work in any environment and all weather conditions. Therefore, infrared image processing has a wide range of applications in satellite sensing, weapon navigation, meteorological monitoring, and environmental pollution supervision, etc. Inspired by the idea of producing quantum states from certain frequencies and using the angle parameter of a qubit to store a color as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>, probability of projection measurement is used to store the radiation energy value of each pixel in a simple quantum representation for infrared images, i.e., SQR <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[120]</ref>. SQR provides more processing operations than Qubit Lattice model and exhibits a quadratic decrease in quantum gates used in the image preparation procedure compared with FRQI representation. In addition, the processing operations, such as global operations (GO) and local operations (LO), could be performed on the SQR representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[120]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Image coordinate model</head><p>In this subsection, we focus on QIRs that utilize different coordinate systems to capture the information about an image. Some of the available QIRs that fall under this model include:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• Cartesian coordinate system-based QIR • Log-polar coordinate system-based QIR • Multi-dimension-based QIR</formula><p>The typical example of a coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system. In the two-dimensional plane, two perpendicular lines are chosen and the coordinates of a point are taken to be the signed distances to the lines. We always describe the physical and mathematical model on the Cartesian coordinate system. The quantum image representation is also originated from the basic Cartesian coordinate in order to satisfy human's senses to the nature by presenting the content of an image on the plane. The pioneer QIRs, e.g., Qubit Lattice, which maps every pixel to a single qubit and the images are stored in two-dimensional arrays of qubits without using any preprocessing step <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>, and the Real Ket, which utilizes the coefficients of a basis state of a qubit sequence to represent the grayscale value of every pixel and stores an image into a quantum superposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>, could both be described as QIRs processed on the basis of two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate systems that are intuitionistic, and most importantly, they facilitate the basic geometric transformations on an image due to their special coordinate structure. For example, the third pioneering QIR, the FRQI representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>, falls also under the Cartesian coordinate system; the twopoint swapping, flip, coordinate swapping, orthogonal rotation, and their variants for quantum images have been fully studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55]</ref>.</p><p>Image representations on different coordinate systems oftentimes yield different operations and applications. In the earlier discussion on QIRs based on the image coordinate model, many complex affine transformations cannot be easily performed because a lot of irreversible interpolations are needed. In the field of classical image processing, log-polar coordinates are widely employed as sampling methods where the sampling resolutions of the log-radius and the angular orientations are assumed to be 2 m and 2 n in a 2 m × 2 n sized log-polar image, respectively. A quantum log-polar image, QUALPI, was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[126]</ref> for storing and processing images sampled in log-polar coordinates. Complex geometric transformations can be performed based on QUALPI, e.g., symmetry transformation including quantum centrosymmetry and quantum axisymmetry could be efficiently performed, and the rotation transformation by shifting the angular directions is lossless and reversible because there is no interpolation operation. In addition, a fast rotation-invariant quantum image registration algorithm was designed for log-polar images, using which the exact rotation difference between two quantum images can be found out. The relationship between these two kinds of two-dimensional image sampling methods (the coordinate transformation between Cartesian coordinate system-based and Log-polar coordinate system-based images) is also presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[126]</ref>.</p><p>In our 3D world, 3-dimensional description of objects (3D images) could always provide us with an intuitive impression. In the mathematical and physical con-texts, we even discuss some problems or build some models in multi-dimensional Cartesian systems using n-dimensional Euclidean spaces. A new representation for multi-dimensional color image, NAQSS, was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60]</ref>, where the position information of an image expanded to k binary arrays in k coordinates in the k-dimensional space was broached. The NAQSS requires n + 1 qubits, where n qubits represent colors and coordinates of 2 n pixels and 1 qubit represents an image segmentation information to improve the accuracy of image segmentation, while only the image (not including additional segmentation information) is represented by n + 1 qubits in FRQI representation. In addition, due to the bijective function between color and angle, it has no constraints in terms of the color representation (it can both represent the grayscale and RGB images by adjusting the bijective function).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Image color information encoding model</head><p>Finally, similar to the different classical image file formats, e.g., BMP, TIFF, and JPEG, the two fundamental information, i.e., color and position, of an image could be encoded in different approaches. Considering this, we divide the QIRs under the color information encoding model into two categories:</p><p>• Encoded using one qubit through the angle parameter of it • Encoded in the basis states of a sequence of qubits In the first category, we see some of the pioneer QIRs, and the representation models encode the color information in the state of one qubit by establishing a bijective relationship between the frequency of the monochromatic electromagnetic wave that determines the color and the angle parameter of a qubit such as Qubit Lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref>, FRQI <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>, and QSMC &amp; QSNC <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>. Even though the pixel position encoding of them varies each other among these three representations, e.g., no explicit quantum encoding of the position information in Qubit Lattice model, the position information of every pixel can be stored in a basis state of a 2n qubit sequence in FRQI representation, and the position information can be encoded in the angle parameter of a qubit by creating a bijection between the set of pixel coordinates and a set of angles in QSMC &amp; QSNC method. It should be noted that in this classification, the original classical image cannot be accurately retrieved notwithstanding a finite number of measurements. This is because the quantum measurements only provide probabilistic results of the color angle <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>. Therefore, multiple copies of the same quantum image are required to be prepared, following which a statistical procedure is applied according to the sampling theory in order to estimate the probability amplitudes of the quantum states encoding the color of each pixel within a given accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>With the development, the CQIR in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and NEQR in <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[125]</ref> were simultaneously and independently proposed. In both QIRs, the color information is encoded in the basis states of a sequence of qubits so that the whole image is stored in the superposition of the two qubit sequences. This is the second category that we discussed earlier. Assume m qubits are used to encode all possible gray levels presented in the image which means the color model C is an m-qubit register. In this category, both the color and position of a pixel in the image are encoded in the basic quantum states (instead of the superposition state with the complex numbers as the coefficients); therefore, both the color and position information in this representation can be possibly retrieved deterministically through a finite number of projective measurements. In addition, the number of representable colors and positions in an image does not depend on the actual physical implementation of the quantum system, and a larger class of more complex image processing operations can be applied using this model because the color is represented using a computational basis state that can act as control for applying value-dependent color transforms and for computing statistics in the image according to Caraiman addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, due to the complex representation, additional qubits are needed to encode the color information of this kind of images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Quantum image representations and features</head><p>As mentioned earlier, the FRQI representation has a widespread appeal in the QIMP literature over the last five years. In this section, we introduce this representation and highlight some of its properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">54]</ref>. Later, we review some recent QIRs which are broached each with one operation or the other in mind by modifying and/or extending aspects of the pioneering QIRs. To make our review self-contained, we adopt the formalization and description in the literatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">120,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">126]</ref> to elaborate these QIRs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">FRQI representation and its features</head><p>FRQI, flexible representation for quantum images, is similar to the pixel representation for images on traditional computers. It captures the essential information about the colors as well as the corresponding positions of every point in an image and integrates them into a quantum state having its formula in Eq. (1) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">|I = 1 2 n 2 2n -1 i=0 |c i ⊗ |i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">|c i = cos θ i |0 + sin θ i |1 , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where |0 and |1 are 2D computational basis quantum states, |i , i = 1, 2,…, 2 2n -1, are 2n-D computational basis quantum states and θ</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= (θ 0 , θ 1 , . . . , θ 2 2n -1 ), θ i ∈ [0, π/2],</formula><p>is the vector of angles encoding colors. There are two parts in the FRQI representation of an image: |c i and |i which encode information about the colors and corresponding positions in the image, respectively. An example of a 2 × 2 FRQI quantum image with its quantum state is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In quantum computation, computers are usually initialized in well-prepared states <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>.

An example of a 2 × 2 MCQI quantum image with its quantum state is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>As discussed earlier, the MCQI representation leads consequently to the following major advantages: -MCQI representation provides a solution to encoding R, G, and B channel information in normalized quantum states using many fewer qubits. Such a merit originates because in the MCQI representation, the property of quantum parallelism is utilized to encode the color information and their corresponding positions. This results in MCQI quantum images requiring far fewer qubits than the Qubit Lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[96]</ref> and also significantly less computing resources than the same-sized classical RGB image. -Using MCQI makes it easier to design color image operators with much lower complexity. Color information operators applied to the whole MCQI quantum image are designed by using unitary quantum gates within these 3 color qubits irrespective of position qubits. This means that the complexity of MCQI-based color information operators is image size-independent, whereas color information must be shifted pixel by pixel when executing similar operations on classical computers.</p><p>-MCQI representation provides the potential to design quantum cryptography-based color image watermarking algorithms. Combined with the quantum measurementbased key generation procedure, MCQI may be used to design the color image watermarking algorithms, which will be reviewed in Sect. 5.2.</p><p>An MCQI quantum image is stored in the preparation process using the MC-PPT theorem that extends the vector in Theorem 1 to three vectors of angles <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86]</ref>. MCQI representation shares the same method with FRQI to encode position information, i.e., the same arrangement for position qubits. The notable difference between the two representations is color qubits because FRQI uses 1 qubit to encode an image color, whereas MCQI applies 3 qubits to carry multi-channel color information. An improved version of MCQI, color quantum image based on phase transform (CQIPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[85]</ref>, was proposed where the color information is prepared by controlled phase gates which are especially flexible for many image processing and security algorithms based on phase encoding.</p></div>

These QIRs are summarized in the sequel.</p><p>The NEQR representation uses two entangled qubit sequences to store the whole image, and in this manner, it reduces the time complexity and provides more accurate information retrieval and more complex operations compared to FRQI. Similar to NEQR, the basis states of a sequence of qubits are used to represent the color information, but different number of qubits with different gray levels to encode the color information of an image in CQIR so that different processing operations could be performed. The multi-channel representation for quantum images, MCQI, proposed by Sun et al. is an extension of the FRQI representation that facilitates more advanced color image processing by applying different operations on the R, G, and B channels of the image. While also for representing the color information, QSMC &amp; QSNC chose to employ two bijective functions from color and coordinate to angles for representing the color and position information so that compression and segmentation likely operations could be well performed. Finally, three special quantum image representations are concluded here. QUALPI on its part is a representation that exhibits the image in log-polar coordinate. In this way, the affine transformations such as rotation and scaling could be easily performed. In addition, SQR is a representation for infrared quantum images where the color information (a quantum state) is produced from infrared radiation energy that could improve the visual capacity in almost any environment. Last, NAQSS, where the usual position notation/information i is divided into k binary expansions for representing a coordinate (v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k ) in the k-dimensional space V, was proposed to satisfy the image processing research in multi-dimensional space.</p><p>At the end, we present the features including their equations, the color information encoding strategies, the computational complexities for preparing these quantum images, and the measurement-based retrievals on them among aforementioned QIRs as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>

Symmetry transformation is a kind of important geometric transformation including centrosymmetry and axisymmetry. Rotation is a common geometric transformation of images sampled in the log-polar coordinates. Different from the images sampled in Cartesian coordinates, rotation transformation of a log-polar image is lossless and reversible because there is no interpolation operation.

It allows for an accurate retrieval of the segmented image using a finite number of quantum measurement operations.</p><p>(3) Registration Image registration is the process of transforming different sets of images (the same scene or object that may be from different sensors, times, depths, or viewpoints) into one coordinate system. Even though some quantum-inspired registration methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">91]</ref> have been proposed, it is still rarely touched in QIMP. Due to the special properties of log-polar coordinate, a fast rotation-invariant quantum image registration algorithm was proposed based on the QUALPI quantum image model <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[126]</ref>. This quantum algorithm comprises four steps: quantum image preparation, quantum image expanding, quantum image searching, and quantum measurement. It achieves a quartic speedup compared with most of the classical image registration methods. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">4</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>) Morphology</head><p>Morphology is an approach for analyzing and processing the geometrical structures of digital images. Dilation (the object of an image "grows" or "thickens") and erosion (the object of an image "shrinks" or "thins") are fundamental to morphological operations. Yuan et al. proposed a quantum morphology operations based on NEQR representation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[119]</ref>. Quantum binary dilation and erosion operations can be realized based on AND, OR, and NOT logic operations supplemented by quantum measurement operations. In addition, Yuan et al. also provide the design of flat grayscale dilation and erosion operations, where quantum bit string comparator <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref> is used as an oracle in Grover's search algorithm. Later, Zhou et al. uses the quantum loading scheme (QLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">70]</ref> and Boyer algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to build the quantum dilation and erosion algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[128]</ref>. They claimed that the time complexity of both the dilation and erosion algorithm is O( √ M N ), which is much smaller than the classical method for the quantum computing parallelism.</p><p>(5) Pseudocolor</p><p>Pseudocolor processing dyes grayscale images to color images to make the images more beautiful or to highlight some parts on the images. Jiang et al. proposed a quantum image pseudocolor coding scheme based on the density-stratified method <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. A quantum colormap representation (QCR) is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>, which uses q +t normalized qubits to store a colormap with 2 t colors. The color depth of each color is 2 q . The preparation and retrieving of QCR with their quantum circuits were also discussed there. The main advantages of the quantum version for pseudocolor processing over the classical approach are that it needs less memory and can speed up the computation. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">6</ref>) Filtering</p><p>Image filtering aims to suppress the noise without losing the details and features in an image, which is an indispensable operation in image preprocessing. Caraiman et al. described a method to achieve the filtering of a quantum image encoded in CQIR by exploiting QFT and the principle of the quantum oracle in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. It is a common approach to convolve the image with a filter function, which in the frequency domain translates into a multiplication operation. It should be noted that there are fundamental differences between classical and quantum operations, the latter being necessarily invertible due to the reversible nature of quantum computation. Therefore, some classical processing operations, such as convolution and correlation, cannot be directly applied to quantum images <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Denoising</p><p>Denoising is a process of removing noise from an image for aesthetic or practical purposes. Mastriani proposed a quantum Boolean image processing methodology in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref>, where two new interfaces, i.e., classical to quantum and quantum to classical, are built to facilitate the boolean image denoising in quantum computing domain. By utilizing the quantum Boolean mean filter, the algorithm replaces central pixel value of a portion of the quantum boolean image affected by the selection mask. Meanwhile, color decomposition/recomposition and bit slicing/reassembling are considered for the preparation and completion of this procedure. (8) Scrambling Image scrambling, a technique widely used to transform an image into a disordered image, has been extensively studied. The popular traditional image scrambling algorithms, i.e., Hilbert transform, Arnold transform, and Fibonacci transform, are extended to the QIMP. The Arnold and Fibonacci scrambling quantum circuits in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref> take advantage of the plain adder and adder modulo N by modifying operations on the input and output in order to scramble the images, while the Hilbert scrambling quantum circuit in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> is executed by using Hilbert Scanning Matrix that is generated by a recursive generation algorithm. Most of the existing quantum image scrambling schemes are basically position space scrambling strategies. However, Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[130]</ref> proposed a quantum image gray-code and bit-plane scrambling scheme based on NEQR representations. They reported that the scheme's cost is rather low, and the scrambling speed is very high compared with other quantum image scrambling like the quantum Hilbert scrambling <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>.</p><p>At the end of this subsection, we provide some quantum-inspired image processing methods (processing the classical image by utilizing the quantum mechanics and properties). We refer interested readers to more detailed discussions on image denoising in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, image information hiding in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">76]</ref>, image segmentation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">118]</ref>, edge detection in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">103]</ref>, image compression in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">72]</ref>, and image registration in <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">91]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Quantum image security technologies</head><p>Traditional image security techniques, such as digital watermarking and image encryption, are widely used for effective protection of digital images. Digital watermarking is utilized to embed some watermark information into the carrier image. Such a strategy, however, should not change the visual acuity of the carrier image <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">111]</ref>. This application is very important for the authentication of the copyright in entertainment industry. Additionally, image encryption offers a medium to translate the original image into a meaningless image (where visual acuity is lost) and become the information similar to the channel random noise. This is significant for some special communication applications such as secure transmission of military satellite images and patients' records when they are sent across the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">123]</ref>. In the remainder of this subsection, we will review some pioneering efforts for quantum image security applications, notably quantum image watermarking, steganography, and encryption strategies.</p><p>In 2010, Iliyasu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> pioneered what is today widely regarded as quantum image watermarking with the proposal of the WaQI scheme (watermarking and authentication strategy for quantum images based on restricted geometric transformations). The enhanced WaQI strategy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> is secure, keyless, blind, and computationally efficient, and can be perfectly used to authenticate the identity of an image owner. Subsequently, its two-tier grayscale version, or simply GWaQI scheme, was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref> that includes embedding a conspicuous watermark logo in a predetermined sub-area of the cover image; meanwhile, the same watermark signal is embedded to cover the rest of the image in an obscure manner. Although the WaQI scheme proves effective in authenticating whether the carrier image belongs to a party laying claim to the image's ownership, its main drawback is that the content of the watermark is required in order to recover the watermark authentication circuit needed to validate the ownership of the carrier images. To solve this, a watermarking scheme for quantum images based on QFT was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[122]</ref>. This watermark technique authenticates ownership of the carrier image actively (i.e., by extracting the watermark image without knowing what it is). However, as its drawback, the whole computation process realized using this technique is incapable of maintaining the normalized quantum image state, because their embedding strength controlling parameter is a fixed parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">121,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">122]</ref>. In addition, two dynamic watermarking schemes, i.e., QWT-based watermarking <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">117]</ref> and Hadamard transform-based watermarking <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[82]</ref>, which utilize dynamic vectors to control the embedding strength instead of a fixed parameter for embedding process in <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[122]</ref>, were proposed. These schemes suggest it is possible to get better visual quality under a higher embedding capacity, which outperform other existing schemes.</p><p>The watermarking strategies above are all based on the FRQI representation. However, we should recall that the FRQI is a grayscale-based quantum representation, so all of the watermarking methods introduced earlier are only available for dealing with the grayscale images. Based on the MCQI representation, a new multi-channel watermarking strategy for quantum images, MC-WaQI, was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[111]</ref>. Using it, watermarking of colored quantum images appears realizable. In MC-WaQI, two keys are generated in the preprocessing stage of the scheme, one of them (color information key or briefly CIK) is dynamically produced by the quantum measurement to protect the color information of the watermark image for embedding information in the spatial domain of the cover image, while the other key (position information key or briefly PIK) is fixed and preassigned by the watermark owner to scramble the position information of the watermark image for the embedding in frequency domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[122]</ref>. The adoption of MCQI representation for the carrier and watermark images facilitates the protection of colored quantum images and provides a duple protection on the carrier image, which also improves the capability of watermarked images to withstand malicious attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[111]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, Jiang et al. proposed a Moiré pattern-based NEQR quantum image steganography strategy (a technique that hides a secret message into quantum images) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. It is designed primarily as a steganographic algorithm and corresponding quantum circuits that hides a binary image into a grayscale image. The embedding algorithm begins with the choice of an initial Moiré grating, i.e., a stochastic image, as the cover image, and then deforms the initial Moiré grating according to the secret image, and the deformed Moiré grating is the Moiré pattern. Finally, the Moiré pattern is altered to obtain the stego image. Then in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, this work was further enhanced with the proposal of two blind LSB (least significant bit) steganography algorithms in the form of quantum circuits based on NEQR representations. One algorithm is plain LSB, and it uses the message bits to substitute for the pixels' LSB directly. The other is block LSB, and it embeds a message bit into a number of pixels that belong to one image block. The experimental results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> demonstrate that the invisibility is good, and the balance between the capacity and the robustness can be adjusted according to the needs of applications. In addition, Wang et al. also proposed a concrete least significant qubit (LSQb) information hiding algorithm for NEQR quantum images <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[101]</ref>. LSQb information hiding embeds a secret message qubit stream into the last qubit of color of quantum cover image. Moreover, the information hiding is researched on the frequency domain which can increase the security of quantum cover image.</p><p>Another aspect for quantum image security is the image encryption as introduced earlier. An encryption and decryption algorithm using geometric transformations on FRQI quantum images was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[131]</ref>. In doing this, the correlations among adjacent pixels were reserved which means that the encrypted images were not noiselike and the sketches can be identified visually. As an improvement, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[83]</ref>, the encryption scheme used the quantum image geometric transformations to shuffle the codes of pixel positions, and further the color transformations were performed to recode the color codings in the FRQI images. In addition, the double random-phase encoding technique is generalized to quantum scenarios, which was used together with QFT to realize a robust quantum image encryption/decryption method <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[116]</ref>. Similarly, a novel encryption algorithm for FRQI quantum image based on QWT and double diffusions was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[102]</ref>. A seemingly more secure FRQI image encryption method based on image correlation decomposition was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. Therein, the whole quantum image is divided into a series of sub-images and stored into a complete binary tree array, after which they were randomly performed by one of the operations, i.e., quantum random-phase gate, quantum revolving gate, and Hadamard transform. Finally, the encrypted image can be obtained by superimposing the resulting sub-images using the superposition principle of quantum states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Quantum image strip-based applications</head><p>A dextrous property of the strip representation used to encode 2 m -ending quantum images (STQI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">109]</ref> lies in its ability to utilize the parallelism inherent to quantum computation in order to transform multiple images using very few quantum resources. The 2 m -ending FRQI/MCQI quantum images encoded in a strip (which we shall call F-strip and M-strip, respectively) can be horizontally oriented or vertically oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[109]</ref>. Control-condition operations on strip wires could control which image is being processed. Combined with the control-condition operations from the position |y |x to the color wire, every pixel in this strip can be accessed and/or manipulated.</p><p>Based on the FRQI representation for quantum images and its basic geometric transformations on them, a method to compare multiple pairs of quantum images in parallel was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">113]</ref>. The F-strip is used to compare multiple quantum images of the same size. It does this because an operation on the strip wire can transform the information in all the images in the strip simultaneously. The strip does not only make the comparison of quantum images possible, but it also provides an efficient way to execute multiple operations on multiple pairs of quantum images in parallel. There are three steps to complete the parallel comparison, namely the quantum image preparation, image comparison, and measurement results' observation. The layout of the scheme to compare quantum images in parallel is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The proposed quantum image comparison method is proven to require less computational resources and hence offers a significant speedup in comparison with performing the same task on traditional computing devices. Similarly, a complete scheme of solving the similarity of two multi-dimensional quantum color images, i.e., NAQSS, was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[129]</ref>, where two cases, i.e., the color image with segmentation information and without segmentation information, were considered, respectively.</p><p>Based on the method of parallel comparison of quantum images, a quantum image searching method was further explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[106]</ref>. The proposal was built on a modified definition for the strip to allow a horizontal combination of two F-strips, which are located on the left and right side, called the Z-strip. The operation to search for images on quantum mechanical systems is realized by using only a single Hadamard gate and several measurements. On a classical computer, however, such an image searching scheme can only be achieved by comparing one pair of images at a time. Hence, the proposed method offers a significant speedup compared to how it is performed using classical computing resources.</p><p>Although the research targeting quantum images has already made a lot of progress as discussed before, the advances in quantum video are just beginning to gain traction. Perhaps, this could be attributed to the large size (in terms of a number of frames) and the enormity of resources required to process the data encoded in these frames.</p><p>As reviewed earlier, Iliyasu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> were credited with proposing the quantum movie framework, which in its generalized form can be seen as the utilization of Fstrip. Quantum movies consist of multiple frames (quantum images) that comprise of slight changes from one frame to the next which combine to produce a single shot. The flexibility inherent to the FRQI quantum image as well as the feasibility of representing and controlling multiple quantum images is some of the properties that allow the use of the F-strip in quantum movies. The quantum movie framework itself is built on three conceptual devices: the quantum CD, quantum player, and movie reader <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> are used to achieve the preparation, manipulation, and measurement of the quantum movie. The quantum CD is defined as a device required to prepare, initialize, and store 2 m multiple frames, while the main objective of quantum player is to manipulate the content of these frames to convey a scene from the movie. As the movie reader, it measures the contents of the sequence of frames in order to retrieve and recover the contents of the movie <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>.</p><p>There are three types of frames in a quantum movie, i.e., a key frame, viewing frame, and makeup frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, which are all FRQI quantum states. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> outlines the proposed schematics for these three types of frames as explained. Extending the formalism described in the quantum movie framework to the MCQI representation and utilizing the M-strip, the notion of color quantum video is realized as the basis on which the quantum video encryption and decryption on quantum computers is built <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[112]</ref>.</p><p>As presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> and utilized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[112]</ref>, two or more key frames that exhibit very little resemblance to each other could delineate one shot. Using Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> as an example, we focus on the key frames, |F 1 , |F 2 , . . . , |F m , by preparing many copies of them on which quantum measurements to generate the CIKs are performed. The eight different elements in the CIK as well as the corresponding operations based on a specified Col or CS operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[87]</ref> are adopted so that the color information in the frames could be transformed. According to the CIKs obtained from the key frames, we then execute the same color transformations on the viewing frames and the makeup frames to complete the quantum video encryption procedure. The decryption procedure is used to recover the content of the encrypted video. Since all the transformations used in quantum computation are unitary transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>, it follows that the encryption procedure is completely reversible.</p><p>Generally, video encryption should make the quantum video indiscernible in order to avoid the illegal copyright and tampering by the unauthorized users, while the video decryption recovers the encrypted video back to its pristine format for access by the authorized users (with the correct keys). The method is considered secure, fast, and flexible <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[112]</ref>. The combination of these two procedures facilitate the secure transmission and sharing of video in quantum communication.</p><p>In addition, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[108]</ref>, Yan et al. proposed a method for moving object detection in multi-channel quantum video (MTD) which could detect the location of the moving target in each frame of the quantum video, thereby providing a motion trail that could be used to describe the path or trajectory of the object. This work presents a modest attempt to utilize quantum computing properties for moving target in quantum video research. Further, such a work will inspire the electronic image stabilization in quantum video (QIS), which we will investigate in the future.</p><p>To summarize, in these three subsections, we have tried to highlight some of the astounding properties that have been made in QIMP as evinced by the many applications it has been used for. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> presents a brief graph simplifying the progress made in QIMP. All the acronyms therein have been mentioned earlier in this review. of research and technology development, we must identify, design, and implement disruptive algorithms and 'killer apps' (i.e., high-impact applications) that clearly show the power and advantages of QIMP over its classical counterpart. In the following lines, we share with the readership some thoughts about future research trends in QIMP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Algorithmic advantages of existing QIMP protocols (1) Comparison with best classical image processing protocols</head><p>In this review article, we have summarized several protocols devoted to storing, processing, and retrieving visual information using quantum mechanical systems. Indeed, some computational advantages and disadvantages of those protocols arise when making comparisons among them (e.g., the number of qubits used for storing images), but in order to clearly exhibit the true value and usefulness of those quantum protocols in both theoretical and applied computer science as well as in engineering applications, a comprehensive comparison analysis is yet to be produced.</p><p>For each existing QIMP protocol, we must compute accurate formulae for the computational complexity of algorithms used for storing and retrieving images as well as the amount of (quantum and classical) physical resources employed for those tasks. This endeavor must be undertaken so that its results can be meaningfully compared with the computational complexity and resource consumption of corresponding classical algorithms. This is crucial for two reasons:</p><p>-The complexity of QIMP algorithms is usually computed in terms of quantum gates, while classical complexity is usually computed in terms of algorithm running time. -Quantum hardware designers must clearly identify the amount of classical and quantum resources needed to implement a given QIMP protocol.</p><p>(2) Advanced toolkits In order to use existing and upcoming QIMP protocols to develop quantum algorithms in fields like computer vision, automatic surveillance and manufacturing, a set of basic and advanced image operations must be developed for each protocol.</p><p>These toolkits should include quantum routines for performing basic tasks as rotations and region swapping, as well as advanced procedures for performing image filtering, scrambling, filtering, encryption/decryption and segmentation, among several others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Applications for solving open problems in science and engineering</head><p>(1) Classical and quantum information Quantum algorithms can be used to solve problems defined within the realms of classical or quantum information. For example, quantum algorithms can be developed to solve hard instances of the 3SAT problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref> or to simulate quantum systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</p><p>So far, published results in our field have mainly focused on processing classical images in quantum mechanical systems, i.e., processing classical information. Of course, this work has been of paramount importance to build the foundations of our field as well as to attract the attention of applied computer scientists and engineers who work on areas related to image processing. Meanwhile, research on storing, processing, and visualizing quantum information is a territory largely untouched. Thus, in addition to further progress on processing classical images on quantum systems, new research efforts should be devoted to designing algorithms to process signals/images produced by sources of quantum information.</p><p>Algorithms developed to process and visualize quantum information could become the building blocks of new methods to present complex data to experts as well as to the general public (data visualization is an active area of contemporary research <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). For instance, processing and visualizing data emanated from areas like quantum light sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[78]</ref> using QIMP techniques may lead to novel methods to analyze and present data.</p><p>(2) Science and engineering Scrutinizing models and understanding results via data visualization are a fruitful approach for efficient problem solving. Due to the immense amount of visual information available from a plethora of fields and the everlasting quest for efficient methods, computer image processing is a pervasive discipline in many areas of science and engineering like computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[89]</ref>, astrophysics <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[79]</ref>, and medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22]</ref>, among many others. We foresee two scenarios for further development of our field: a) Basic scientific research. Visualization of experimental results is of great value in many scientific disciplines (e.g., astrophysics, bioinformatics, and nanotechnology). In this regard, the development of QIMP algorithms could contribute toward solving open challenges in image processing (for example, enhancing superresolution algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref>) as well as on realizing novel methods to process classical and quantum information (e.g., QIMP of phytoplankton data produced by multicolor flow cytometry techniques using quantum dots <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[97]</ref>). b) Applications in engineering. There is plenty of room for novel applications of QIMP, particularly in highly visible fields like medical images, automatic surveillance, pattern recognition, (nano) manufacturing, and technology for law enforcement. Applications of QIMP algorithms in all branches of engineering are a key area of future work in our field for the following reasons:</p><p>-Developing algorithms to solve complex and real-life problems is an effective way to attract the attention of funding organizations. Hence, in order to increase the amount of financial resources in our field, we should create 'killer apps' of QIMP algorithms in high-impact fields, i.e., in areas that are both complex and visible to society at large. -Engineering solutions focus on performance and accuracy, either as a result of market consumer demands (e.g., digital cameras: In less than twenty years, products on this market ranged from image size of 756 × 504 pixels and 500 g of weight (Kodak DC40, Table <ref type="table">I</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) to image size of 18 megapixels and 245 g of weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> ) or as key technical requirements within a given domain of application (for example, digital processing of medical images <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>). In both contexts, researchers working on QIMP could make use of the physical and mathematical properties of quantum computing (e.g., entanglement and quantum parallelism) as well as to propose novel uses of existing quantum algorithms and protocols (e.g., quantum teleportation) to design innovative solutions. -Algorithms for specific-purpose hardware. One of the main goals in quantum computing is to design quantum algorithms that are more efficient (i.e., faster) than their classical counterparts. This goal usually has an implicit assumption: Both quantum and classical algorithms are to be executed on general-purpose and universal computers. Unfortunately, the quest for quantum algorithms running on universal computers has left somewhat behind the development of advanced quantum algorithms for specific-purpose architectures. Meanwhile, specific-purpose architectures are used in many areas of computer and communications technology (e.g., content-addressable memories for network routers <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[69]</ref>). In our opinion, specificpurpose hardware is a blue-sky arena for developing QIMP algorithms as well as to attract funding from industrial partners (for example, QIMP algorithms to run on specific-purpose devices like advanced digital cameras or next generations of TV technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref>).</p><p>(3) Military applications In addition to its key role in National Security programs, research on military scientific and technological topics is a most interesting activity, due to the very challenging nature of problems faced in those fields and the interdisciplinary teams that usually aim at solving those problems.</p><p>Image processing is a major component in military technology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">93]</ref>) and quantum information and quantum computation are areas of interest for military application <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">75]</ref>. Hence, developing QIMP algorithms that can be used in scientific and engineering applications in this domain (e.g., quantum radar <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>) is a potentially fruitful area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Concluding remarks</head><p>Beyond the ongoing efforts toward physical realization of quantum computing hardware, research is focused on what can be done with these technologies when realization has been intensified <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. Encouraged by the de rigueur ubiquity and benefits of image and video processing applications and devices in today's world, the last half decade has seen a surge in efforts to extend conventional image and video processing to the quantum computing paradigm. This effort has given birth to a new sub-discipline known as QIMP. At the onset, QIMP is devoted to conjuring representations to capture images based on the quantum mechanical composition of any potential quantum hardware.</p><p>The main purpose of this review is to gather the current mainstream QIRs and discuss the advances made in the area. In doing so, some similarities, differences, shortcomings, and likely applications for some of the available QIRs were reviewed. Having established itself as the paragon among QIRs, the FRQI representation has the highest number of applications and algorithmic frameworks built on it, and so, most of our review was based on it. The mathematical formalism, computational requirements and outlook, and likely applications emanating from most of the available QIRs were also reviewed.</p><p>Buoyed by the growing interest in QIMP in general, as well as the enthusiasm generated by FRQI in particular, Iliyasu et al. espoused the realization of FRQI application-specific hardware to the advances made in photonic (or optical) quantum computing technologies to provide an insightful compendium of the level of maturity in the area and the likely impediments to the realization of QIMP quantum computing hardware. We recommend interested readers to find more information about it from <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref> as a basis to simulate interest geared toward the realization of QIMP-specific quantum computing hardware.</p><p>With additional efforts to improve on this work or offer similar espousitions along different quantum computing technologies, attention should be devoted on how to realize some low-level image and video processing applications and hardware for QIMP. All these efforts are essential for the realization of smooth, effective, and secure QIMP technologies, thereby allowing mankind to take full advantage of the immense potential of quantum computing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 A 2 × 2 FRQI quantum image and its quantum state (figure adapted from [51])</figDesc><graphic coords="9,53.40,56.30,331.72,71.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
