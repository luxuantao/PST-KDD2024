<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Identifying Drug-Target Interactions (DTIs) is an important process in drug discovery. Traditional experimental methods are expensive and timeconsuming for detecting DTIs. Therefore, computational approaches provide many effective strategies to deal with this issue. In recent years, most of computational methods only use the information of drug-drug similarity or target-target similarity, which cannot perfectly capture all characteristics to identify DTIs. In this paper, we propose a novel computational model of DTIs prediction, based on machine learning methods. To improve the performance of prediction, we further use molecular substructure fingerprints, Multivariate Mutual Information (MMI) of proteins and network topology to represent drugs, targets and relationship between them. Moreover, we employ Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Feature Selection (FS) to construct model for predicting DTIs. Experiments of evaluation show that proposed approach achieves better results than other outstanding methods for feature-based DTIs prediction. The proposed approach achieves AUPRs of 0.899, 0.929, 0.821 and 0.655 on Enzyme, Ion Channel (IC), GPCR and Nuclear Receptor datasets, respectively. Compared with existing best methods, AUPRs are increased by 0.016 on Ion Channel datasets. In addition, our method obtains the second best performance on</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Many biological signaling pathways involve autocrine ligand-receptor interactions, and cells contain lots of highly specific targets. Drugs act on the cell membrane by physical and chemical interactions. The analysis of DTIs is a key role of the drug discovery process, and many researchers spend a lot of 5 attentions in drug development on filtering receptor binding compounds. The computational technique is able to promote ligand research in an innovative drug-design environment.</p><p>In drug discovery, researchers require some labels to mark the binding of a drug to its receptor, which costs extra time and high error rate. Furthermore, 10 a quantitative ranking of drug-target interactions can be valuable in the drug discovery. Thus, it is very important to develop an efficient computational approach to detect DTIs. The interaction network is retrieved from the BRENDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, KEGG BRITE <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, SuperTarget <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> and DrugBank <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> databases. Most of the computational method is based on diversified information, including chemical 15 structure of drugs, sequence of proteins, network of instances.</p><p>In general, these computational methods can be classified as the following: docking simulation methods and machine learning methods. Docking simulation methods detect DTIs through the structural information of targets. But it is more time-consuming, compared with machine learning techniques. Determining 3D 20 structures of target is still quite difficult to obtain. So, lots of methods based on machine learning were developed to predict DTIs. The machine learning has been widely used in bioinformatics, and achieved very good results <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. The</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>DTIs prediction can be regarded as a binary classification problem. What's more, machine learning methods can be subdivided into two subtypes: kernel matrices 25 method via similarity measures (i.e., genomic, chemical and pharmacological spaces) and feature vector-based method (DTI pairs are represented as feature vectors).</p><p>The main strategy of kernel matrices-based methods is to build kernel matrices through similarity between drugs and similarity between targets. Each DTIs Bayesian Matrix Factorization with Twin Kernels (KBMF2K) by Gönen, M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>,</p><p>Regularized Least Squares model (RLS) by Laarhoven et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, Bipartite Local Model (BLM) by Bleakley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Bipartite Local Mode with Neighbor-based 40 Interaction-profile Inferring (BLM-NII) by Mei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, Laplacian Regularized Least Square based on interaction network (NetLapRLS) by Xia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>,</p><p>Weighted Nearest Neighbor with Gaussian Interaction Profile kernels (WNN-GIP) by Laarhoven et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Collaborative Matrix Factorization (CMF) by Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> and Neighborhood Regularized Logistic Matrix Factorization (NRLMF) 45 by Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. NormMulInf is a semi-supervised learning framework, through collaborative filtering theory by Peng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. But the defect of the most kernel-based methods is that there are lots of samples to be classified with remarkable computational complexity. In addition, they did not consider the biological information in the protein domain. These methods did not fully 50 describe the protein sequence through some physical and chemical properties of amino acids. These properties can improve part of the prediction accuracy.</p><p>To avoid the problem, other machine learning approaches of feature vectorbased method extracted both drug and target features from molecular fingerprint</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>of drug and sequence descriptors of target as well as known drug-target inter-55 actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref>. Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6]</ref>  properties of protein sequences. In recent years, the similar approaches of sequence descriptors have been widely used to the protein-protein interaction prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10]</ref>. These substructures of drug and amino acid properties are 75 the key to detect DTI pairs. The DTIs are due to some substructures of drug binding with residues of target through the physical and chemical properties.</p><p>Therefore, MACCS and MMI can improve the prediction accuracy. From the perspective of polypharmacology, the network feature could be considered as a pharmacology properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. Limits of mainstream works (kernel matrices-based methods) mainly come 95 from the following aspects: (1) they did not consider the amino acid composition of target protein, when the similarity kernel matrix of target was constructed;</p><p>(2) the substructures of drug are redundant, and some of substructure are not presence; (3) lots of methods did not utilize the properties of network topology to build model. For above three problems, our approach has handled them by 100 some strategies. One of critical tasks of detecting DTIs by machine learning methods is feature extraction of DTIs. In this study, the protein representation method of mutual information is firstly utilized in the field of DTIs prediction.</p><p>In a protein sequence, mutual information of two amino acids describes the mutual dependence between these two amino acids. It deeply reflects amino acid 105 combinations in sequence. In addition, the dimension of original MACCS feature is redundant. Different from previous methods, we employ FS technology to reduce the redundant noise of feature space. The known relationships of DTIs are also extracted to improve prediction performance. The results of experiment confirms that the prediction performance of our model is comparable or even 110 better than state-of-the-art methods.</p></div>

Because the DTIs network profiling is essentially a cross-pharmacology-related profiling, the topology information of total training network could improve the performance 120 of prediction. Here, we use above DTIs information, FS technique and SVM to build prediction model for identifying DTIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Representing Drug with Molecular Substructure Fingerprint</head><p>Here, we utilize molecular substructure fingerprints to describe drug. Molecular substructure fingerprint directly encodes the structure as a binary vector, 125 which can represent the presence or absence of some specific substructures in one drug. Moreover, it does not need 3D structure of the drug molecule. The fingerprint of MACCS has a MDL dictionary. The definition of MACCS fingerprint is available from OpenBabel (http://openbabel.org/). For MACCS fingerprint, chemical information (chem) of the drug is represented as a feature 130 vector f chem-M ACCS , via 166 common substructures. A demo of fingerprint with substructure dictionary is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>.</p></div>

Composition, Transition and Distribution (CTD) contain much information of one protein sequence. These features were fed into Random Forest (RF) model 60 for training and prediction. Zaynab et al. [20] used the bi-gram features and molecular substructure fingerprint to represent target and drug, respectively. But most of feature vector-based methods did not consider the network feature. In essence, network feature contains the association between drug-target pairs. Inspired by above methods, we propose a computational approach to identify 65 DTIs by combining three types of information: (1) properties of chemistry (chem), the substructure fingerprint; (2) properties of biology (bio), containing physicochemical properties; (3) properties of network topology (net), containing drug-target relationship of training network.

But, the similarity matrices of drug and target could not extract more key property from drug-target interaction. To resolve above issue, a few methods were proposed on information of protein sequences and drug topological substructure. To improve the performance of prediction, we further use the molecular substructure 440 fingerprints, MMI of protein sequences and network topology to represent the drug, target and relationship between them. The results of our experiment have demonstrated the ability of the proposed approach. Our method achieves AUPRs of 0.899, 0.929, 0.821 and 0.655 on Enzyme, IC, GPCR and Nuclear Receptor datasets, respectively. 445 The major challenges of DTIs prediction include: (1) fully describing the critical information of DTIs (extracting the feature of DTIs); (2) the problem of imbalanced data. For the first problem, we utilize molecular substructure fingerprint of drug, a novel MMI feature of target and topology of network to describe DTIs information. And the MMI feature performed well. The 450 second problem of imbalanced data is common in computational biology. The performance of AUPR can also be further improved on imbalanced data of DTIs.In generally, SVM is used to handle the imbalanced classification problem by class weight. However, the performance of weighted SVM is poor on extremely imbalanced data (the ratio between majority and minority examples is usually 455 larger) and in many complex tasks. To reduce model complexity and improve computational efficiency, we only consider the model of weighted SVM (without sampling or filtering) in this study. Other better machine learning approaches, such as Neural Networks with Random Weights<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> and Sparse Representation model, can be used to build classifier rather than SVM. In Alhamdoosh and 460 Wang's work<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, DNNE algorithm built ensemble model with bootstrap sampling and weighting sub-classifiers. DNNE algorithm is an effective strategy to deal with the imbalanced problem. The Stochastic Configuration Networks Ensemble (SCNE)<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is a newly developed ensemble, which always outperforms the DNNE.A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P TIn the future, we will build the classification model by strategy of SCNE or 465 even utilize the SCNE on the imbalanced data of DTIs. The ensemble classifier (with bootstrap sampling and weighting sub-classifiers) could further improve the performance of DTIs prediction.

These results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing outstanding approaches on Ion Channel dataset, and is comparable on Enzyme and GPCR datasets. However, our method and other existing tools didn't perform well on Nuclear receptor. The main reason is 375 that the size of Nuclear receptor data set is too small and imbalance data set exacerbates this problem. What's more, the performance of our method (no net) are worse than the method including net features. Comparing with proposed method, the AUPRs of our method (no net) drop 0.226, 0.22, 0.295 and 0.198 on four datasets, respectively. Net features could help model improve the prediction 380 performance of DTIs. The average AUC and AUPR of our method are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">12</ref>.</p></div>

In C2, C3 and C4, values of AUC fall gently by 0.048, 0.106 and 0.170 on average. Because of imbalanced datasets, values of AUPR fall sharply by 0.174, 0.431 and 0.617 on average. Tests of C2, C3 and C4 are only used to evaluate the performance of pair-input computational prediction.  </p></div>
