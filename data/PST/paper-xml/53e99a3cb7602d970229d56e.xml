<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper analyzes the convergence of optimal control problems for an evolution equation in a finite time-horizon [0, T ] toward the limit steady state ones as T → ∞. We focus on linear problems. We first consider linear time-independent finite-dimensional systems and show that the optimal controls and states exponentially converge in the transient time (as T tends to infinity) to the ones of the corresponding steady state model. For this to occur suitable observability assumptions need to be imposed. We then extend the results to infinite-dimensional systems including the linear heat and wave equations with distributed controls.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction.</head><p>In this paper, we address the question of the limiting behavior of optimal control problems as the time-horizon tends to infinity. More specifically, we analyze the convergence of the trajectories and controls which are optimal in [0, T ] toward the stationary state and control which are optimal for the corresponding stationary regime.</p><p>In general terms, the question could be set as follows. We are given a dynamics under some conditions ensuring that this control problem as well as the stationary analogue, namely, min u J s (u) := L(x, u) with the constraint f (x, u) = 0, are well posed.</p><p>In other words, we assume that both J T and J s admit minimal controls (and states), possibly unique.</p><p>The question we address is the following: to which extent do the long horizon optimal controls and states u T (t), x T (t) approximate the stationary ones ū, x as T → ∞?</p><p>Of course, this kind of question can lead to several possible directions of investigation (finite-or infinite-dimensional systems, linear or nonlinear dynamics, generality of the cost functional, etc.). This paper is fully devoted to the linear case, both in finite and infinite dimensions.</p><p>The motivation is multifold. On one hand is the study of long time behavior of mean field games systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This leads to a system of PDEs which can be seen as the optimality system of a (bilinear) optimal control problem for a convection diffusion equation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>). While studying ergodicity properties and long time stability of the mean field games systems, it is proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that in the long horizon problem the optimal controls and states are close, in average, to the stationary ones, and in some cases they are exponentially close in the transient time, namely, far from t = 0 and t = T . On the other hand, the use of steady state models for optimal design is classical in aeronautics (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). It is then natural to ask the question of whether these steady state optimal designs are limits as time tends to infinity of time-evolution optimal designs. Of course, in that setting these questions need to be addressed in the complex context of Euler and Navier-Stokes equations and for models of turbulence. The theory is far from being applicable in that context. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, motivated by optimal control problems in fluid mechanics, a first attempt has been made within the frame of hyperbolic conservation laws, where the problem of passing to the limit as time tends to infinity in the linearization of 1d scalar hyperbolic conservation laws toward the steady state ones has been analyzed.</p><p>These results and topics suggest a need to look more closely to the question of the long time behavior of optimality systems.</p><p>One of the main goals of this paper consists in establishing the role played by stabilization and observability estimates in order to get the convergence of finite horizon control problems in [0, T ] to their steady state version as T tends to infinity. Indeed, although these assumptions are not needed when considering the optimal control problem in a fixed finite time interval, they are essential to perform the analysis as the time-horizon tends to infinity.</p><p>Our first result refers to the finite-dimensional case. We denote by M N,M the set of N × M matrices.</p><p>Theorem 1.1. Let A ∈ M N,N , B ∈ M N,M , u ∈ L 2 (0, T ; R M ), and x 0 ∈ R N , and consider the dynamics</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x t + Ax = Bu, x(0) = x 0 .</formula><p>Given a matrix C ∈ M N,N , and some z ∈ R N , consider the optimal control problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">min u J T (u) = 1 2 T 0 (|u(t)| 2 + |Cx(t) -z| 2 )dt,</formula><p>which admits a unique optimal control and state (u T , x T ).</p><p>Assuming that (A, B) is controllable and (A, C) is observable, we have that there exist positive constants λ and K, independent on T , such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">|u T (t) -ū| + |x T (t) -x| ≤ K(e -λt + e -λ(T -t) ) ∀t ∈ [0, T ],</formula><p>where (ū, x) are the stationary optimal control and state. Actually, in this finite-dimensional case, λ will be characterized as the exponential stability index for a stabilized dynamics using the algebraic Riccati equation.

Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php</p><p>Based on the methods we develop to prove this finite-dimensional result, we also obtain similar results for parabolic equations (see Theorem 3.10), as well as for wave equations (see section 4). We pay special attention to the case of control and/or observation operators localized in an open subset of the domain where the dynamics evolves.</p><p>Our analysis is restricted to linear problems, but we hope to pave the way for a more general approach to the question which may, eventually, be used in nonlinear problems as well.</p><p>Let us also remark that similar questions could be addressed from the point of view of Hamilton-Jacobi equations (finite-or infinite-dimensional). But, although this approach could lead to the convergence analysis of 1  T min J T toward min J s by looking at the long time behavior of the value function, the convergence of the optimal control and states does not seem to be achieved in the literature by this approach. One of the possible reasons is that the construction of the optimal control (and therefore state) involves intrinsically a forward-backward mechanism. This forward-backward feature is evident in the structure of the optimality system and makes the question of long time behavior nonstandard. As suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, boundary layers may occur at t = 0 and t = T and stability should be observed in the transient time. Here we support this hint by showing how, in the linear framework, such a result can be obtained using tools from control theory, specifically, some stabilization and uncoupling methods as classically addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The exponential rate of this stability is a significant byproduct of our approach, compared with previous ones.</p><p>At this stage it is worth mentioning that a whole literature, mainly motivated by economic theories, has been concerned with this kind of stationary behavior in the transient time for long horizon control problems. In that context, such type of result goes under the name of turnpike property (more precisely, middle type turnpike property for our kind of behavior), according to a terminology introduced by P. Samuelson. This property was mostly investigated in the finite-dimensional case, as well as in connection to Calculus of Variations, although in a slightly different framework with respect to our setting. Because it is impossible to quote all relevant contributions in this area, we refer the reader to the extensive survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> (and references therein), to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for some results on control problems in the infinitedimensional case, and to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for some related results on unbounded solutions to the Riccati equation, with applications to zero-sum games.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we analyze the finitedimensional case in detail. In section 3 we discuss the case of parabolic equations. Section 4 is devoted to the wave equation. Finally, in section 5 we discuss several open problems and related issues.</p></div>

Similarly, since (A * , B * ) is observable due to (2.5), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">|(p T (0) -p)| ≤ c T 0 |C(x T -x)| 2 dt + T 0 |B * (p T -p)| 2 dt 1 2</formula><p>, which implies in particular (2.16)</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">|(p T (0) -p)| ≤ c T 0 |C(x T -x)| 2 dt + T 0 |u T -ū| 2 dt + T 0 |ū + B * p| 2 dt 1 2</formula><p>.</p><p>Using (2.15) and (2.16) in (2.14), we deduce in particular that (2.17)</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">T 0 |u T -ū| 2 + |C(x T -x)| 2 dt ≤ C T ; hence the averages 1 T T 0 u T (t) dt and 1 T T 0 Cx T (t) dt are bounded in R N . Moreover, the state equation implies A 1 T T 0 x T dt = 1 T T 0 Bu T dt - x T (T ) -x 0 T</formula><p>and since the last term is vanishing as T → ∞ (because of estimates (2.15) and (2.17)), we deduce that </p><formula xml:id="formula_27">T T 0 u T (ū + B * p) dt T →∞ → 0</formula><p>for any p satisfying (2.12). We conclude from (2.14) that</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">1 T T 0 |u T -ū| 2 + |C(x T -x)| 2 dt ≤ C √ T - 1 T T 0 u T (ū + B * p) dt T →∞ → 0.</formula><p>This immediately implies that</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">(2.18) 1 T T 0 Cx T (t) dt → C x, 1 T T 0 u T (t) dt → ū.</formula><p>The convergence of x T to x follows now from the averaged state equation and (2.9). Finally, in a similar way as we did before for x T , using now (2.9) for (A * , B * ), we prove that the average 1 T T 0 p T dt is bounded in R N and, up to subsequences, converges to some p ∈ R N . Passing to the limit in the averaged equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">A * 1 T T 0 p T dt = 1 T T 0 C * (Cx T -z) dt - p T (0) T</formula><p>we realize that p is a solution of (2.12), and since u T = -B * p T , from the convergence of the average we deduce that ū = -B * p.

The rate λ is given in the proof of Theorem 2.3; it is the exponential rate of the stabilized dynamics A + BB * Ê, where Ê is the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation.</p><p>Remark 2.5. It should not be surprising that the assumptions of controllability and observability are crucial in order to have some long time convergence, as for the existence of the infinite horizon problem itself. Without the Kalman rank condition, one or more components of the system may be insensitive to the action of the control take, for instance, A = -1 0 0 0 and B = 0 0 0 1 and therefore cannot be stabilized in any way.

Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php</p><p>The proof of Theorem 2.3 relies on the fact that the optimal control is actually given by an affine feedback law, which becomes linear when the target is z = 0, namely, when we consider</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">J T 0 (u) = inf 1 2 T 0 (|u(t)| 2 + |Cx(t)| 2 )dt, (2.20) u ∈ L 2 (0, T ; R M ), x t + Ax = Bu, x(0) = x 0 .</formula><p>In this case, as is well known, the feedback law is constructed through the use of the Riccati equation. We recall the following lemma, which can be essentially found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> in the case that C is coercive. However, the proof can be easily adapted to the case that (A, C) is observable; we give it here shortly for the reader's convenience, as well as a guideline for the infinite-dimensional case, since most of the arguments admit a natural generalization in that setting.</p><p>Lemma 2.6.

The construction of the feedback law extends in a natural way the finite-dimensional case: we consider the control problem (3.9) with z = 0, and we define an operator on H by setting</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">E(T )x 0 := p T (0).</formula><p>It is immediate to check that E(T ) is linear, continuous, and nonnegative, being (see the proof of Theorem 3.8 in case z = x = p = 0) (E(T )x 0 , x 0 ) H = min J T 0 , where J T 0 is the functional J T with target z = 0. The variational characterization readily implies that E(t 1 ) ≤ E(t 2 ) for every t 1 ≤ t 2 . Since, in addition, E(t) is uniformly bounded, there exists lim T →∞ (E(T )x 0 , x 0 ) H which is characterized in terms of the regulator problem, defining a limit operator Ê. In fact, if T n → ∞, and we denote (x n , p n ) := (x Tn , p Tn ) the optimal couple for J Tn , we know from Theorem 3.8 that</p><formula xml:id="formula_104">Tn 0 [|B * p n | 2 + |Cx n | 2 ]dt ≤ K.</formula><p>So, from Hypotheses 3.1 and 3.3, x n , p n are bounded in H uniformly in time and bounded in L 2 loc (0, T ; X) as well.

On the other hand, since (x n , p n ) were optimal in (0, T n ), it is easy to see that (x, p) is the unique optimal couple for J ∞ and satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_106">(3.25) ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ xt + Ax = -Bj u B * p, -p t + A * p = C * j v C x, x(0) = x 0 , p(t) t→∞ → 0,</formula><p>where last condition should be meant in a weak sense.

Thus, we have so far defined the feedback laws E(t) and Ê. The semigroup property of the equation implies that the optimal control u T is then defined through the backward feedback</p><formula xml:id="formula_107">u T (t) = -j u B * E(T -t)x(t) ∀t ∈ [0, T ].</formula><p>Downloaded 04/12/14 to 134.208.103.160. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php Some technical issues may arise here concerning the measurability and continuity of the mapping t → E(t) and the meaning itself of the composition operator B * E(Tt); in principle, E goes from H into H, whereas B * is defined on X. To achieve the most generality, such technical issues are to be handled inside the semigroup theory for unbounded operators; a huge literature concerns this delicate issue (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>).</p><p>In order to avoid unnecessary technicalities, here we confine ourselves to the simplest case, assuming that B ∈ L(U, H), so B * can be defined directly as the adjoint in H. This is typically the case of distributed controls. Moreover, we assume that the embedding X ⊂ H is compact; in this case, one can easily prove that for every x 0 ∈ H, E(t)x 0 is continuous in [0, ∞) and that E(t)x 0 t→∞ → Êx 0 strongly in H. Now, by the semigroup property, we have p(t) = Ê x(t) for every t ∈ (0, ∞), and so x is the unique solution of the linear evolution problem (3.26)</p><formula xml:id="formula_108">x t + (A + Bj u B * Ê)x = 0, x(0) = x 0 .</formula><p>Note that this system has a unique strong solution since, under the above conditions, Bj u B * Ê is a bounded operator in H.

We collect this information in the following result, giving a self-contained proof of the exponential convergence only based on Hypotheses 3.1 and 3.3. Lemma 3.9. Assume that Hypotheses 3.1 and 3.3 hold and that X ⊂ H is compact and B ∈ L(U, H). Then, the linear system (3.26) is exponentially stable, and there exists μ &gt; 0 such that E(t) -Ê L(H,H) ≤ Ce -μt for any t &gt; 0.</p><p>Proof.

Since the embedding X ⊂ H is compact, standard arguments imply that z n is relatively compact in L 2 ((a, b); X), and then in C 0 ([a, b]; H) as well, for any interval (a, b) ⊂ R. Up to subsequences, z n (t) converges in H, pointwise and locally uniformly, to some function z which satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_117">z t + M z = 0 in (-∞, +∞).</formula><p>Moreover, since the definition of l(t) and its monotone character imply</p><formula xml:id="formula_118">( Ê xn (t n ), xn (t n )) H ≤ ( Ê xn (t + t n ), xn (t + t n )) H ≤ l(t + t n ) ∀t &lt; 0,</formula><p>due to (3.30), we conclude that ( Êz(t), z(t)) H is constant in (-∞, 0) and equal to lim t→∞ l(t).

Indeed, the estimate in Lemma 3.9 is obtained through only energy estimates relying on Hypotheses 3.1 and 3.3, without an explicit use of the differential Riccati equation. An alternative would have been to proceed again as in Corollary 2.7, namely, through a fixed point argument, which, however, would require the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the differential Riccati equation. Under the assumptions made, this is still possible using the results known in the literature (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and references Downloaded 04/12/14 to 134.208.103.160.

On the other hand, the conclusion of Lemma 3.9, obtained with self-contained arguments, is enough to deduce the exponential stability for the control problem (3.9).</p><p>Theorem 3.10.

The constant μ is the exponential rate of the stabilized dynamics (3.26), given by Lemma 3.9.

Let h T denote the solution of (3.33). As in the proof of Theorem 2.3, one can deduce from Lemma 3.9 and Gronwall's lemma that |h T (t)| H ≤ Ce -μ(T -t) for t ∈ (0, T ).

As a model example of the previous abstract results, we may consider the Dirichlet problem for a parabolic equation with internal control and observation.

In particular, the range of E(T ) lies in H 1 0 (Ω) × L 2 (Ω) and E(T ) is a nonnegative, uniformly bounded operator from H 1 0 (Ω) × L 2 (Ω) into dual, as well as monotone with respect to T , since E(T )(y 0 , y 1 ), (y 0 , y 1 ) = (F * (q T (0))q T t (0), y 0 ) H + (q T (0), y 1 ) H = min J T 0 ,</p><p>where J T 0 is the cost functional with target z = 0. Thanks to the monotone character and the uniform bound of E, and using local compactness properties of solutions of the wave equation, the operator E(T ) is proved to have a limit Ê such that Ê(y 0 , y 1 ) = (F * (q T (0))qt (0), q(0)), where q is the adjoint state for the regulator problem, i.e., the problem with infinite horizon. Then, as in the parabolic case, the exponential decrease for the regulator problem is established using the quadratic form defined by Ê as Lyapunov functional and the conclusion follows using Hypotheses 4.1 and 4.2. Let us note that in Examples 4.6 and 4.7, such hypotheses hold in a strong form, since y(t) and y t (t) are uniformly estimated in H 1 0 (Ω) and in L 2 (Ω), respectively, while (4.2) and (4.3) only require, a priori, an estimate for weaker norms. This makes the proof of the exponential stability (4.10) easier to achieve, following the same approach as in the previous section apart from suitable adaptation of the energy estimates.</p></div>

Our analysis is restricted to linear problems. The same questions arise in the nonlinear context as well. As mentioned in the introduction, in the theory of mean field games these questions arise for bilinear problems, while in aeronautics they emerge naturally in the nonlinear models of fluid mechanics. A systematic analysis of these issues is to be developed. Some results for nonlinear models exist with respect to the turnpike property (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>); it would be natural to analyze how the results of this paper extend to the nonlinear setting, e.g., to semilinear heat and wave equations.</p><p>3. In the nonlinear context it is also natural to address the same issues for the linearized equations around the optimal states and controls so as to analyze the proximity of steady state sensitivity with respect to the time-evolution one.</p><p>4. As indicated in the introduction it would be worth trying to obtain the results in this paper from the point of view of Hamilton-Jacobi equations (finite-or infinite-dimensional).</p><p>5. In the heat and wave equations considered in this paper the control entered the system in a localized manner, in an open subset of the domain where the equation evolves. But often in control theoretical applications the control enters through the boundary and the same can occur to the observation operator. Although most of the techniques employed in this paper can be adapted to that case, special attention has to be paid to the unboundedness of the control and observation operators and the details have to be worked out in each specific setting either in the general context of abstract semigroups or in specific examples using transposition. We refer, for instance, to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for a systematic presentation of the abstract theory of observation and control of infinite-dimensional systems.</p><p>Acknowledgments.
