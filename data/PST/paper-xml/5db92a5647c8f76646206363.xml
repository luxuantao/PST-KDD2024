<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Non-ferrous metals are indispensable industrial materials and strategic supports of national economic development. The price forecasting of non-ferrous metals is critical for investors, policymakers, and researchers. Nevertheless, an accurate and robust non-ferrous metals price forecasting is a difficult yet challenging problem due to severe fluctuations and irregular cycles in the metal price evolution. Motivated by the "Divide-and-Conquer" principle, we present a novel hybrid deep learning model, which combines the VMD (variational mode decomposition) method and the LSTM (long short-term memory) network to construct a forecasting model in this paper. Here, the VMD method is firstly employed to disassemble the original price series into several components. The LSTM network is used to forecast for each component. Lastly, the forecasting results of each component are aggregated to formulate an ultimate forecasting output for the original price series. To investigate the forecasting performance of the proposed model, extensive experiments have been executed using the LME (London Metal Exchange) daily future prices of Zinc, Copper and Aluminum, and other six state-of-the-art methods are included for comparison. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model has superior performance for non-ferrous metals price forecasting.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Non-ferrous metals, which include Zinc, Copper and Aluminum et al. are the basic materials for national economic development, and are the basis of most industries such as mechanical manufacturing, aerospace, electricity, house-hold appliances and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. With the rapid advancement of modern industry, non-ferrous metals play an increasingly crucial role in social development <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p><p>Price forecasting of raw materials in real world is a complex task where different factors are coupled and correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Non-ferrous metals are the raw materials with both commodity and financial attributes. The prices of them are often influenced by the global economic, supply-demand relationship, production cost, dollar current rate and other factors, so they fluctuate frequently and vary widely. On the other hand, for non-ferrous metals producing and processing enterprises, raw material procurement cost usually accounts for more than 60% of the total cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The volatile fluctuations and dramatic changes ✩ No author associated with this paper has disclosed any potential or pertinent conflicts which may be perceived to have impending conflict with this work. For full disclosure statements refer to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys. 2019.105006. of non-ferrous metals price will directly affect the judgment of manufacturers on the variation tendency of raw material price, and further affect the decision of operation. Therefore, an accurate and robust price forecasting method is of great significance for purchasers to plan and schedule non-ferrous metals.</p><p>In the past decades, the forecasting of non-ferrous metals price has attracted wide academic interests, and much effort has been made to forecast the price using various modeling approaches. Generally speaking, these methods can be divided into two categories: single model methods and hybrid model methods. For single model methods, the time series data is modeled and forecasted by an individual model. Dooly and Lenihan adopted lagged forward price model and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to predict monthly crash prices of Lead and Zinc. It was found that the forecasting cash prices using ARIMA model led to better results <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Aye et al. developed several models and embraced six global factors to predict the return of gold. They found that the dynamic model averaging (DMA) and dynamic model selection (DMS) models outperformed linear models (such as random walk) as well as Bayesian model averaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Chen et al. proposed a modified gray wave forecasting method which was a graphical forecasting method, to predict the monthly prices of two metals-Aluminum and Nickel with a multi-step-ahead prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>With the prosperity of machine learning, artificial intelligent methods are gradually applied. <ref type="bibr">Dehghani</ref>  to predict the Copper price volatility. The experimental results indicated that the performance of the Bat algorithm was better than the classic estimation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Liu et al. and Carrasco et al.</ref> utilized decision tree learning algorithm and support vector machine to forecast Copper future price of the London Metal Exchange respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Malliaris employed artificial neural network to forecast the prices of gold, oil, and the euro <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Sivalingam et al. forecasted the gold future price from the historical data of other four commodities like silver, crude oil, S&amp;P 500, and foreign exchange rate, using extreme learning machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Zhang and Liao examined the forecasting performance of radial basis function (RBF) neural network and hybrid fuzzy clustering algorithm using gold price. The empirical results showed a better performance of hybrid fuzzy clustering algorithm over the former <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Lasheras et al. employed ARIMA and two different kinds of ANN models (multilayer perception machine and Elman network) to forecast the Copper spot price from COMEX, and they showed that the performance of both neural network models was superior to ARIMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Although traditional neural networks have a good prediction ability, the accuracy is still unsatisfactory when facing dynamic and non-linear time-series data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) network <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> has been proved to be one of the most powerful models for processing sequence data like time series. Unlike the traditional ANN, LSTM introduces the memory cells, and the memories of previous inputs can be persisted in the network's internal state. Therefore, LSTM network can explore the inherent abstract features and grasp the hidden-level constant structures in data, then process time series with high prediction ability. With the development of machine learning and deep learning methods, the LSTM model has been widely employed in natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, time series prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, emotion analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and so on. These works indicate that LSTM has excellent ability to learn the dependencies among complex non-linear time series.</p><p>For hybrid model methods, the basic idea is to address the shortcomings of single model and generate a synergetic effect in forecasting, which have become the mainstream approaches recently. For example, Zhu et al. used a LHAR-CJ-G model to forecast the Chinese non-ferrous futures (like Copper and Aluminum futures) market volatility in Shanghai Futures Exchange, and effectively improved the explanatory power <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Werner and Esteban used a hybrid ANN-GARCH model with regressors to predict the price volatility of gold, silver and copper. Comparison experiments indicated that the incorporation of ANN increased forecasting accuracy compared with traditional GARCH model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Khasher et al. combined ARIMA model with fuzzy logic and ANN to predict the daily price of gold and exchange rate. It overcame the linear and data limitations of ARIMA models, and obtained more accurate results <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Li built a gold price forecasting model based on wavelet neural network (WNN) and improved artificial bee colony algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Zakaria et al. employed adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to forecast the volatility of Copper price, and used Genetic algorithm to estimate the parameters of ANFIS model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Diego and Werner developed a framework composed of a set of time series models, non-parametric models and hybrid specifications of both to forecast monthly volatility of Copper market. The results showed that the hybrid adaptive-GARCH-FIS model yielded the best predicting power <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Zhang et al.</ref> proposed a new HAR-CJN model to predict the Chinese non-ferrous metals futures market, like daily prices of Copper and Aluminum futures. Contrastive experiments indicated that the new HAR-CJN model can describe and predict daily price volatility <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The ''Decomposition-and-Ensemble'' framework, which is motivated by the ''Divide-and-Conquer'' principle, is one of the most popular hybrid model methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Here, the goal of decomposition is to disintegrate the original complex time series into several interdependent components. The tendency and fluctuation characteristics of subseries are more evident and help to lighten the burden of forecasting model. On the contrary, the main aim of ensemble is to aggregate the prediction results of subsequences to yield the forecasting consequence of original data <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>For decomposition methods, there are mainly wavelet decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Fourier decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Thomas et al. forecasted monthly base metal prices (Aluminum, Copper, Lead and Zinc) by means of an improved wavelet-ARIMA approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Since wavelet decomposition relies heavily on the mother wavelet functions before decomposing, Fourier decomposition usually generates a large number of meaningless harmonics when dealing with nonlinear time series, so they are seldom used in time series processing. However, due to the advantages in decomposing nonlinear and non-stationary time series, and the advantages in describing the local time scale instantaneous frequencies, EMD has been used widely <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Zhou presented an improved EMD online learning rate-based back-propagation neural network model for gold price forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Xian, He and Lai analyzed the KITCO gold price combining ensemble empirical model decomposition (EEMD) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Wen et al. incorporated complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) with SVM and ANN for analysis and prediction of gold price <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Meanwhile, EMD-based methods generally have the problems of boundary effects, mode overlap, sensitivity to noise and lack of exact mathematical foundations. These limitations may affect the final prediction results. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> is a new multiresolution technique for signal processing, which is entirely non-recursive variation model and has a solid theoretical foundation. It can decompose a raw signal into a series of subseries with specific bandwidth in spectral domain, and demonstrate better noise robustness and more precise component separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Recently, this method has been successfully employed to solve various problems, such as biomedical signal processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, fault detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, financial time series analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and so on.</p><p>Considering the excellent characteristics of VMD in dealing with non-linear and irregular signal decomposition, and the advantageous performance of LSTM in prediction, in this paper, a new hybrid model based on VMD and LSTM is proposed for non-ferrous metals price forecasting. Through the hierarchical model, the instability of the original sequence and limited ability of single predictor processing complex series are handled. In detail, we first decompose the original price series into several relatively stable IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Functions) using VMD, and the intrinsic linear and non-linear characteristics of the data can be captured more accurately. Then we train the LSTM forecasting models for each IMF sequence and obtain the corresponding prediction results. Finally, the forecasting results of all IMF components are aggregated to produce an ensemble forecasting consequence for the original price series. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method can capture the internal characteristics of the original data, learn the interdependence of historical data, and then effectively improve the overall prediction ability.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>(1) A novel non-ferrous metal price forecasting framework is proposed by combining with VMD and LSTM network. VMD, as a competitive signal decomposition method, is utilized to capture the irregular characteristics of raw data, and has better adaptability and decomposition effect than EMD. The LSTM network, which is a deep learning method, can explore the hidden highlevel interdependence of the non-ferrous metal price data, and the prediction is very effective.</p><p>(2) The ratio of residual energy after decomposition is subtly utilized to solve the problem of determining the appropriate mode number K in VMD. The appropriate K can not only improve the overall forecasting accuracy, but also avoid unnecessary computational overhead.</p><p>(3) Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed VMD-LSTM has higher level prediction accuracy and directional forecasting accuracy compared with other forecasting engines, and the comprehensive effect is better.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the basic methodology of VMD and LSTM, and introduces the system framework and forecasting procedure of the proposed hybrid model. In Section 3, the experimental design, the simulation results and comparative analysis are presented. Finally, Section 4 provides the conclusion remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methodology</head><p>In this section, two modules of the proposed hybrid method: variation mode decomposition (VMD) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network, as well as the general framework of VMD-LSTM model will be described detailedly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Variational mode decomposition</head><p>Variational mode decomposition (VMD) developed by Dragomiretskiy and Zosso <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> in 2014 is a state-of-the-art multiresolution technique for adaptive and non-recursive signal processing. The decomposition process of VMD is the construction and solution of the variational problem. It can decompose a real valued signal into a series of band-limited Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) u k in spectral domain owning specific sparsity properties. It is assumed that each IMF u k can be concentrated around a center frequency ω k which is determined along with the decomposition process. To access the bandwidth of each u k , the following three steps should be fulfilled:</p><p>Step 1: For each IMF u k , adopting Hilbert transform to obtain a unilateral frequency spectrum.</p><p>Step 2: Shifting the IMF's frequency spectrum to baseband region by mixing with an exponential tuned to the respective estimated center frequency.</p><p>Step 3: Estimating each IMF's bandwidth by utilizing the Gaussian smoothness of the demodulated signal, i.e., the squared L2-norm of the gradient.</p><p>The objective function explores the K IMFs of original signal, of which the sum value of the estimated bandwidth is the minimum. Furthermore, the aggregation of the IMFs should be equal to the input signal f (t), which is the constraint condition. Subsequently, the constrained variational problem can be given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">min {u k },{ω k } { K ∑ k=1     ∂ t [ (δ(t) + j πt ) * u k (t) ] e -jω k t     2 2 } s.t. K ∑ k=1 u k = f (t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where f (t) is the original signal to be decomposed, δ(t) is the Dirac distribution, t implicates the time script, * denotes the convolution operator, u k and ω k represent the kth IMF and the corresponding center frequency respectively. {u k } stands for the set of IMFs {u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u K } and {ω k } denotes the set of center fre- quencies of the IMFs {ω 1 , ω 2 , . . . , ω K }. K denotes the total num- ber of the IMFs, additionally the IMF with high-order k denotes low-frequency component.</p><p>In order to translate the above constraint variational problem into an unconstrained optimization problem, both quadratic penalty term and Lagrangian multipliers are considered. The augmented Lagrange equation can be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L({u k }, {ω k }, λ) = α K ∑ k=1     ∂ t [ (δ(t) + j π t ) * u k (t) ] e -jω k t     2 2 +      f (t) - K ∑ k=1 u k (t)      2 2 + ⟨ λ(t), f (t) - K ∑ k=1 u k (t) ⟩<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where λ(t) is Lagrange multiplication factor for tightening restraint, α refers to the balance parameter of the data fidelity constraint,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">  f (t) - ∑ K k=1 u k (t)    2 2</formula><p>is the quadratic penalty term for accelerating the convergence velocity.</p><p>To address this problem, the Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> is adopted to find the saddle point of the augmented Lagrangian. In accordance with ADMM optimization approach, the u k and ω k can be updated in two directions to realize the analysis process of VMD, and the following iterative solutions are obtained:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u n+1 k = arg min u k L ({ u n+1 i&lt;k } , { u n+1 i≥k } , { ω n i } , { λ n })<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">ω n+1 k = arg min ω k L ({ u n+1 i } , { ω n+1 i&lt;k } , { ω n i≥k } , { λ n })<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">λ n+1 = λ n + τ ( f (t) - K ∑ k=1 u n+1 k )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>the condition of convergence is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">∑ K k=1   u n+1 k -u n k   2 2 /   u n k   2 2 &lt; ε,</formula><p>where n represents the number of iterations and τ is the time step of the dual ascent. Consequently, the solutions for u k and ω k are expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ûn+1 k = f (ω) - ∑ i̸ =k ûi (ω) + λ(ω) 2 1 + 2α(ω -ω k ) 2<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">ω n+1 k = ∫ ∞ 0 ω ⏐ ⏐ ûn+1 k (ω) ⏐ ⏐ 2 dω ∫ ∞ 0 ⏐ ⏐ ûn+1 k (ω) ⏐ ⏐ 2 dω (7)</formula><p>where f (ω), λ(ω), ûi (ω), ûn+1 k are the Fourier transforms of f (ω), λ(ω), u i (ω), u n+1 k respectively. The complete procedure of VMD can be illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>

The network structure of RNN is similar to that of multilayer perception, whereas it employs cyclical or recurrent connections which use previous hidden node state as input, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The internal connections between hidden nodes enable information to travel forward or backward, so the output of a single RNN cell can be described as a function of previous RNN state and the input layer. In principle, the recurrent architecture can map the whole historical input data to every output, and this plays a crucial role in the accurate prediction of time sequences.</p><p>Despite the good performance that traditional RNN exhibits in complex time series modeling problem, there is still a fly in  the ointment. On one hand, it is difficult to find the best time lag namely time window size automatically to learn the temporal series processing. On the other hand, due to the long chains of operators introduced by recurrent connections, the gradient of RNN may decay exponentially or grow catastrophically during training when handing long-term dependencies of data, leading to the well-known vanishing gradients problem and exploring gradients problem. In consequence, traditional simple RNN may not be the ideal method for long-term forecasting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Long short-term memory network</head><p>To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of traditional RNN, LSTM network was proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidedhuber in 1997 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.

Due to the different features of different metal markets, these three data series have remarkably different fluctuation characteristics, therefore these three data series adopted in this paper can comprehensively and systematically evaluate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed model. In particular, the time span for each price is from June 02, 2006 to March 21, 2019 excluding public holidays, with a total of 3248 daily observations. The data from June 02, 2006 to December 30, 2016 is used for model training (2862 observations), and the remainder is used as the  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Performance evaluation criteria</head><p>It is important to apply multiple performance measures when assessing the forecasting ability of the developed model. This paper adopts two types of criteria for evaluation of level prediction and directional forecasting. For level prediction accuracy, MAE, MAPE and RMSE are utilized. Among the three statistical measures, MAE is the mean absolute error, MAPE is the mean absolute percentage error, and RMSE is the root mean squared error. The detailed computational formulas are respectively expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">MAE = 1 m m ∑ t=1 |R t -P t | (15) MAPE = 1 m m ∑ t=1 ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ R t -P t R t ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ (16) RMSE =    √ 1 m m ∑ t=1 (R t -P t ) 2 (17)</formula><p>where R t represents the real value for timestamp t, P t represents the corresponding predicted value, and m is the number of predicted results. Apparently, smaller values of these criteria indicate better forecasting performance.</p><p>For directional forecasting accuracy, the capacity of predicting correct direction is more important from the economical point of view. And it can be measured by directional statistic D stat , typically defined by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">18</ref>) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">D stat = 1 m m ∑ t=1 a t × 100% a t = { 1, (R t+1 -R t )(P t+1 -R t ) ≥ 0 0, otherwise<label>(18)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Data decomposition and parameter setting</head><p>In the proposed VMD-LSTM model, VMD is executed to disaggregate the raw price series into several modes to reduce the non-stationary and non-linear characteristics, thus makes them easy to be predicted. Before the implementation of decomposition by VMD, the number of components K needs to be predetermined. If K is too small, the original series may not be decomposed sufficiently and it causes inaccurate prediction. On the other side, if the signal is over-decomposed, the difference between each component becomes very small, and it gives rise to accuracy reduction and unnecessary computing overheads. To identify the optimal mode number, the ratio of residual energy r res to the original signal energy is introduced. Here, the r res can be defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">r res = 1 M M ∑ t=1 ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ f (t) - ∑ K k=1 u k (t) f (t) ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ (19)</formula><p>where f (t) is the original price series, u k (t) is the individual component, and M is the sample number. Since r res is residual error after decomposition, hence it can be applied as an optimization index in the VMD procedure. Empirically, when r res is less than 1% and there is no significant downward trend, the component </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>K</head><p>Zinc price series (r res ,%)</p><p>Copper price series (r res ,%)</p><p>Aluminum price series (r res ,%)  <ref type="table">1</ref>, all r res are below 1%. Moreover, when K is greater than 20, the trend of descending inclines to be stable. Taking into account the computational cost, the suitable value of K is taken as 20. Applying VMD to the price series, the subseries of different data are shown in Figs. 6 to 8 respectively. Apparently, these extracted subsequences are smoother and more regular than the original data, which is conductive to the improvement of the forecasting accuracy. The subseries with relatively lower frequency represent the whole tendency of the raw price series, and the higher frequency subseries reflect the local volatility tendency.</p><p>After the decomposition of price series, the next task is to construct a forecasting model for each subsequence generated by VMD. In this work, LSTM network is employed for the prediction of each subsequence. We use Keras to build LSTM network, which consists of an input layer, a LSTM layer and an output layer. For the input layer, the step size is set as 30, namely using the data from the first 30 days to predict the price of next day. The number of hidden layer neurons is determined as 256, by trial-and-error method, and the sigmoid function is chosen as the activation function. The learning rate and the batch size are set as the default value of 0.01 and 8, and the maximum number of training equals to 100.</p><p>For the purpose of analyzing the prediction performance of the VMD-LSTM model, we compare it with other baseline models, such as ARIMA, FNN, LSTM, EMD-FNN, EMD-LSTM and VMD-FNN. For ARIMA model, the optimal values of parameter p, d, q are determined based on the Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC). As to FNN (I-H-O), there is one neuron in each of the input and output layer. By the grid search (GS) algorithm, the hidden nodes H is set to 100, and the model runs 5000 times iteratively with the same learning rate of 0.01 for training. It should be noted that all of the simulations are implemented in Python 3.x running on an Intel @ Core TM i7-7700HQ processor operating at 3.40 GHz with a 16.00 GB installed RAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Empirical results and analysis</head><p>Some experiment results are presented in this section to verify the efficiency of the proposed VMD-LSTM model. Based on the above settings, testing experiments are conducted on three typical non-ferrous metals price data of Zinc, Copper and Aluminum. In the following, the accuracy evaluation indices are used to analyze the forecasting performance of these models. Figs. 9 to 12 display the evaluation criteria comparison of different forecasting models for Zinc, Copper and Aluminum. Take Zinc price as example, it is clearly seen from the histograms that, regardless of level prediction indices (MAE, MAPE, RMSE) or the directional forecasting index (D stat ), the VMD-LSTM model has the best prediction performance among all forecasting models. In particular, for the typical single model forecasting methods, they perform similarly in deviation error of the prediction results, but ARIMA model has a higher accuracy in direction prediction. Furthermore, compared with single model methods, hybrid models based on ''Decomposition-and-Ensemble'' framework have excellent prediction result, and they can improve the forecasting performance of single model considerably.</p><p>Besides that, in the hybrid models, the VMD-based prediction models outperform the models which use EMD decomposition method. It can be concluded that the VMD decomposition technique is superior to EMD. After decomposition, the hybrid models which utilize LSTM network as the prediction core generally outperform those with FNN as the predictor, and the superiorities of LSTM network for time series processing are reflected. As expected, the evaluations of Copper and Aluminum prices show a similar situation, and the methods considered have certain robustness and applicability.</p><p>For a quantitative analysis of the prediction results, the evaluation indices of different models aforementioned for different price data are listed in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2 to 4</ref>. Similarly, the price of Zinc is discussed as an example. The deviation error evaluation criteria MAE, MAPE, RMSE of VMD-LSTM model are 3.77, 0.11% and 4.79  respectively, which are significantly smaller than those of other forecasting models. As for the accuracy of direction prediction, the value of D stat of VMD-LSTM is 96.26% which is the largest among all models, namely the VMD-LSTM model has the best forecasting effect. For the three single model prediction methods  of ARIMA, FNN and LSTM, since the original price series fluctuate drastically, vary widely and change irregularly as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, the complex characteristics such as non-linearity and nonstationarity are very obvious, and the single model methods generally do not perform well. They perform similarly on the three deviation error criteria of MAE, MAPE and RMSE. However, on D stat , the values of ARIMA, FNN and LSTM are 76.28%, 47.87% and 53.72% respectively. The performance of ARIMA is better than those based on neural network.</p><p>Furthermore, by comparing FNN with EMD-FNN and VMD-FNN, LSTM with EMD-LSTM and VMD-LSTM, it is shown that hybrid models are superior to single model prediction methods in all cases. This may be ascribed to the fact that since the original signal fluctuates violently and varies dramatically, it is difficult to extract and analyze the variation law by using a single model directly, and it is usually hard to obtain satisfactory forecasting results. After the mode decomposition of the original signal, the decomposed subsequences are more stable and the period is relatively more regular. The interference and coupling between different scales feature information in the original data are reduced, which makes it easier to obtain the characteristics of the original series, including both linear and non-linear characteristics, thus lightening the burden and difficulty of the prediction Hence, the hybrid model on decomposition is considerably improved compared to the single model approach.</p><p>In the hybrid models, no matter what the prediction core is in the model, it is clearly that the VMD-based models outperform the EMD-based models. The possible reasons for the better performance of VMD could be summarized in the following three aspects: (1) VMD is less sensitive to noisy data unlike EMD decomposition method; (2) VMD has better decomposition adaptability, and the residual noise in each component is very small, which can provide deeper decomposition subseries; (3) Compared with EMD, VMD is capable of obtaining a large number of similar frequency subseries, and it can reveal the characteristics of each component more integrally. Overall, VMD overcomes the problems of model aliasing, noise sensitivity, boundary effects, etc. in EMD, and has a better decomposition effect, so the improvement of prediction accuracy is more remarkable. For the predictor, as can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, LSTM has certain advantages over FNN no matter which decomposition method is used, and it may be attributed to the following reasons: For traditional FNN, the key restriction affecting its prediction performance is the acyclic nature. All inputs and outputs are independent of each other, and this is not ideal for modeling time series that are highly correlated. In addition, FNN is greatly influenced by hyperparameters, and is prone to local minimum and overfitting, so the generalization ability is usual poor <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. LSTM is one of the most powerful models for processing temporal data, and it replaces the hidden layer neurons in FNN with memory cells and forms the structure of information circulation. Therefore, LSTM can effectively associate the historical information with current input data, thereby can capture the dynamic characteristics of data with high accuracy. Because VMD and LSTM have unique advantages in signal decomposition and time series processing, based on the successful combination of the two algorithms, the proposed VMD-LSTM model has the best forecasting results among all the models considered. As expected, the aforementioned change laws are basically the same in the price predictions of Copper and Aluminum, reflecting the robustness of the prediction models.</p><p>In order to show the forecasting effects of different models more intuitively, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref> describes the prediction of the prices of Zinc, Copper and Aluminum. Since the price series of non-ferrous metals fluctuate widely as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, in order to increase the discrimination of different models to have a better representation, we analyze the prediction error between the predicted value and the real value of each model. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref> shows the prediction error of all hybrid models and typical single model LSTM from January 01, 2017 to March 31, 2017. Specially, the prediction error of single model varies dramatically with a wide range of fluctuations, and the forecasting accuracy is significantly lower than those of the hybrid prediction models. After decomposition, the prediction models have a significant forecasting promotion. Although the price fluctuations and variations of different metal prices vary, as can be seen from the figures, all the curves of predicted results of hybrid models are roughly approximating the real values. In addition, the prediction errors of VMD-based models are smaller than those of the EMD-based method, and LSTM network has certain advantages over FNN. For all price series, the prediction errors of VMD-LSTM are basically distributed around zero with a small scale, namely the proposed model has a satisfactory forecasting result.</p><p>In particular, the runtime of all forecasting models on different data is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> to facilitate analysis of the computational complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> of the algorithms. All results are average over 10 interdependent realizations. As can be seen from the table, the runtime of LSTM in the single model methods is relatively long for all price data, and the computational complexity of decomposition-based hybrid forecasting model is higher than that of the single model. Obviously, the proposed method has the largest computational cost among the models considered as the average runtime of a VMD-LSTM model is about 21 s. Nevertheless, the real-time demand of price forecasting in practical applications is not high, the computational cost will rarely be prioritized. On the other hand, with the development of hardware computing power as well as the application of parallel computing technology, the runtime of the proposed method will be decrease in the future. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>Non-ferrous metals are pivotal industrial raw materials, and the changes in price impact the operation of enterprises even the national economy. In an attempt to improve the forecasting accuracy of non-ferrous metals price, this paper proposed a novel VMD-LSTM forecasting model. Here, the VMD method as a powerful signal processing technique is utilized to decompose the original price series into a group of subseries for reducing the instability of the raw data, the LSTM network is employed to build forecasting models for each independent component, and the individual forecasting results of each subseries are aggregated to an ensemble result. To investigate the forecasting performance of the proposed model, testing experiments are carried out on the daily data of Zinc, Copper and Aluminum from LME, and ARIMA, FNN, LSTM, EMD-FNN, EMD-LSTM and VMD-FNN are utilized for comparison. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed VMD-LSTM model outperforms other stateof-the-art methods in all evaluation criteria. Since the proposed method takes the irregular feature and interdependence of timeseries data into account, it is a promising methodology and can be extensively applied to other forecasting fields.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
