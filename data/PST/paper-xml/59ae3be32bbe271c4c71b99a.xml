<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper considers pilot design to mitigate pilot contamination and provide good service for everyone in multi-cell Massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. Instead of modeling the pilot design as a combinatorial assignment problem, as in prior works, we express the pilot signals using a pilot basis and treat the associated power coefficients as continuous optimization variables. We compute a lower bound on the uplink capacity for Rayleigh fading channels with maximum ratio detection that applies with arbitrary pilot signals. We further formulate the max-min fairness problem under power budget constraints, with the pilot signals and data powers as optimization variables. Because this optimization problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard due to signomial constraints, we then propose an algorithm to obtain a local optimum with polynomial complexity. Our framework serves as a benchmark for pilot design in scenarios with either ideal or non-ideal hardware. Numerical results manifest that the proposed optimization algorithms are close to the optimal solution obtained by exhaustive search for different pilot assignments and the new pilot structure and optimization bring large gains over the stateof-the-art suboptimal pilot design.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The demands on capacity and reliability in wireless cellular networks are continuously increasing. It is known that multiple input multiple output (MIMO) techniques can improve both capacity and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, but current systems only support up to eight antennas per base station (BS). While codebook-based channel acquisition is attractive in such small-scale MIMO systems, these methods are not scalable and unable to support the fifth generation (5G) demands on spectral efficiency (SE) in non-line-of-sight conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Massive MIMO was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> as a possible solution and it has emerged as a key 5G technology, because it offers significant improvements in both SE and energy efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. By equipping the BSs with hundreds of antennas, mutual interference, thermal noise, and small-scale fading can be almost eliminated by virtue of the channel hardening and favorable propagation properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The BSs only need to use linear detection schemes, such as maximum ratio (MR) or zero forcing, to achieve nearly optimal performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In addition, the SE only depends on the large-scale fading</p><p>The authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Linköping University, SE-581 83 Linköping, Sweden (email: trinh.van.chien@liu.se; emil.bjornson@liu.se; erik.g.larsson@liu.se).</p><p>This paper was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 641985 (5Gwireless). It was also supported by ELLIIT and CENIIT.</p><p>Parts of this paper were presented at IEEE ICC 2017.</p><p>coefficients, thus power control algorithms are easier to deploy than in small-scale MIMO systems, which are greatly affected by small-scale fading <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The uplink (UL) detection and downlink precoding in Massive MIMO are based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which the BSs obtain from UL pilot signals.</p><p>Mutually orthogonal pilots are desirable, but this is impractical in multi-cell scenarios since the pilot overhead would be proportional to the total number of users in the entire system. The consequence is that the pilot signals need to be reused across cells. This leads to pilot contamination <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, where users sending the same pilot degrade each others channel estimation and cause large mutual interference. Hence, the pilot design is of key importance in Massive MIMO and should be optimized to mitigate the pilot contamination effects.</p><p>The baseline scheme for mitigating pilot contamination is to introduce a pilot reuse factor f , such that each pilot is only reused in 1/ f of the cells. This approach, which was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, can greatly reduce the pilot contamination, even if the pilots are randomly assigned within each cell. However, this gain comes at the cost of using f times more pilots than in a system reusing the pilots in every cell. For any given cell, only a few users in the neighboring cells cause most of the potential pilot contamination, thus it is most important that these potential contaminators are assigned different pilots from the users in the given cell. Algorithms for coordinated pilot assignment were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. A pilot reuse dictionary was defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and the corresponding pilot assignment problem was shown to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard), which motivates the design of heuristic assignment mechanisms. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed several greedy algorithms, the optimized SE was far from that with exhaustive search over all pilot assignments. Graph theory was used for pilot assignment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, by exploiting variations in the large-scale fading coefficients. A method called "smart pilot assignment" was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> to enhance the max-min fairness SE level, by optimizing a heuristic mutual interference metric. Alternatively, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> formulated the pilot assignment problem as a potential game. The numerical results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> show performance that is similar to an exhaustive search, but with a substantially lower computational complexity. Moreover, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> utilized particular channel properties to reduce channel estimation errors and mitigate pilot contamination. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> utilized the orthogonality among different channels and an assumed lowrankness of the channel covariance matrices. An adjustable phase shift pilot construction was suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> based on the relationship between channel correlations in the frequency domain and their power angle-delay spectrum. However, all these algorithms rely on the assumption of fixed pilot and data power.</p><p>The pilot and payload data powers are usually treated as constants in the Massive MIMO literature, but it is known from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> that the performance can be much improved by using the optimal power allocation, which balances the mutual interference levels. To improve the channel estimation quality, more power might also be assigned to the pilots than to the data transmissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. For single-cell systems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> showed that a pilot-data power imbalance is especially important for cell-edge users. Moreover, the power allocation that maximizes the sum SE is much different from the one that maximizes the max-min SE. Similar behaviors for multi-cell systems were observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> considered power optimization problems with pilot reuse factors. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work analyzes joint pilot design and power control in Massive MIMO systems.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a novel pilot design and optimize the UL performance in multi-cell Massive MIMO systems, using the max-min fairness utility. Our main contributions are:</p><p>• We propose a new pilot design where the pilot signals are treated as continuous variables. We demonstrate that previous pilot designs are special cases of our proposal. For comparison the optimal solution by an exhaustive search of different pilot assignments is also investigated. • The proposed algorithms are evaluated numerically, with either ideal hardware or hardware impairments. The results show that our local solution is close to the global optimum by exhaustive search over different pilot assignments and demonstrate significant improvements over the heuristic algorithms in prior works. A preliminary version of this work, focusing only on pilot optimization with fixed data powers, was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents our proposed pilot structure and compares it with prior works. Lower bounds on the UL ergodic SE for arbitrary pilots are derived in Section III, while Section IV formulates the max-min fairness optimization problems and provides the global and local solutions. Sections V and VI extend our research to the case of hardware impairments and correlated Rayleigh fading, respectively. Finally, Section VII gives extensive numerical results and some conclusions are provided in Section VIII.</p><p>Notations: Lower bold letters are used for vectors and upper cases are for matrices.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PILOT DESIGNS FOR MASSIVE MIMO SYSTEMS</head><p>We consider the UL of a multi-cell Massive MIMO system with L cells. Each cell consists of a BS equipped with M antennas that serves K single-antenna users. All tuples of cell and user indices belong to a set S defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = {(i, t) : i ∈ {1, . . . , L}, t ∈ {1, . . . , K }} .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The radio channels vary over time and frequency. We divide the time-frequency plane into coherence intervals, each containing τ c samples, such that the channel between each user and each BS is static and frequency flat. In each coherence block, the pilot signaling utilizes τ p symbols and the remaining is dedicated to data transmission. In this paper, we focus on the UL, so the fraction (1 -τ p /τ c ) of the coherence interval is dedicated to UL data transmission. However, it is straightforward to extend our work to the downlink by using time division duplex (TDD) and channel reciprocity. We assume 1 ≤ τ p &lt; τ c to keep the training process feasible and stress that the case τ p &lt; K L is of practical importance since it gives rise to pilot contamination and since L is large in practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Proposed Pilot Design</head><p>Let us denote the τ p mutually orthonormal basis vectors {φ φ φ 1 , . . . , φ φ φ τ p }, where φ φ φ b ∈ C τ p is a vector whose bth element has unit magnitude, and all other elements are equal to zero.

We aim at designing a pilot signal collection {ψ ψ ψ 1,1 , . . . , ψ ψ ψ L,K } comprising the K L pilot signals used by all users in the network and each of them has the length of τ p symbols. The pilot signal of user k</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">in cell l is ψ ψ ψ l,k = [ψ 1 l,k , . . . , ψ τ p l,k ] T ∈ C τ p</formula><p>and the power that this user assigns to the bth pilot basis is denoted as pb l,k ≥ 0. Thus, the pilot of user k in cell l is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ψ ψ ψ l,k = τ p b=1 pb l,k φ φ φ b , ∀l, k.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>We stress that the pilot construction in (3) can be used to create any set of τ p orthogonal pilot signals (up to a unitary transformation) and many different sets of non-orthogonal signals. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The total pilot power consumption utilized by user k</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">in cell l is ψ ψ ψ l,k 2 = τ p b=1</formula><p>pb l,k and we assume that it satisfies the power constraint</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">1 τ p τ p b=1 pb l,k ≤ P max,l,k , ∀l, k,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where P max,l,k is the maximum pilot power for user k in cell l.</p><p>The inner product of two pilot signals ψ ψ ψ l,k and ψ ψ ψ i,t is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ψ ψ ψ H l,k ψ ψ ψ i,t = τ p b=1 pb l,k pb i,t .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>These pilot signals are orthogonal if the product is zero, which only happens when they allocate their powers to different subsets of basis vectors. Otherwise, they are non-orthogonal and then the two users cause pilot contamination to each other.</p><p>If the square roots of the powers allocated to the K users in cell l are gathered in matrix form as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P P P l =                p1 l,1 p1 l,2 • • • p1 l,K p2 l,1 p2 l,2 • • • p2 l,K . . . . . . . . . . . . pτ p l,1 pτ p l,2 • • • pτ p l,K                ∈ R τ p ×K + ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>then the users in cell l utilize a pilot matrix defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Ψ l = [ψ ψ ψ l,1 , . . . , ψ ψ ψ l,K ] = Φ Φ ΦP P P l .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We now describe the difference between this new pilot structure and the prior works, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Other Pilot Designs</head><p>The works <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> considered the assignment of τ p orthogonal pilot signals under the assumption of fixed equal pilot power. Using our notation, the pilot matrix in cell l is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Ψ Ψ Ψ l = [ ψ ψ ψ l,1 , . . . , ψ ψ ψ l,K ] = pΦ Φ ΦΠ Π Π l ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where 0 &lt; p ≤ τ p P max,l,k is the equal power level of all users. Π Π Π l ∈ R τ p ×K + is a permutation matrix, that assigns the pilot signals to each user in cell l. The assignment is optimized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> to minimize a heuristic mutual interference metric. Note that these works assume orthogonal pilot signals and equal power allocation, which are simplifications compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. These assumptions are generally suboptimal. Apart from this, the selection of the optimal permutation matrices for cell l is a combinatorial problem, so to limit the computational complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and the references therein only study the special case of τ p = K.</p><p>The previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> optimized the pilot powers to maximize functions of the SE, but the paper only considered a single cell without pilot contamination. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> optimized the pilot powers to minimize the UL transmit power for a multi-cell system. This work assumed τ p = K and a fixed pilot assignment. If pl,k is the pilot power of user k in cell l, the square root of the power matrix allocated to the K users in cell l is a diagonal matrix defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P P P l = diag pl,1 , . . . , pl,K ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where diag(x) denotes the diagonal matrix with the vector x on the diagonal. The pilot matrix in cell l is then formulated as Ψ l = Φ Φ Φ P P P l .</p><p>Similar to (4), the pilot power at user k in cell l is limited as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">0 ≤ pl,k ≤ τ p P max,l,k .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Since orthogonal pilots and fixed pilot assignment are assumed, this is also a special case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. We can combine the pilot structure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and the idea of selecting a permutation matrix in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> to jointly optimize the power allocation and pilot assignment. In particular, the pilot signals of the users in cell l are now defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Ψl = [ ψ ψ ψ l,1 , . . . , ψ ψ ψ l,K ] = Φ Φ Φ P P P l Π Π Π l .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>This modified pilot design is a special case of (7) and has not been studied in prior works, but will be considered herein.</p><p>In order to analyze the channel estimation, we define a pilot reuse set P l,k including all tuples of cell and user indices that cause pilot contamination to user k in cell l:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P l,k = {(i, t) ∈ S : ψ ψ ψ H i,t ψ ψ ψ l,k 0}. (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>We stress that designing an exhaustive search to obtain the best pilot assignment strategy is extremely computationally expensive. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> As in prior works, we only consider the case τ p = K when using <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and we further assume that orthogonal pilots are used within each cell; that is, P l,k ∩ P l,k = ∅ for any user indices k k in cell l. To perform an exhaustive search, we need to construct a dictionary D, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, with all the possible combinations of pilot assignments in the network. Let χ k l ∈ {1, . . . , K } denote the index of the pilot signal assigned to user k in cell l. It follows that χ k l χ k l for k k since all users within a cell use different pilots.

Channel Estimation with Arbitrary Pilots</head><p>During the UL pilot transmission, the received signal Y l ∈ C M×τ p at the BS of cell l is</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Y l = (i,t) ∈S h l i,t ψ ψ ψ H i,t + N l ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where h l i,t ∈ C M denotes the channel between user t in cell i and BS l.

PILOT OPTIMIZATION FOR CELLULAR MASSIVE MIMO SYSTEMS WITH HARDWARE IMPAIRMENTS</head><p>The previous sections considered Massive MIMO with ideal transceiver hardware. However practical transceivers are nonideal in the sense of creating distortions that can have a substantial impact on the SE. Thanks to the non-coherent combining of the independent distortion caused at each of the BS antennas, the hardware impairments at the BS can be neglected in Massive MIMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. However, the distortion caused by the single-antenna users leads to coherent self-interference, which can be viewed as pilot contamination that the user causes to itself. The pilot optimization problem is fundamentally different when accounting for self-interference, because pilot contamination from distant users can now be neglected when it is substantially weaker than the self-interference. In this section, we investigate how the distortions from hardware impairments at the users affect the proposed pilot design and the optimization problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we use numerical simulations to quantify and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed pilot designs, using the exact closed-form expressions of the SE in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_42">31</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_46">34</ref>), (58), and (65). A Massive MIMO system with a coverage area 1 km 2 comprising of four square cells is considered. In each cell, a BS is located at the center, while the K users are uniformly distributed at distance not closer to the BS than 35 m. To even out interference, the coverage area is wrapped around, and therefore one BS has neighbors. The coherence interval contains 200 symbols and the system bandwidth is 20 MHz. The noise variance is -96 dBm. We deploy the 3GPP LTE model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> where the large-scale fading coefficient</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">β l i,t [dB] is β l i,t = -148.1 -37.6 log 10 d l i,t + z l i,t ,<label>(70)</label></formula><p>where, d l i,t denotes the distance in km between user t in cell i and BS l. The shadow fading z l i,t has a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and the standard derivation 7 dB. 8  The maximum pilot and data power constraints are P max,l,k = P d max,l,k = 200 mW, ∀l, k.</p><p>For Algorithm 2 and its modification with fixed data power (which was considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>), we observe better performance with a hierarchical initialization of p b, (0) l,k than with an all-equal initialization. Consequently, we initialize p b, (0) l,k as uniformly distributed over the range [0; P max,l,k ]. 9 Algorithm 2 converges quite fast, so the stopping criteria was specified in number of iterations (e.g., 15 iterations). The proposed algorithms are compared with related works and exhaustive search:</p><p>(i) Random pilot assignment, as considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The same pilots are reused in every cell and assigned randomly to the users within the cell. Equal pilot and data powers of 200 mW are used by all users. This method is denoted as Random P. assignment in the figures. (ii) Smart pilot assignment, as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Orthogonal pilots are assumed within a cell and reused in every cell. They are assigned to the users based on the mutual interference information, determined by the large-scale fading coefficients. Equal pilot and data powers 200 mW are used by all users. This method is denoted as Smart P. assignment in the figures. (iii) Pilot power optimization with exhaustive search, as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, utilizes the pilot structure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and the optimal solution to the max-min SE is obtained by a 8 Shadow fading realizations were sometimes regenerated to ensure that the home BS has the largest large-scale fading to its users (i.e., β l l, k is the maximum over all β l i, k , i = 1, . . . , L). This makes sure that the coverage area of each BS is a square also with shadow fading, while retaining the macro-diversity towards shadow fading that exists in practice. 9 The maximum power settings indicate relatively low median SNRs at the cell-edge users of the network. modification of Algorithm 1 with fixed data powers of p l,k = 200 mW at all users. This method is denoted as P. opt. w. exhaustive in the figures. (iv) Joint pilot and data power optimization with exhaustive search utilizes the pilot structure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and the optimal solution to the max-min SE is obtained as shown in Algorithm 1. This method is denoted as P&amp;D opt. w. exhaustive in the figures. (v) Proposed pilot optimization with full data power, as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, utilizes the pilot structure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and the local optimum to the max-min SE is obtained by a modification of Algorithm 2 with fixed data powers of p l,k = 200 mW at all users. This method is denoted as Pro. P. opt. w. full D. power in the figures. (vi) Proposed joint pilot and data power optimization utilizes the pilot structure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and the local optimum to the max-min SE is obtained as shown in Algorithm 2. This method is denoted as Pro. P&amp;D opt. in the figures.</p><p>The SE is measured over different random user locations and shadow fading realizations. The SE achieved by (i)-(iv) are also averaged over different pilot reuse locations, while for (v) and (vi) the SE is also averaged over different initializations of pb,(0) l,k , ∀l, k, b. The solutions to the optimization problems are obtained by utilizing the MOSEK solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> in CVX <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the cumulative distribution  function (CDF) of the max-min SE level [b/s/Hz] for the case K = τ p = 2 and M = 300. Random pilot assignment yields the worst performance due to the pilot contamination and mutual interference. At the 95%-likely point, smart pilot assignment brings significant improvements: it is about 6.86× better since it attempts to reduce the mutual interference between the users <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Although the performance of smart pilot assignment is very close to optimal pilot assignment with exhaustive search for a predetermined pilot power level <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, by jointly optimizing power and allocation of the pilot signals, the proposed method outperforms smart pilot assignment by providing an additional 1.53× gain in average max-min SE. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> also demonstrates the superiority of jointly optimizing both data and pilot powers. It yields 1.86× higher average SE than optimizing only the pilots. Furthermore, the similar performance between the proposed pilot and exhaustive search confirms the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for finding locally optimal solutions. The proposed approach for joint optimization pilot and data power on average achieves 84% of the SE with the optimal solution, with a substantially lower computational complexity. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> plots the CDF of power allocated to each pilot/data symbol with K = τ p = 2 and M = 300. We do not include random pilot assignment and smart pilot assignment because they consume full power 200 mW. We observe a vast energy saving for the remaining methods. For the pilot and data power control with exhaustive search, the power consumption on pilot signaling is on average only 111 mW. The proposed design without data power control, each pilot symbol on average only spends 50 mW. In comparison to the previous pilot design (e.g., the max-min SE in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and the corresponding power consumption in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), we conclude that the proposed pilot structure can reduce the transmit power more significantly than the prior works while producing better max-min SE. This is because the prior works mitigate pilot contamination by assigning the orthogonal pilot signals to the users; that is, each user assigns power to only one of the basis vectors. In contrast, our design allows for non-orthogonal pilot signals with increasing feasible domain to minimize the total coherent interference in the network. By counting 95% of the pilot energy, the average number of non-zero pilot symbols in each pilot signal is on average about 1.02 and 1.32 for τ p = K = 2 and τ p = K = 4, respectively. Hence, some users have non-orthogonal pilots. The pilot power optimization with exhaustive search has a computational complexity that grows exponentially in K. When increasing the number of users, we henceforth only compare the three pilot designs: proposed pilot design, smart pilot assignment, and random pilot assignment. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> displays the max-min SE as a function of the number of users and pilots with M = 300, K = τ p . Our proposed design yields the highest performance among the related algorithms. Specifically, in comparison to random pilot assignment, the improvement varies from 2.39× with K = τ p = 2 to 4.58×  with K = τ p = 8. Even smart pilot assignment also performs much better than random pilot assignment, our proposed scheme provides substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art (e.g., we gain 1.72× with K = τ p = 8 for fixed data power). The figure also demonstrates a significant improvement with jointly optimizing pilot and data power for all the tested cases of the user and pilot number. In comparison to the case of only optimizing the pilots, the performance gain is from 1.87× to 4.01× as the number of users and pilots increases from 2 to 8. In addition, we observe a dramatic reduction of the max-min SE of all the pilot designs when the number of users increases due to stronger mutual interference. to Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the performances of the different pilot designs and power control algorithms are about the same for large numbers of users.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the max-min SE in the network as a function of the number of BS antennas. Among the three pilot structures, we still observe the worst performance with random pilot assignment, for which the max-min SE only increases from 0.10 [b/s/Hz] to 0.23 [b/s/Hz], when the number of antennas increases from 100 to 900 antennas. Our proposed pilot design obtains better performance than smart pilot assignment and the gap grows as more antennas BSs are added. For example, with 100 BS antennas, the smart pilot assignments yields a max-min SE 0.20 [b/s/Hz], while optimizing pilot signaling for fixed data powers gives 0.27 [b/s/Hz] and the joint optimization of pilot and data powers yields 1.18 [b/s/Hz]. The max-min SE is respectively 0.60, 1.08, and 2.12 [b/s/Hz] for the three methods when the BSs are equipped with 900 antennas. Hence the proposed pilot structure is especially suitable for Massive MIMO systems with the large ratios M/K. Moreover, due to the pilot contamination, a saturation of the SE at about 2.10 [b/s/Hz] is observed with the proposed joint optimization of and data powers. Only the special case K = τ p has been investigated so far due to the high computational complexity of the pilot assignments from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In contrast, our algorithms can be applied for arbitrary lengths of the pilots. This is demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, which displays the max-min SE as a function of the length of the pilot signals. We observe noticeable gains when the pilot length increases for both (v) and (vi). For instance, when the pilot length per coherence interval increases from 1 to 19, we observe a gain up to 12.17× with the proposed joint pilot and data power optimization. Moreover, the pilot signals with lengths τ p &gt; K L still bring an increasing SE since it produces better channel estimation quality. However the gain is not significant, and therefore τ p = K L is a good choice to eliminate pilot contamination and maximize the minimum SE if we have enough time-frequency resources.</p><p>The impact of hardware impairments is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Increasing the impairment level leads to a decrease in max-min SE, but the reduction is not dramatic since we are operating at low SE where the performance is already interference limited, so the additional self-interference has no dominant impact. When the impairment level reaches 0.2, there is only a reduction of about 15.04%, 16.51%, 18.88%, and 28.87% for random pilot assignment, smart pilot assignment, proposed pilot design with full data power, and proposed joint pilot and data power optimization respectively. This impairment level is hardly found in practice. For a more realistic impairment level of = 0.1, the reduction only varies from 3.61% to 7.27%. Furthermore that hardware impairments reduce more the performance of the algorithms giving higher SEs. Finally, we stress that our proposed algorithms provide substantial performance gains also under hardware impairments.</p><p>Motivated by the fact that practical channels may be spatially correlated, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> shows the max-min SE of the pilot design (please refer to Section VI for the analysis) where the channel between user i in cell t and BS l is modeled by using the exponential correlation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.

The coefficient magnitude ρ l i,t is in the range of [0, 1] and it equals 0.5 in our simulation. The figure demonstrates that our pilot design provides much higher max-min SE than the other pilot designs. Although the spatial correlation affects the user channels, the differences in SE are not significant compared to uncorrelated Rayleigh fading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposed a novel pilot design for cellular Massive MIMO systems and combines the pilot assignment and uplink power allocation into a unified optimization framework.</p><p>A key difference from prior work is that we treat the pilot signals as continuous optimization variables, instead of predefined vectors that should be assigned combinatorially. We used the proposed pilot structure to compute a new SE on the UL ergodic SE for Rayleigh fading channels with MR detection, both with ideal hardware and hardware impairments. A general max-min SE optimization problem was formulated. Although finding the globally optimal solution is NP-hard, we developed an algorithm that finds a local optimum that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms for pilot assignment and is close to the optimum obtained by the exhaustive search. The numerical results demonstrate the importance of jointly optimizing the pilots and transmit powers in order to improve the max-min SE.</p></div>

Thus, if ξ (i),opt is the optimal objective value of (48), then we obtain ξ (i+1),opt ≥ ξ (i),opt .
