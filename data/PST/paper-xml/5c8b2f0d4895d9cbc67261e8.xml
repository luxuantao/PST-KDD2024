<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE concept of "Energy Internet" is recently presented to meet the challenges of developing sustainable and environmentally friendly energy resources, hybrid energy utilization model, flexible energy management and secure system control. Several literatures about energy internet (EI), mainly focusing on system architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, energy router <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and voltage control <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, etc., have been proposed in recent years. Likewise, energy management problem (EMP), as one of fundamental issues in power system, is encouraged to be revisited to achieve the envisioned EI conception.</p><p>EMP is typically formulated as an optimization problem. A number of approaches have been proposed to solve the above problem and can be classified into two categories, i.e., centralized approaches and distributed approaches. With regard to centralized approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, they have the advantage in the aspect of obtaining the optimal solution. However, as the physical power system tends to become distributed, centralized approaches have to confront many challenges. Specifically, the centralized approaches, relying on a central controller, require high bandwidth communication capabilities to act on systemwide gathered information, resulting in high susceptibility to single-point failures and modeling errors. Moreover, either the physical or communication network of the future power grid is likely to have a variable topology, which may undermine the efficacy of the centralized approach. In addition, the distributed energy resources owners are generally unwilling to disclose their own information to the external centralized controller to protect their privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>On the contrary, the distributed approaches, with better robustness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, faster computation and less communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, are promising options for the future power system. A number of literatures, concerned about solving the EMP in a distributed manner, have been proposed for smart grid or microgrid recently, which can be classified into two main categories. The one, which does not consider the demand response, is also called economic dispatch problem (EDP), whose object is minimizing the total operating cost while meeting some equality and inequality constraints. From this prospective, the Î»-consensus algorithm has been firstly proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which can solve the traditional EDP in a fully distributed manner. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> has presented a new distributed algorithm which does not rely on the projection scheme and also can achieve the underlying power flow control. In order to address nonquadratic cost function, a distributed bisection method and a distributed algorithm based on projected gradient method have been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, respectively. Moreover, the ramping rate limits <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, transmission losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, finite-time <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, non-convex conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and frequency recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> have been further taken into consideration and studied in the EDP. The other one aims at maximizing the social welfare through the coordination of the suppliers' generations and customers' demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Since the demand response is taken into consideration, the power system operation becomes more flexible and economic.</p><p>Different from the studies above for the traditional system or smart grid, the EMP for EI is a relatively new but difficult problem, which will bring many challenges. On one hand, EI is a hybrid energy network with many new characteristics which can be summarized in three aspects. Firstly, EI integrates various kinds of energy networks. As the main energy medium, it is urgent for power, heat and gas flows to be coplanned. Secondly, each unit in EI can be not only an energy consumer but also an energy supplier. The form of energy generation and consumption are tending to be diversified. Thirdly, distributed energy suppliers or consumers within EI have peer-to-peer relationship, which is different from the traditional, vertical supply-demand relationship. The detailed features and requirements of EI will be discussed in section II-A. Therefore, how to establish a system model, which can describe aforementioned features of EI in a better way, is one of the major challenges. On another hand, EI should meet the plug-and-play nature and topology variabilities, etc. Thus, it is desirable to develop a distributed method to solve the EMP of EI. More importantly, different from smart grid, there exists strong coupling among power, heat and gas in the process of energy-generation, energy-conversion and energyconsumption for EI. Meanwhile, there also exist many global constraint limits and non-linear objective function. However, the existing distributed methods discussed above can not deal with this kind of distributed non-linear coupling optimization problem. Therefore, how to establish a fully distributed method to solve the EMP of EI is another major challenge.</p><p>To address above challenges, this paper focuses on the static EMP of the future EI considering multi-energy-networks and intermittency of renewable energy resources, where a novel distributed-consensus-ADMM algorithm is proposed to solve this problem in a fully distributed fashion. The major contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>1) The energy management framework is developed for the future EI featuring multiple couplings of different energy forms, diversified energy roles and peer-to-peer energy supply/ demand, etc. Subsequently, the energy body, seen as both energy supplier and customer, is presented for system model development.</p><p>2) Forecasting errors, confidence intervals and penalty factor are also considered to model renewable energy resource. With this effort, the optimality and generation possibility of the renewable energy can be traded off by designing the penalty on curtailment of renewable generation.</p><p>3) By dividing the global computation process into the distributed participants, our implementation fashion can make each participant locally calculate its optimal operation. It can result in enhanced reliability, flexibility and scalability, etc., and is more suitable for the future EI to integrate distributed multi-energy resources.</p><p>4) The proposed algorithm can effectively overcome the weakness of conventional distributed ADMM algorithm which assumes part of global information is known via designing a dynamic average consensus algorithm for estimating the global information. Moreover, the optimality and convergence analysis are strictly proved.</p><p>5) We get the explicit iterative form of coupled variables by transforming and decoupling the max-min problem, and make the coupled inequality constraints be solved by locally calculating sub-min problem. With this effort, the strongly power-heat-gas-coupling problem can be effectively solved by implementing the proposed algorithm.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II identifies the main features and requirements, and builds the model of the future EMP of EI. Section III firstly introduces some basic graph theory and then the distributed-consensus-ADMM algorithm is presented. In Section IV, several case studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Section V concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. ENERGY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK OF EI</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Structure and Features Analysis</head><p>The anticipated structure of EI, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, consists of various kinds of distributed energy suppliers and/or customers which are referred as energy bodies (EBs). Fed by multi-energy-carriers, the energy resources of each EB can be divided into four classes, i.e., power-only devices which contain an equivalent distributed renewable generator (DRG), distributed fuel generator (DFG) and distributed power storage device (DPSD), heat-only devices which contain an equivalent distributed renewable heating device (DRHD), distributed fuel heating device (DFHD) and distributed heat storage device (DHSD), an equivalent distributed combined heat and power (DCHP) device and an equivalent distributed gas producer (DGP). Meanwhile, the energy loads (ELs) of each EB can be divided into three classes, i.e., power load, heat load and gas load, in which every type of the load contains an equivalent controllable load and a must-run load. Note that each EB contains at least one type of energy resource or load which are connected to the corresponding energy bus. More importantly, the EB can be seen as small as a house or as large as a town based on the requirements of different scenarios. In order to achieve the anticipated EI, the major features and requirements of the proposed energy management framework of EI are summarized as follows:</p><p>1) As for EI, one of the features is to integrate multienergy-networks, such as electricity, transportation, nature gas, oil and heat networks, etc. Since power, gas and heat are the major energy that can be flexibly transferred and directly consumed, it is urgent that they can be co-managed and be the primary energy medium of energy-generation, energy-transmission and energy-consumption, which brings many advantages. For example, since there are many kinds of alternative energy resources in EI, consumers can diversify their energy supply mix and determine the amount of energy utilization in an overall optimal manner. This will create significant incentives to increase the consumer participation and put full use of the function of "virtual storage" caused by demand dispatch to flatten out the variability of energy generation. Moreover, The co-planning benefits improvement of the energy efficiency and economy and decreasing carbon emission, etc.</p><p>2) In the anticipated EI, each EB may be equipped with its own energy generation, conversion and storage devices and schedulable loads, so it plays a role of not only energy (i.e. power, heat and gas) supplier but also energy consumer. For example, a EB may be a power supplier and a heat consumer at the same time. Meanwhile, motivated by the Internet, each EB is also both the information supplier and information consumer, and they only exchange information with its neighbors through local network. Moreover, all EBs are cooperative to achieve the maximization of social welfare while meeting a set of local and global constraints. Then, each EB can determine its corresponding energy-production or/and energy-consumption. It is worth noting that each EB may compensate its self-energy-demand, and even make additional profit by selling the part of overabundance energy to other EB. In this case, it can be seen as an energy-supplier. Otherwise, it is seen as an energy consumer. In such an energy management framework, EB can somehow weaken dependency on utility grid and promote network flattening; meanwhile, there will be more interactions and flexibility among EBs. More importantly, driven by profit, it is able to create sufficient incentives for each EB to make self-installation of renewable energy resources, resulting in increased penetration of renewable energy resources.</p><p>3) To integrate and coordinate the large number EBs with the plug-and-play feature, both the physical and communication topology of EI are subject to variability and uncertainty. Therefore, it's imperative to develop a distributed control strategy, with decision made by the EBs themselves rather than a central controller. This also means that each EB should have the function of local information precessing and computing. The distributed implementation fashion benefits for enhancement of system reliability, flexibility for possible expansions of distributed energy resources, and scalability in terms of the computation and communications burden, etc. Moreover, in the proposed energy management framework, it achieves the vertical energy supply mode to peer-to-peer mode. To be specific, EBs have peer-to-peer relationship. The renewable and conventional fuel devices are in peer-topeer mode to accomplish their own function. In addition, the diversified energy resources, including electric power, gas and heat, are also in the peer-to-peer mode to collectively achieve their optimization, management and control.</p><p>From the discussion above, the major differences of EI and the smart grid on EMP are summarized as follows. Firstly, the smart grid mainly focuses on the optimization and management of electrical power on power system aspect, in which the electrical power is the major energy medium in the process of energy-generation, energy-conversion and energyconsumption. However, EI focuses on integrating various kinds of energy resources to fulfil the co-planning of different energy networks, which contains multi-type coupled energy mediums such as power, heat and gas. In addition, each energy network in EI is in peer-to-peer position to fulfil its functionalities. Secondly, each unit of smart grid can be only seen as an electrical power supplier or consumer in one scheduling horizon. On the contrast, the EB in EI, regarded as both energy supplier and consumer, can play multiple roles at the same time. Lastly but not least, both smart grid and EI are eager to develop distributed methods for the EMP. However, the strongly power-heat-gas coupling situation of EI, which exists in the objective function and constraint limits, vastly increases the solving difficulty and is more complicated than electricity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. System Model</head><p>1) DRG and DRHD models: For DRGs, the solar radiation and wind are the major energy sources with zero fuel cost. Thus, the direct cost of renewable generators is often the operating cost which is proportional to the produced power. It is worth noting that renewable generators cannot be regarded as dispatchable units due to the intermittency and randomness features. To take them into consideration in our EMP, the forecast technologies are used in this paper. The mean forecasting value, seen as the reference during each scheduling horizon, can be calculated from day-ahead forecast curve given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p re, â  ij,t = ( â« t+T t p re, â  ij, t d t) /(T ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where p re, â  ij, t is the forecasting power generation of jth DRG of ith EB at time t; T is the scheduling horizon. Note that real value may not be the forecasting value because of the forecast error. In this paper, it is assumed that the forecast error, denoted by âp re, â  ij,t , obeys Gaussian distribution whose feasibility analysis has been discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Then, the corresponding probability density function can be modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f ( âp re, â  ij,t ) = 1 â 2ÏÎ´ re ij,t exp ( - ( âp re, â  ij,t ) 2 / ( 2Î´ re ij,t ) 2 ) . (2)</formula><p>Furthermore, let the confidence level be 100(1 -â ij )%, then we can get the confidence intervals [p re, â ,down ij,t , p re, â ,up ij,t ] by using the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Therein, â ij denotes the corresponding significance level. In addition, we assume that the power generation of each DRG can be fully consumed by loads, then we can let</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p re ij,t = p re, â  ij,t + âp re, â  ij,t â p re ij,t â¤ p re ij,t â¤ p re ij,t ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where p re ij,t = p re, â ,down ij,t</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">+ p re, â  ij,t , p re ij,t = p re, â  ij,t + p re, â ,up ij,t</formula><p>, and p re ij,t is the power output of jth DRG of ith EB. Based on the above discussion, the cost function of DRG is modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C ( p re ij,t ) = b ij p re ij,t +Îµ ij exp ( Î³ ij p re ij,t -p re ij,t p re ij,t -p re ij,t ) , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where b ij &gt; 0 and Îµ ij &gt; 0 are the cost coefficients, Î³ ij &lt; 0 is the penalty factor. The first item of the above equation denotes the direct operating cost while the second one denotes the penalty on curtailment of renewable generation. The purpose and significance of (4) are discussed in Remark 1. In addition, the modeling process and cost function of DRHD are designed accordingly as for DRG. And let h re ij,t and C(h re ij,t ) denote the corresponding heat generation and cost function, respectively.</p><p>Remark 1: Compared with DFGs, the operating cost of each DRG is very small. As a result, from the viewpoint of optimization, it may tend to run at its corresponding upper bound, i.e., p re ij,t . However, the higher value the p re ij,t is calculated, the lower possibility the practical power generation has to meet this requirement. On the contrary, if the renewable generator runs at point p re ij,t , there is 100(1-â ij )% possibility to believe that its practical capability can meet this power output, but that may decrease the optimality. Thus, the exponential penalty on curtailment of renewable generation is designed to provide trade-off between the optimality and possibility. In this way, the DFG and DRG can be in the same form.</p><p>Based on the aforementioned discussions, the concept of the cost function model of DRGs is described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Further, a simple example is supplied to clearly illustrate the idea of (4). We consider a system composed of a DRG with direct operating cost C D (p re ) = 0.1095p re <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, a DFG with cost function C(p fe ) = 0.04(p fe ) 2 + 25p fe + 99 + 50 exp(0.01p fe ) (30(p.u.) â¤ p fe â¤ 150(p.u.)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and a must-run load L = 220 (p.u.). The confidence level and the forecasting value are respectively set as 90% and 93.90(p.u.), s.t., 84.3(p.u.) â¤ p re â¤ 103.5(p.u.). Before considering the penalty on curtailment of renewable generation, the goal is to minimize Goal = C D (p re ) + C(p fe ) while meeting the supply-demand balance constraint, i.e., p re + p fe = L, and the inequality constraints mentioned above. Since the direct operating cost is proportional to p re , the incremental cost of the DRG is a constant, i.e., 0.1095 which is very small compared to the one of DFG. The calculation results show that p re = 103.5(p.u.) and p fe =116.5(p.u.). In this version, although it can obtain better optimality or less cost, its corresponding possibility is very small. In other words, only when the real value is over 103.5(p.u.), the practical capability can meet this requirement. Note that the lower value of p re is, the higher possibility becomes. Thus, to guarantee possibility, we can let p re = 84.3(p.u.), resulting in decreased optimization. Different from the two cases, the exponential penalty on curtailment of renewable generation, set as 748 exp(-1.1 103.5 -p re 103.5 -84.3 ), is further taken into consideration. Then, the scheduling problem is re-calculated with results of p re = 125.19(p.u.) and p fe = 94.81(p.u.). From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, it can be seen that, after considering the penalty on curtailment, the incremental cost of DRG exponentially increases as the increasing of p re . It also means that the higher value of p re is, the greater penalty becomes. As a consequence, the optimality and possibility can be traded off in a suitable position, but not the upper or lower bound to unilaterally ensure the optimization or possibility only.</p><p>2) DFG, DFHD and DGP models: To deal with and investigate the ramping rate limits of DFGs, its discrete form is always formulated into a knapsack problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For DFG, its cost function is modeled as the following non-linear function <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">C ( p fe ij,t ) = a ij ( p f e ij,t ) 2 +b ij p f e ij,t +c ij +Îµ ij exp ( Î· ij p f e ij,t )<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">p f e,min ij,t â¤ p f e ij,t â¤ p f e,max ij,t<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">-p f e,ramp ij,t â¤ p f e ij,t -p f e ij,t-1 â¤ p f e,ramp ij,t ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where a ij , b ij , c ij , Îµ ij and Î· ij represent nonnegative cost coefficients which are derived from the energy emission of the thermal unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; p f e ij,t is the power output of jth DFG of ith EB; p f e,min ij,t and p f e,max ij,t are the lower and upper bounds; and p f e,ramp ij,t is the ramp rate limit. In addition, if the above DFG is a gas turbine, the amount of gas consumption, denoted by gas p ij,t , cannot exceed the gas transmission maximum capability denoted by gas p,max ij,t</p><p>. For a gas turbine, the relationship between power generation and the amount of gas consumption can be approximatively evaluated by the following equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">gas p ij,t =Î ( Âµ ij ( p f e ij,t ) 2 + Î½ ij p f e ij,t + Î¸ ij ) ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where Âµ ij , Î½ ij , Î¸ ij , Î¾ ij and Ï ij are heat rate coefficients. Î is the conversion ratio from MW to SCM/h, and the value of Î is about 84.</p><p>The model of DFG can be applied for DFHD. However, in different condition, the ramp rate limits of DFHDs are not taken into consideration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. And let h f e ij,t and C(h f e ij,t ) denote the corresponding heat generation and cost function, respectively. If the heating device is a gas boiler, the amount of gas consumption can be approximatively evaluated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">gas h ij,t = Î ( h f e ij,t /Î· f e ij,t ) , (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where Î· f e i,t is the efficiency. And we let gas h,max ij,t represent the gas transmission maximum capability.</p><p>Finally, the cost function of DGP is modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">C ( g g ij,t ) = a ij ( g g ij,t ) 3 + b ij ( g g ij,t ) 2 + d ij g g ij,t + c ij (10) 0 â¤ g g,min ij,t â¤ g g ij,t â¤ g g,max ij,t , (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where a ij , b ij , c ij and d ij are nonnegative cost coefficients; g g ij,t is the gas output of jth DGP of ith EB; and g g,min ij,t and g g,max ij,t are the corresponding lower and upper bounds. It is not difficult to verify that function <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> is convex in the region determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>3) DCHP model: The cost function of DCHP is often modeled as the following convex function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> C</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">( p chp ij,t , h chp ij,t ) =a ij ( p chp ij,t ) 2 + b ij p chp ij,t + Î± ij ( h chp ij,t ) 2 + Î² ij ( h chp ij,t ) + Ï ij p chp ij,t h chp ij,t + c ij (12) e ij,m p chp ij,t + f ij,m h chp ij,t + z ij,m â¥ 0, (m = 1, 2, 3, 4) (13) -p chp,ramp ij,t â¤ p chp ij,t -p chp ij,t-1 â¤ p chp,ramp ij,t , (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where is the ramp rate limit. If the DCHP unit is fed by nature gas, the total gas consumption can be approximatively evaluated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">a ij , b ij , Î± ij , Î² ij ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">gas chp ij,t = Î (( p chp ij,t + h chp ij,t ) /Î· chp ij,t ) , (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where Î· chp ij,t is the total efficient of the DCHP. gas chp,max ij,t represents its gas transmission maximum capability. 4) DPSD and DHSD models: We denote p be ij,t and SOC be ij,t as the exchanged power and the stored energy of jth DPSD of ith EB at time t, respectively.

Remark 2: The coupling relationships among power, heat and gas of EI are embodied in three aspects: 1) For some energy conversion devices, the natural gas is the clean fuel for power and heat generation; 2) For DCHPs, the power and heat are cooperatively generated; meanwhile, they also should run in the corresponding feasible operating region; 3) Power, heat and gas demands can be transformed into each other in some situations.</p><p>For convenience, let p ij,t (h ij,t ) represent the power (heat) generation of DRG (DRHD), DFG (DFHD), DPSD (DHSD), DCHP or controllable power (heat) load demand of ith EB, and let g ij,t represent the gas supply of DGP or controllable gas load demand of ith EB. The number of decision variables of different participant may be different, e.g., DFG, DCHP and EL have one, two and three decision variables, respectively. Without loss of generality, we let</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">e ij,t = [p ij,t , h ij,t , g ij,t ]</formula><p>T be a three-dimensional decision variable.

Thus, on the basis of the hourly EMP of EI, an adjustment strategy for power-only devices and controllable power loads is further developed for adapting to the shorter power scheduling problem, i.e., 5-min considered in this paper. Then, the 5-min power loads variations and fluctuations of DRGs can be accommodated by dispatching the power generations of DFGs, DPSDs and controllable power loads. In this paper, the goal is to make the 5-min power scheduled result of each power participant follows its corresponding hourly scheduled result as close as possible.

Firstly, the work of each node is based only on the local sharing of information among neighbors to find the optimal operating point, resulting in alleviated single-node congestion. Moreover, the EI can work well even under single and even several communication link failure(s), as long as the communication network maintains connection. Thus, the EI becomes more robust against single-point failure by implementing the proposed algorithm. Secondly, a node can join in the EI by establishing communication links with its local neighbors only. Consequently, it is more flexible for possible integration and expansions of different energy resources. Thirdly, regardless of the scale of the EI, each node only performs a local optimization. It also means that the communication and computation burden can be divided among the distributed processors, thus being able to encourage better scalability.

Meanwhile, the final power, heat and gas outputs/demands of each participant, shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, are within their operational ranges, which implies all the   set of inequality constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the optimization goal is fulfilled. According to the results above, we can also get that the cooperative power, heat and gas market clearing prices are 32.6887(p.u.), 23.6611(p.u.) and 15.2825(p.u.), respectively. In addition, the final profit of each EB is also summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. Each EB may play different roles based on its and neighbors' state. Let us use EB4 as an illustration. Note that âp 4,t0 &gt; 0 and âg 4,t0 &gt; 0, so it serves as a power and gas supplier, and these parts of excess self-generated power and heat will be sold to its neighbors. Meanwhile, âh 4,t0 &lt; 0, so it also serves as a heat consumer and will buy deficit heat from its neighbors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Plug and Play Test</head><p>In this case study, the focus is on testing the plug and play performance of the proposed algorithm. All the initial conditions are the same as in case 1. On the basis, at t 1 , the DFG of EB1, DCHP of EB2 and EL of EB5 are removed from the system at the same time, and the variables related to them are set to zero. From Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>  the total power, heat and gas mismatches converge to zero; meanwhile, the estimated power, heat and gas dual variables converge to their corresponding optimal values. Of course, the remaining participates have to adjust their power, heat and gas outputs/demands to compensate for the amount of power, heat and gas previously supplied or consumed by the disconnected DFG, DCHP and EL, and finally converge to a new solution. Further, at t 2 , they are all plugged again back to the system. The simulation results are also shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. It can be seen that the system again converges to the new solutions responding to the new topological change. In addition, the final convergence solutions after t 2 are the same as the one prior to the disconnection. This implies that the proposed algorithm provides good plug and play capability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Scalability Analysis</head><p>This case study focuses on analyzing the computational scalability of the proposed distributed-consensus-ADMM algorithm with respect to the number of nodes (or participants). The number of nodes is set as [10, 30, 50, â¢ â¢ â¢ , 970] with total 50 groups. Meanwhile the percentage of DRG, DFG, DPSD, DRHD, DFHD, DHSD, DCHP, DGP, and EL are set as 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%,10%, 10%,10%, 10%, and 20% in each example. The parameters of each type of participant are randomly selected the corresponding ones as shown in Table <ref type="table">A1</ref>. The stopping criterion of the proposed algorithm is based on calculating the solution accuracy of the following equation where N is the number of nodes. The algorithm is set to stop once MSE below the preset accuracy denoted as acc.</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">M SE = 1 N n â i=1 mi â j=1 â¥ e ij,t (k) -e * ij â¥ 2 / â¥ e * ij â¥ 2<label>(39)</label></formula><p>Next, we will analyze the trend of the average number of iterations, expressing the average computational complexity, with the growth of the number of nodes under the same acc. For each group of nodes, it will be randomly tested with 100 times. By employing the same data fitting method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, the fitting curve and functions with acc = 10 -4 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>. Therein, R 2 â¤ 1 represents the coefficient of determination, and the higher value of R 2 is, the better fitting effect becomes. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, it can be observed that the average number of iterations for the proposed algorithm is approximately logarithmic (but not exponential) growth with the increase of the number of nodes. Thus, we can verify that the proposed algorithm can provide good scalability on the part of computations burden. In addition, for each participant, the number of communication times directly comes from the number of computation iterations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm also exhibits better scalable behavior in terms of communications burden.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. 5-Min Power Scheduling Adjustment</head><p>This case study focuses on analyzing the 5-min power dispatching problem on the basis of 1-h dispatching results in case 1. The 5-min power must-run loads variations and fluctuations of DRGs are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10(a)-(b)</ref>, while the corresponding dispatching results of DFGs, DPSDs and controllable loads during each scheduling horizon are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10(c)-(e)</ref>. It can be seen that we can not only adjust the power generations of DFGs and DPSDs but also the power demand of controllable loads to smooth out the renewable energy fluctuations and loads variations. Note that, for each DFG, DPSD or controllable power load, the 5-min dispatching results can track its hourly dispatching result in a better way, to further ensure the effectiveness of maximum social welfare in hourly scheduling. In addition, the participant, which holds larger capacity, is able to undertake task for accommodating the power variations and fluctuations. For example, the changes of the 5-min dispatching curve of participant N.15 with p l,max 15,t = 1000(p.u.) is larger than that of participant N.53 with p l,max 53,t = 750(p.u.) as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10(e</ref>). From the discussion mentioned above, the designed 5min power scheduling adjustment strategy can not only meet the requirement of hourly scheduling goal but also smooth out 5-min loads variations and fluctuations of DRGs. </p></div>

Along with the EB, the system model has be established, which can better reflect the features and requirements of EI in a more precise way. Furthermore, the EMP of EI has been finally formulated as a distributed non-linear coupling optimization problem, which can be effectively solved by the proposed distributedconsensus-ADMM algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm is a fully distributed algorithm, where each participant requires only the information from its neighbors to estimate the optimal energy market clearing price and calculate the optimal energy outputs/demands. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated by several simulation results. </p><formula xml:id="formula_67">Îº ij (K) = n â i mi â j Îº ij (0)/ n â i m i = n â i (m i q i,t /m i ) / n â i m i =Îº * , (<label>40</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_68">)</formula><p>which implies that if we construct a variable Îº ij for each participant, then, starting from Îº ij (0) =q i,t /m i , Îº ij (k) can converge to Îº * by implementing <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Proof of Theorem 2</head><p>In Theorem 1, it has been verified that Î» ij can converge a common value, i.e., Î» * . The rest is to verify that e ij,t (k + 1) can converge to its corresponding optimal point.

(50) Note that (49) and (50) are the optimality conditions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Thus, we can conclude that e ij,t (k + 1) â e * ij,t as k â â.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Proof of (38)</head><p>In the interest of clarity, we analyze the case where the local inequality constraints are not taken into account. For a given energy selling (or bidding) price denoted by Er ij,t .

To obtain maximum profit, each participant tends to adjust its energy outputs (or energy demands) until the marginal cost (or utility) is equal to Er ij,t . Stimulated by energy supplierdemand mismatches, each participant will adjust its selling (or bidding) to meet the supplier-demand balance. For example, a supplier is willing to increase its selling price and produce more energy for deficit market energy demand. We consider that the market is comparatively competitive. Thus, the market is cleared when all the selling and bidding price are equal to the same value, i.e. Er ij,t = Er t for all participates. And Er t , i.e., so-called energy market clearing price, is determined by the conditions Compared ( <ref type="formula">52</ref>) with (54), it can be observed that Î» = -Er t . That indicates the calculation of Î» and Er t is equivalent. </p></div>
