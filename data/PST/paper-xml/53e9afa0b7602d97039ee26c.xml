<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kinematic Manipulability of General Constrained Rigid Multibody Systems</head><p>John Ting-Yung Wen, Senior Member, IEEE, and Lee S. Wilfinger Abstract-This paper extends the kinematic manipulability concept commonly used for serial manipulators to general constrained rigid multibody systems. Examples of such systems include multiple cooperating manipulators, multiple fingers holding a payload, multileg walking robots, and variable geometry trusses. Explicit formulas for velocity and force manipulability ellipsoids are derived and their duality explained. Singularities are classified into two types:</p><p>1) unmanipulable singularity;</p><p>2) unstable singularity. The former is similar the singularities in serial chains where velocity manipulability ellipsoid is degenerate and force manipulability ellipsoid infinite. The latter is unique to parallel mechanisms, the velocity manipulability ellipsoid becomes infinite and force manipulability degenerate. In the case of multifinger grasp, these concepts correspond to unmanipulable or unstable grasps.</p><p>Index Terms-Kinematic stability, manipulability, multiarms, multibody systems, multifingers, parallel robots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A MECHANISM is called parallel if it consists of internal closed kinematic loops. Such mechanism has long been recognized to offer superior rigidity and load to weight ratio than their serial counterparts. A platform type of parallel mechanism was first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and later in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This mechanism is now popularly known as Gough-Stewart platform (or simply <ref type="bibr">Stewart platform)</ref>. Most papers on parallel robots are based on this geometry. Extensive survey of parallel robots can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Most of this work is related to platform type of parallel robots, though there are later extension to truss type of robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Parallel mechanism has also been introduced in machine tool design with products offered by Ingersoll, Giddings and Lewis, and Hexel. These products all consist essentially of an inverted Gough-Stewart platform, called hexapod. Other parallel machining centers have also been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by applications to parallel robots, this paper considers the kinematic manipulability of general constrained multibody systems (including passive joints and multiple closed kinematic loops). We first present a general kinematic model which considers all degrees of freedom and then imposes the constraints as algebraic conditions. Kinematic models of multifinger grasping and a 6-DOF Gough-Stewart platform are used as illustrative examples. Through the principle of virtual work, we also derive the general static force balance model which can be considered as a dual of the differential kinematics. We then extend the familiar single arm manipulability ellipsoid concept first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Characterization for both velocity and force ellipsoids is presented. When applied to multiple cooperative arms employing a rigid grasp or to multiple finger grasping, this work is closely related to the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and is also closely related to the past work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We also extend the important concepts of grasp stability and manipulability. We obtain explicit characterization for both properties and present their physical interpretation. As illustrations, we include a planar Gough-Stewart platform, a full 6-DOF Gough-Stewart platform, and a planar two-finger grasping example from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>This paper is laid out in the following manner. We will first present the differential kinematic and static force model of a general constrained multiple-manipulator systems in Section II. The velocity and force ellipsoids, and extension of grasp stability and manipulability are presented in Section III. Section IV presents a number of examples.</p><p>Terminology and Notation: We shall use the term "spatial force" at a given frame to mean the vector of , and the term "spatial velocity" at a given frame to mean the vector . Given a matrix , we use to either denote the annihilator of ( ) or the transpose of the annihilator of ( ). The distinction of the two cases will be clear from the context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. DIFFERENTIAL KINEMATICS AND STATIC FORCE MODEL</head><p>This section considers the differential kinematics and static force balance of general rigid multibody systems. Multiplefinger grasping and a Gough-Stewart platform will be used as examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Differential Kinematics</head><p>We consider a general mechanism subject to kinematic constraints. The generalized coordinate (with the constraints removed) is denoted by . The active joints' angles are denoted by and passive ones by . We order the angles so that . Consider a general constraint (written in terms of the joint velocity vector) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> Let the spatial velocity of the task frame be <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> Suppose that is full rank. Then , where is the annihilator of . The task velocity can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(3)</formula><p>The mechanism is singular if loses rank; in other words, there are some directions in that cannot be attained (but which can be attained in other arm configurations).</p><p>1) Multifinger Grasp Example: As an example, consider the kinematic model of multiple fingers grasping a rigid payload shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. For each serial chain, the joint velocity vector is defined as , the arm tip spatial velocity is , and they are related by the arm Jacobian :</p><p>We consider a single task frame attached to the constraining rigid body (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) whose spatial velocity is defined as . On the payload side of the contact, the spatial velocity, , is related to the task velocity by where (4)</p><p>where is the vector from the th tip to the task frame. The relative velocity at each contact is parameterized by a velocity vector :</p><p>where the columns of are the directions where relative velocities at the contact are allowed.</p><p>To write the multiarm kinematics more compactly, we stack all the vectors (e.g., 's are stacked into a single vector ) and block diagonalize all the matrices (e.g., 's form the diagonal blocks of ), except for . Then the differential kinematic relationship can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Some examples of possible contacts are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defining</head><p>, we can represent the multifinger kinematic model in the general form as in (1) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>): (6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where is the annihilator for and is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of . Note that is of full column rank.</p><p>It is important to note that information may be removed from and prior to calculating . For example, if orientation is not important for the task to be performed, it may be useful to remove the orientation components of and , and calculate a simpler form for . However, the constraint Jacobian should contain full information about the system. It is also possible to include fingers having multiple (discrete) points of contact with the payload. The spatial velocities at these additional contact points can simply be added to the set of contact velocities, . We are currently working on the extension to continuous contact, e.g., when a finger wraps around an object.</p><p>2) Gough-Stewart Platform Example: For another example, consider a Gough-Stewart platform which consists of two triangular plates, with spherical joints at each of their three nodes as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Each bottom node is connected to two top nodes via a linear actuator, so there are six actuators in all. Suppose the task frame is attached rigidly to the top plate. Let the unit vector attached to each linear actuator be denoted by , where , the length of the connection be , the angular velocity of each leg be , and the angular velocity between the top plate and leg be . The rigid body transformation between the task frame and the top node connected to the th leg is denoted by [as given in ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)]. The kinematics then becomes Define a joint velocity vector with 42 components: </p><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) can be equivalently written as</p><p>In addition, the legs are constrained so they cannot spin about themselves, so which can also be written in terms of as where is</p><p>. Putting the constraints together, we have in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) as ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Force Balance</head><p>Static force balance can be considered as a dual to the kinematics. However, there is also the additional complication of static load such as gravity on each link and position feedback on the joint torque. We assume that these loads have already been excluded from the joint torque, or more specifically, we consider the joint torque to be the portion that balances with the load torque (the force that the arm exerts at frame ). In the serial arm case, the force balance is simply , where is the joint torque. This follows from the principle of virtual work: Since this holds true for any , the stated force relationship follows.</p><p>In the constrained mechanism case, we can apply the principle of virtual work in a similar fashion [using the differential kinematic relationship ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and noting that is now applied only at the active joints]:</p><p>Since this holds true for any , we have the force balance equation:</p><p>This can be equivalently stated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where is the "internal force" (in the multiple-arm context, the squeeze force).</p><p>The above can be viewed from another perspective. Instead of the constraint (1), we replace it with a "virtual velocity" (in the same spirit as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> in the multiple-arm rigid grasp context): <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> Applying the principle of virtual work again, we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> where is the force that enforces the constraint (1). Since the explicit constraint is removed, we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> This shows that the internal force in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is actually the force that enforces the constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>As an aside, it should be noted that in mechanism design, it is important to know the internal loading, , for a given amount of actuator torque, , and task loading, . This can be done unambiguously if</p><p>[where denotes the null space]. Equivalently, this means that the total number of unconstrained degrees of freedom (dimension of ) is at least as many as the number of independent constraints. Otherwise, one has an underdetermined problem for the constraint force. Such systems are called hyperstatic. This problem has been noted in the walking robot literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, several different approaches to resolve this issue have been compared.</p><p>We now apply the general frame work to the specific example of multifinger grasping. The force relationship is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> which states that the stacked contact force is zero in the direction where the contact is unconstrained (i.e., where relative motion is allowed) and the contact forces sum at the task frame to . Solving in terms of , we have: where is the force that enforces the constraint. Substituting into the equation and the contact constraint equation, we obtain ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>): <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> As a specific example, consider two fingers pressing against each other with a frictional point contact. In the absence of the load force, , we have the force balance</p><p>The last two sets of equations mean that is a pure force (no torque component). The first two equations mean that the force due to the first finger is exactly balanced with the force from the second finger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. VELOCITY AND FORCE MANIPULABILITY ELLIPSOIDS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Serial Manipulators</head><p>The velocity manipulability ellipsoid of a single, seriallylinked manipulator was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> as an indication of the relative capability of a robot arm to move in different directions. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Jacobian, , is the key tool in this analysis: <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where and are orthogonal matrices, and consists of a diagonal matrix with rows or columns of zeros added so that its dimension is the same as that of . The Jacobian maps a ball in the joint velocity space to an ellipsoid in the spatial task velocity space:</p><p>The principal axes of the ellipsoid are given by the columns of (left singular vectors), 's, and the lengths are given by the singular values, 's. The right singular vectors, 's, ( is the th row of ) are the preimage of 's:</p><p>. If is less than full rank, then one or more principal axes of the ellipsoid will have zero length, and the ellipsoid will have zero volume. We say that the ellipsoid is degenerate in this case. If the ellipsoid is degenerate for all configurations (for example, for an arm with less than 6 DOF), then we can restrict the spatial task velocity to a lower dimensional manifold so that the ellipsoid is not degenerate at least for some configurations. If the rank of the Jacobian drops below its maximum rank at certain configurations, the arm is said to be singular in those configurations. With the spatial task velocity suitably restricted, singular configurations would correspond to degenerate ellipsoids. In this paper, we shall always assume that the maximum row rank of over all possible configurations is full (i.e.,</p><p>); this necessarily means that is square or fat (redundant arm). Otherwise, the range of can be suitably restricted (for all configurations) so this assumption would satisfy.</p><p>As a dual to the velocity ellipsoid, the force ellipsoid has also been introduced in the literature as the image in the end effector force space corresponding to a ball in the joint torque space:</p><p>By applying the SVD to , we have . The nondegeneracy assumption means that where is square, diagonal, and full rank for at least some configurations. Partition with dimensions compatible with . Then</p><p>The bottom half of the above says that certain combination of joint torques cancel one another and does not produce an effector spatial force. They correspond to the self motion of a redundant arm. Solving the top half we obtain:</p><p>This means that the principal axes of the force ellipsoid are the same as the velocity ellipsoid, but the lengths are the reciprocal of those in the velocity ellipsoid. When the arm is in a singular configuration, the null space of would be nonzero (or one or more diagonal entries in are zero), implying that the force ellipsoid is infinite in the corresponding directions in . Such configurations restrict motion but are mechanically advantageous as the mechanism can (theoretically) bear infinite load in certain direction.</p><p>In this section, we present an extension of these concepts to general constrained mechanisms. For the specific cases of multifinger grasp, the development here is similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and the more recent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Velocity Ellipsoid</head><p>The unconstrained Jacobian, , maps a unit ball in the joint velocity space to an ellipsoid in the tip contact velocity space. Due to the constraint (1), only a certain slice of the ball (resp., ellipsoid) is feasible. It is reasonable to define the constrained ellipsoid as the set of spatial task velocities generated by a unit ball in the active joint velocity space: <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> The general kinematic equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) can be used to solve for . Partition and according to the dimension of and (active and passive joints): <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> Typically, is square, implying that the number of constraints is equal to the number passive joints. If is tall, the mechanism is over-constrained meaning some of the constraints may be removed (redundant constraints) and the constraint forces cannot be uniquely solved through rigid body formulation alone. This situation sometimes occurs in walking robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. If is fat the mechanism is under-constrained, meaning that the mechanism can always have internal motion even when all the active joints are locked.</p><p>Since the kinematic constraint always has at least one solution (otherwise the mechanism cannot move), we can write the complete solution of the passive joint velocity as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> where col spans the null space of , and is an arbitrary vector parameterizing the null space of . Substituting into (2), we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> Define the manipulability Jacobian as (24)</p><p>The constrained ellipsoid can be written as <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref> It is also straightforward to include weighted norms in the joint and/or task spaces in the above definition. Clearly, this definition makes physical sense only if</p><p>. Indeed, we consider the following classes of singularities:</p><p>1) Unmanipulable Singularity: This corresponds to configurations at which loses rank. This is the same as the singularity as in the serial manipulator case. The velocity manipulability ellipsoid becomes degenerate (one or more principal axis has zero length).</p><p>2) Unstable Singularity: This corresponds to configurations at which . This type of singularity is unique to parallel mechanism and there is no counterpart in serial manipulators. The velocity manipulability ellipsoid becomes infinite in along one or more principal axis. Physically, an unstable singularity means that there exists unactuated task motion, i.e., the task frame can move even when all the active joints are locked. An example of this case is the unstable grasp in multiplefinger grasping where the payload can rotate about certain axis even when all the finger joints are locked.</p><p>It is possible that but . This corresponds to the existence of internal motion involving only passive joints in the mechanism that does not cause task frame motion. An example of this case is when the support legs of a Gough-Stewart platform can spin about its own axis which does not cause any platform motion. Note that even when , may be ill-conditioned due to the term. For example, when the mechanism is near an unstable configuration, the velocity manipulability ellipsoid would be very large in certain directions.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the stable configuration condition is stated in terms of being of full column rank [or, equivalently, ]. This is completely equivalent to the analysis here since if and only if . This can be shown as follows. Let . Then which implies that . Suppose . Then and therefore (since ). By construction is of full column rank, hence, . In the reverse direction, suppose there exists . Then there exists such that . Now, Hence .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Force Ellipsoid</head><p>The force ellipsoid can be intuitively defined as the set of task forces that can be applied by the mechanism with active torques (or forces) constrained on the surface of a weighted ball. We first expand the constraint force balance equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> as Premultiply the second equation by , we obtain:</p><p>(26) for all . Clearly, if (unstable singularity), there exists some that the condition cannot be satisfied. This corresponds to the task frame spatial forces that cannot be resisted by active torque and internal constraint forces alone. Hence, the mechanism is unstable. Indeed, this is precisely the condition for unstable singularities.</p><p>If the mechanism is away from the unstable singularities, there are also several cases to consider. As in the discuss of velocity manipulability, the usual case is that is square (same numbers of constraints and passive joints). If is tall, then not all the internal forces can be solved (the system is hyperstatic). In this case, we call this unresolvable internal force which belongs to the null space of . If is fat, is always nonzero, meaning unless , the mechanism is at an unstable singularity.</p><p>Given the above discussion, we assume . Then can be solved from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">12</ref>) when the mechanism is not at an unstable singularity:</p><p>(27)</p><p>We may now define the force manipulability ellipsoid as the dual of the velocity manipulability ellipsoid:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(28)</formula><p>As in the single arm case, we assume that except at singular configurations (i.e., the velocity manipulability ellipsoid is not always degenerate). If this is not satisfied, we can always suitably restrict (and ) so that it is true. The force manipulability ellipsoid has the same principal axes as the velocity manipulability ellipsoid except that their corresponding lengths are reciprocal of one another.</p><p>When the mechanism is in an unmanipulable singularity ( becomes singular), the force ellipsoid becomes infinite in certain directions as in singular configurations for single arms. When the mechanism is in near an unstable singularity ( ), would become increasingly singular (since would be very large in certain direction). At the unstable singularity, in order for the force balance equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> [and hence (26)] to satisfy, must be in the null space of which means that the force manipulability ellipsoid is degenerate exactly when the velocity manipulability becomes infinite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Configuration Stability and Manipulability</head><p>For multifinger systems, there are two important concepts: grasp stability and grasp manipulability. A grasp is stable if any external force applied at the task frame can be resisted by suitably chosen joint torques. Equivalently, a grasp is also stable if there is no task motion independent from the joint motion. A classic example of an unstable grasp is two fingers holding a payload with frictional point contacts. The object can then spin about the line linking the contact points. Mathematically, the stable grasp condition can be stated as where and are as defined in Section II-A-1. A grasp is manipulable if any task velocity can be achieved with suitably chosen joint velocity. Mathematically, this condition can be stated as For general mechanisms considered here, unstable grasp corresponds exactly to unstable singularity and unmanipulable grasp corresponds to unmanipulable grasp.</p><p>It is interesting to observe the dual relationship between unstable configurations and unmanipulable singular configurations. At a unmanipulable configuration, the velocity ellipsoid is degenerate (mechanism cannot move in certain directions) and the force ellipsoid is infinite (mechanism can resist infinite force in the same directions). At an unstable configuration, the force ellipsoid is degenerate (mechanism cannot resist force in certain directions) and the velocity ellipsoid is infinite (mechanism can have any velocity using only passive joints). In a near unmanipulable configuration, large joint motion may be required to achieve small task motion. Similarly, in a near unstable configuration, large joint torques may be required to counteract small external force applied at the task frame.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Internal Force and Virtual Velocity</head><p>In ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), we introduced the concept of virtual velocity as the dual of the internal force. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we can also define a virtual velocity ellipsoid (resp. internal force ellipsoid) as the image of a unit ball of active joint velocity (resp. active joint torque) subject to the constraint that the spatial task velocity (resp. spatial task force) is zero:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(29) (30)</formula><p>Mathematically, these ellipsoids are exactly the same as the velocity and force ellipsoids discussed before except that the subscripts and are exchanged. Therefore, all the preceding discussion on their computation remains valid. The concept of unstable configuration now translates to a degenerate internal force ellipsoid and infinite virtual velocity ellipsoid.</p><p>In a general mechanism, internal force may determine if a constraint can be enforced. For example, in a multifinger grasp with frictional contacts, each contact force needs to be in the friction cone to ensure that the contact can be sustained. The internal force ellipsoid provides information on the ability that the active joints may impart on the internal force. Virtual velocity provides an appealing dual to the internal force, but it is not as practically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simple Two-Arm Example</head><p>We first consider a planar two-finger grasping example. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows two two-joint fingers holding a rigid object (here depicted as a bar) between them. First consider the Jacobian for each arm mapping the joint angles to the tip translational velocity:</p><p>where is the length of the th link of the th arm, is the sine of the th angle of the th arm, is the sine of the sum of the th and th angles of the th arm. The task velocity (defined as the translational velocity of a specific point on the held bar) is related to the tip velocity as: where , , and denotes the angle at the th contact. The overall kinematics is of the following form:</p><p>(31) Consider in particular the configuration shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. Such an example was first suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and discussed further in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The ellipsoid indicates that the system permits in both the and directions. This makes sense since the robots are allowed to pivot at the contact points.</p><p>To prevent pivoting at the contact, we simply remove in (31) and in (32). In this case, the ellipsoid is degenerate and the task frame can only translate in the direction. The degenerate ellipsoid (a horizontal line segment) is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, this example was used to demonstrate the superiority of the ellipsoid characterization as compared to those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. However, the key difference in terms of the nature of the grasp was not noted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Planar Gough-Stewart Platform Example</head><p>We use a planar Gough-Stewart platform to illustrate our approach applied to a mechanism that is not a single closed chain. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows various different planar Gough-Stewart platforms each with 3 active prismatic joints and 6 passive rotational joints.</p><p>We consider the task velocity as the linear velocity of the center of the platform.</p><p>(33) where diag , diag , (primastic joint velocities), , is the angular velocity of leg with respect to the ground, is the angular velocity of the platform with respect to leg , , . As in the previous example, the constraint kinematics include orientation and therefore needs to be separately stated:</p><p>(34) Using the results presented earlier, ellipsoids for different configurations can be readily generated (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). All of these cases correspond to stable, nonsingular configurations.</p><p>For the configuration shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, . For the case shown, the mechanism can have a pure horizontal motion involving only the passive joints (</p><p>). From a force perspective, the unstable configuration means that the mechanism cannot resist direction force applied at the task frame.</p><p>When the mechanism is near an unstable configuration, it may not be unstable mathematically, but the ellipsoid will be badly conditioned. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>, the motion in the direction is much larger than in the direction. When the mechanism moves in to the unstable configuration, the ellipsoid becomes infinite in the direction. From the force perspective, this suggests that a nearly unstable configuration is also highly undesirable as large forces from the active joints are needed to counteract disturbance force at the task frame. We have constructed a physical 3-DOF Gough-Stewart platform, and have indeed verified that unstable and nearly unstable configurations can have large internal motion with all the active joints locked. When the ellipsoid is well conditioned, such internal motion is no longer possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Six-DOF Gough-Stewart Platform Example</head><p>We now consider a 6-DOF Gough-Stewart platform. Let the three base nodes be at</p><p>The top platform is an isosceles triangle with the two equal sides of length 1.12 and the third side of length 1. The task velocity, , is defined as the translational velocity of the half way point of the line perpendicular to the base of the isosceles   The constraint equation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, is the same as in Section II-A, given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>The velocity ellipsoids of the Gough-Stewart platform in three different configurations are shown in Figs. 9-11 (the force ellipsoids have the same principal axes but reciprocal length). In the first case, the platform is horizontal. In the second case, the task frame is rotated 45 about the axis . In the third case, the task frame is rotated 22.5 about the vertical axis . In each case, three ellipses lying in the plane generated by two of the principal axes are shown. In the first case, the ellipse is well conditioned with the lengths of principal axes:</p><p>1.78, 1.43, 0.81 . In the second case, the ellipsoid becomes less well conditioned, the lengths of the principal axes are 2.31, 1.62, 0.29 . The motion parallel to the platform is more difficult than other directions. In the third case, the lengths of the principal axes are 5.62, 1.69, 1.49 . Even though the ellipsoid is fairly well conditioned (condition number of the singular values is 3.78), but external forces along the principal axis that corresponds to 5.62, , cannot be resisted as easily as in other directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper generalizes the velocity and force manipulability to general constrained multibody systems. Such systems include simple closed kinematic chain as two arms jointly holding a payload, multiple kinematic chains as in multifinger grasping, and more complex structures as multiple Gough-Stewart platforms. We classify singularities into two classes: unmanipulable singularities and unstable singularities. For the former, velocity ellipsoid is degenerate ad force ellipsoid infinite. For the latter, velocity ellipsoid is infinite and force ellipsoid degenerate. In general, unstable (or nearly unstable) configurations need to carefully considered in the kinematic analysis, otherwise there may be uncontrolled motion or large joint loading. Future work will include optimal kinematic synthesis based on the manipulability ellipsoids and consideration of systematic addition of kinematic constraints or actuation to modify the singularity structure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
