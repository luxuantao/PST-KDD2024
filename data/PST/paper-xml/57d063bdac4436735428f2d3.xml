<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present the design and evaluation of the Augmented Climbing Wall (ACW). The system combines computer vision and interactive projected graphics for motivating and instructing indoor wall climbing. We have installed the system in a commercial climbing center, where it has been successfully used by hundreds of climbers, including both children and adults. Our primary contribution is a novel movement-based game system that can inform the design of future games and augmented sports. We evaluate ACW based on three user studies (N=50, N=10, N=10) and further observations and interviews. We highlight three central themes of how digital augmentation can contribute to a sport: increasing diversity of movement and challenges, enabling user-created content in an otherwise risky environment, and enabling procedurally generated content. We further discuss how ACW represents an underexplored class of interactive systems, i.e., proximity interaction on wall-sized interactive surfaces, which presents novel human-computer interaction challenges.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Utilizing technology to increase excitement and motivation in physical exercise and sport has been increasingly researched in both HCI and sport science <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">43]</ref>. Computer-generated feedback has also been used to enhance movement skill acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37]</ref>. However, almost all the studies have been conducted in laboratory setting or as one-off experiments where researchers actively participate in the experiment. Studies in the real world can reveal new aspects of interactive technologies, as participants use the technology on their own terms and without supervision <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>. This paper contributes to the limited knowledge of designing technology and movement-based games <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> outside the laboratory, in real-world sport environments. We have set out to study how climbers interact with technology in a climbing center. This is motivated by the relatively few previous studies on indoor climbing, despite it being a rapidly growing sport <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref> and being considered for inclusion in the Olympics <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. We investigate the following questions that impact the design of interactive systems for sports:</p><p> What are the opportunities and challenges of augmenting a sport with interactive technology?  How does interactive technology change a sport? More specifically, in what ways can technology affect climbing or watching someone else climb?</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows our Augmented Climbing Wall system installed in a commercial climbing center. ACW combines projected graphics and depth camera body tracking to create interactive games and other training applications. ACW also includes a separate touch screen for more detailed and multiuser interaction, although we do also provide projected buttons on the wall for basic actions such as restarting a game level.</p><p>ACW is designed as a research instrument for probing the questions above, and also to solve the problem of providing several interesting climbing challenges and activities in a small space. Climbers constantly yearn for new routes to climb (problems to solve), and as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, fitting multiple routes in a small space easily introduces visual clutter and creates undesired challenges in finding correct holds. Projected graphics allow us to clearly highlight different routes and game levels that reuse the same set of holds. Climbers can quickly browse through the levels, avoiding the sometimes tedious search for routes suitable for one's skills. In this paper, we describe the ACW system and three interactive applications (2 games, 1 game level editor). We also present the results from installing ACW for daily use in a climbing gym for four months. Data was gathered in three user studies and by logging game events. We first review related work, then present the system and the design of the applications, and describe the three user studies (N=50, N=10, N=10). Based on the studies and our further observations, we highlight three central opportunities and challenges of augmenting a sport with interactive projected graphics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATED WORK</head><p>There has been a substantial amount of research on climbing, mostly concentrating on physiological and biomechanical aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">41]</ref>. The mental side of climbing has also been studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, especially the influence of danger and physical risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. There has been less research on using technology, with an exception provided by Climbax <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, which provides climbing statistics by utilizing sensors embedded in a wristband. Similar wrist worn inertial units can also be used for recognizing climbed routes in a climbing gym <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</p><p>In the intersection of climbing and HCI, interactive climbing walls have been developed before our work, but the prior systems have concentrated on attaching sensors and lights to climbing holds <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24]</ref>, or have not utilized full body tracking <ref type="bibr">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr">45,</ref><ref type="bibr">46]</ref>. Compared to this, our projector and camera setup has many benefits 1) full-body motion tracking for movement analysis and interaction, 2) real-time feedback and interaction with projected graphics, 3) projection on the entire wall instead of just the holds, 4) a configurable system for any climbing wall, and 5) recording the performance for instant replay or later analysis.</p><p>Climbing routes (a.k.a. problems) are often "solved" socially with others. Considering technology and sports on a more general level, there exists a growing body of work on enhancing motor learning and performance using computer-generated augmented feedback (AFB), such as sound effects or visuals that highlight salient aspects of one's performance.</p><p>When designed properly, AFB can both motivate and guide motor learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">42]</ref>. Computer generated feedback can be faster and more accurate than training with a video camera or receiving feedback from an instructor, which allows one to perform more repetitions and evaluations of a skill in a shorter time. Concurrent (i.e., real-time) visual feedback can especially benefit the initial learning of complex skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>. However, it should be kept in mind that the learner may develop a dependency on AFB, as explained by the guidance hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. Outside a strict motor skill acquisition focus, we are especially inspired by work such as Jensen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> and Mueller and Muirhead <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> that derives design knowledge through the study of athletes' experiences of incorporating experimental interactive systems to their practice.</p><p>Our key technological components are computer vision and interactive projections, which have a long history in HCI and movement-based games, with examples like the Ping Pong Plus augmented table tennis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, artificial reality martial arts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, Kinect trampoline games <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, as well as RoomAlive <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, where multiple computers, cameras and projectors can be calibrated together to transform an ordinary room into a game space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATION TO THE PRELIMINARY ACW STUDY</head><p>This paper continues an earlier preliminary study where we developed and evaluated six interactions with eight climbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. For completeness, we briefly review the interactions here:  We build on the preliminary study in three ways: 1) The preliminary study interactions were tested in a light-weight Wizard-of-Oz manner, but our system is technologically complete with computer vision, projector-sensorcalibration, and an additional touchscreen interface for switching and configuring the interactions. 2) We have chosen the three interactions of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and developed them further to a level where they work autonomously in a commercial climbing gym. 3) We evaluate the interactions based on three user studies, providing novel data for understanding augmented sports.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERACTION DESIGN</head><p>This section describes the design of our three applications: the Spark game, Route creation, and the Whack-a-bat game.</p><p>The applications are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, figures 4-7, as well as the supplemental video.</p><p>The high-level interface for selecting and configuring the applications is implemented on the touchscreen shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In general, our approach is to minimize interface elements such as buttons projected on the climbing wall itself. In principle, everything could be implemented with a projected interface, but using the separate touchscreen yields far more precision, e.g., when editing a route or browsing a large number of user-created routes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Spark Game</head><p>Evading the chainsaw was the interaction that elicited most excitement in the preliminary work, although some climbers did remark that it is quite far removed from regular climbing. The main change we have made is updating the game theme to avoiding moving electricity lines instead of chainsaws. This allows us to create obstacles of arbitrary shape, and makes visuals less ambiguous; with the chainsaw users were not sure whether they could touch the handle. The resulting Spark game is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. The game starts when the user taps the play button, after which the goal is to get to the stop button without touching or overlapping the electric lines. The lines may be static or moving, and some levels also have intermediate waypoints that open up new passages or otherwise change the level.</p><p>Although the spark game introduces new aspects to climbing, our goal was to preserve the following familiar and motivating aspects of climbing:</p><p> Each game level has a clear start and end.</p><p> The moves can be planned beforehand and executed while climbing, thus creating both cognitive and motor challenges.  Each level is predesigned (as opposed to, e.g., randomly created) so that it can be practiced and one can learn from the performances of others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Route creation and climbing</head><p>Our second application combines and further develops the projected routes and route building interactions of the preliminary study. Our touchscreen interface is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. The screen shows the Kinect RGB view of the climbing wall. Touches are mapped to projected graphics coordinates by using the Kinect 3D coordinate information of each pixel and projector-sensor calibration data. Touching a hold adds or removes a hold mark and an arc between holds. The created routes can be browsed by grade, ratings, times climbed or tried and time of creation. Climbers can also vote for a route grade, input a 1-5 star rating, and add comments.</p><p>We first attempted to allow climbers to design routes by climbing, but could not find a 100% reliable way of detecting which holds were used and should be included in a route. In some routes, the climber's whole body may hug the wall closely and cause erroneous selection of holds. It appears that there should be at least some way to edit and refine the route information, which is why we designed and implemented the touchscreen editor. Perfecting the automatic route detection is left as future work. In the end, it turns out to be a fun social activity to edit a route together with a friend, one person using the touchscreen and the other trying out the moves on the wall. This is in line with the positive comments about the sociality of the hand marks interaction of the preliminary study.</p><p>The Whack-a-Bat game</p><p>Our third application is the Whack-a-bat game (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>), where one attempts to touch a bat sitting on the holds before a timer runs out. When a bat is touched, it flies to a random location on the wall and restarts its timer. The new locations are randomized so that they never overlap the climber's body. As the game progresses, more bats appear, escalating the challenge.</p><p>Whack-a-bat extends the idea of the endless route automator of the preliminary study. We chose Whack-a-bat as our third application due to user and climbing gym staff requests about an endless endurance training application.</p><p>We also wanted to add a simple way of competing with others and monitoring one's own progress in a longer term.</p><p>In the first iteration of Whack-a-Bat, the bat simply appeared at each new location, and the users often had difficulty locating it. In the present version, the bat's flight between the holds is animated with ease-in and leaves clear trails. This is inspired by Chang and Ungar <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> who propose using cartoon animation techniques for making it easier for users to track objects and understand what is changing. However, the animation alone is not enough to make it easy to track multiple bats, as the climber is close to the wall and cannot view all of it at a glance. To fix this, the bats also broadcast their locations using visual beacons, i.e., expanding circles that allow one to infer the directions even when looking elsewhere. Previously, Khan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> have suggested dimming the brightness of other elements to point out the location of a specific object on a large screen, but this is not necessarily compatible with a game's visual design, and only works if one can see the whole screen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLIMBING WALL SETUP AND TECHNOLOGY</head><p>The ACW hardware setup comprises a climbing wall, Windows PC, Kinect V2 depth and color sensor, a projector, and the additional touchscreen. Presently, we have two setups, one at our university, and one at a climbing center. The wall dimensions are approximately 4 x 2.7 and 4.5 x 3.6 meters. While this is not enough for rope climbing walls, such wall height is common in indoor bouldering, which is a rapidly growing segment of climbing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>. Bouldering denotes climbing without a belay rope on low rocks or walls, with mattresses for safe falling. We use a 50cm thick mattress covered with carpeted polyethylene foam mat, which can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We have further ensured safety by using a slightly overhanging wall. This way, climbers are less likely to scrape themselves against the holds when falling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wall size limitations</head><p>The climbing wall size is limited by the Kinect's field of view (FoV) and depth measurement noise that increases with distance. A large wall requires placing the sensor far, which makes it difficult to discern details such as fingers from noise. Our sensor is placed at approximately 3.5 meters from the wall. A system designed for adults might work with a sensor further away, but the small hands of  children become a problem. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows examples of the depth sensing resolution and noise at various distances. At first, we also tried to implement the system using the older Kinect 1 sensor, which turned out too noisy. In a Kinect 1 depth image at 3.5 meters, one cannot even discern climbing holds from the noise. We have also investigated other depth sensing technologies, but the Kinect V2 appears to provide an unmatched combination of low price, high angular resolution (512x424 pixels with FoV of 70.6x60 degrees, i.e., roughly 7x7 pixels per degree), enough range, and high enough frame rate (30fps) for tracking dynamic movements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer vision</head><p>We use custom computer vision software, as the Kinect V2 default skeletal tracking and user detection was found unreliable when not facing the camera and hanging on the wall. This is to be expected as the tracker is heavily based on machine learning training data captured from people's living rooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, and the data is unlikely to include the body poses typical to climbing.</p><p>When the system is started, we obtain a one second average of the depth map of the static background. At subsequent frames, we perform basic background subtraction, i.e., we segment the pixels to foreground or background by comparing the depth values to the background average. This is straightforward except that one must carefully filter the pixels near foreground object edges, where the depth readings randomly vary between the foreground and background distances. The foreground pixels within 2-8 cm of the wall are labeled as touch points and used for detecting the pressing of projected buttons (e.g., the play and stop buttons of the Spark game). The touch depth range is constrained by both depth noise and occlusions. The upper limit of the range must be quite high to accurately detect touches when the actual point of contact with the surface is occluded by the user's hand or foot.</p><p>All foreground points are used for detecting intersections with the electricity lines of the Spark game. Here, the 2D lines are actually considered to signify 3D planes that protrude from the wall, perpendicular to it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration</head><p>Calibrating the system consists of three phases: 1) aligning the projector and sensor so that the wall fits inside their frustums, 2) software keystoning, i.e., the user drags the four corners of a projection rectangle to define the active interaction area on the wall, 3) the software projects a dot pattern and detects the dots by comparing the Kinect's RGB view to a reference image stored before the procedure, and 4) the dots are used to compute the transformation matrices between the game graphics coordinates and the 3D coordinates provided by the sensor. At the climbing center, we ran steps 1 and 2 once, and the software runs steps 3 and 4 every morning when the computer is turned on. We have found this adequate, provided that the Kinect is mounted firmly.</p><p>The game graphics are positioned within a 2D rectangle that is mapped to the projection rectangle. The applications all use 2D graphics which are faster to design and work without low-latency player viewpoint tracking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USER STUDIES</head><p>Our ACW system was first developed at our laboratory and then installed at the Boulderkeskus Isatis climbing center in Helsinki, Finland, May 2015. At the time of submitting this paper, the system had been running for 4 months except for a 4 week break when waiting for a replacement projector.</p><p>During the time, we conducted one primary user study (N=50) and two supplemental studies (N=10). The primary study 1 investigates the Spark game using questionnaire data, study 2 continues with questionnaire data from all three applications, and study 3 compares two Whack-a-bat interface versions. We also logged game usage data, which we summarize at the end of this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Spark game questionnaire</head><p>In the beginning of our testing period, we only had the Spark game functional, and the other interactions were    We find it particularly intriguing that three respondents claimed the game made them forget their fear of heights, "Really great grip practice! I forgot to fear heights and falling", "Excitement provided by the game at one meter above the ground". We have also observed similar effects in our previous work on trampoline games <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The spectator experience: new forms of interaction the climber</head><p>Answers to Q4 highlight how the new perceptual challenges of observing all directions and dynamically changing levels also change the spectator's role, "More exciting, one could participate as a spectator by giving instructions related to the moving lines.", "More interesting and nice to give guidance and warn the climber about the electricity.", "One more often shouts 'HELP!','LOOK OUT!', 'AAAAA' compared to just shouting beta". Beta is climbing slang for instructions. In general, spectating the game was also found more fun and exciting. Sound and visual effects also received positive responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technological and perceptual issues</head><p>Q1 responses reveal that during our test period, ACW was still a prototype and not a finished product. Especially tracking robustness and/or communicating the limits of the technology were found to require more work. Users criticized the game for "It was hard to perceive one's body on the wall -&gt; easily hit the electricity", "Electricity borders are imprecise, difficult to estimate whether one's head or limb will hit the electricity", and "Detecting hits based on shadows instead of real body outlines". In reality the system is indifferent to the visible shadows of the user, and the comment simply indicates that there was some unpredictable behavior.</p><p>There appears to be two main failure cases: 1) tracking glitches due to occlusion and fuzzy object outlines such as hair, which cause random depth readings, and 2) the matching of a 2D shape on the wall surface and one's 3D body being up to interpretation. The first could be fixed by using multiple sensors and developing a custom model-based skeletal tracker to help in ignoring foreground point cloud outliers. The second is a design issue. We first considered detecting the electricity collisions only where one's body touches the wall. This was later discarded in favor of the present game where the electricity lines actually represent 3D planes protruding from the wall. Our rationale was that avoiding the 3D planes presents more interesting spatial puzzles. We believe that this approach is still valid as people clearly learn to play the game after getting "burned" a few times and observing the detected body outline rendered on the wall (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>). The body outline could also be rendered during play to make it explicit what the game detects, which we have so far avoided to minimize visual clutter and hide tracking and rendering latency.</p><p>Target audience: everyone, especially children.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, the most common answer to Q5 is that ACW is suitable for everyone (22 mentions). The next most common answers were children, beginners and "other", which comprises characterizations such as "Everyone, especially people who like games", "Rich people's homes?", "Active climbers." It should be noted that we deliberately equipped the wall with rather small holds that are more geared at intermediate and advanced than beginner climbers. The inclination of the wall (together with the smaller holds) also makes the wall really hard for beginners. On the other hand, the holds are easier for the small hands of children. During our visits to the climbing gym, we have observed children using ACW for several hours straight, which reflects the fact that adult routes are often too difficult for children and the gym only had little space for dedicated children's routes. It appears that ACW provides a space-effective way of expanding a gym's target audience to children.</p><p>A few Q3 responses highlighted negative aspects of how the Spark game changes climbing. "In normal climbing, the routes are defined and one works on them if one fails. The game does not force one to work on the route and develop one's technique." In light of this, the game might be more suitable for endurance and strength training or as a warmup exercise rather than developing perfect climbing technique. Three answers to Q6 also praised the game for providing great warm-up. We conclude that designers should be cautious about how digital augmentation can both expand and limit a sport's target audience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Deploying Whack-a-bat and route creation</head><p>We installed the route creation and Whack-a-bat applications 4 weeks before the end of the study. We also made available an updated the Spark game questionnaire with a field that indicates the application(s) that one has tried. According to the 10 filled questionnaires we have received so far, the applications work as intended. Two respondents mention that Whack-a-bat is the best application, and three remark that it is a great form of warm-up. The data is generally in line with the Spark game</p><p>Real Reality Interfaces #chi4good, CHI 2016, San Jose, CA, USA answers. According to our observations from visiting the gym, children in particular seem to like creating new routes, both for themselves and their parents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3: Improving spatial perception in Whack-a-Bat</head><p>Whack-a-bat attempts to improve the player's spatial perception using the circular beacons of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>. Since such beacons are not commonly used and could also introduce undesired visual complexity, we conducted a within-subjects experiment to validate their effectiveness. 10 users were recruited from university students and staff. Each user played the game with and without the beacons in counterbalanced order. The bat transition animations were turned off for both game versions. After experiencing each condition, the users were asked to rate the difficulty of knowing at all times where the bat is on a 7-point Likertstyle scale of 1=very easy, 4=not easy or difficult, 7=very difficult. The version with beacons was rated easy (mean=2.7, sd=1.4), and the version without beacons was rated difficult (mean=4.7,sd=1.4). A Wilcoxon signed rank test indicates that the difference is statistically significant (p=0.0039). After the test, the participants were also asked how the game versions differed, and how long it took them to realize what the beacons were for. 9 participants had noticed the beacons. All of them stated that they started using the beacon information after 1, 2 or 3 bats, which indicates that the beacons are fairly intuitive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Game logs</head><p>An overview of game usage data is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>. The overall usage time of the system has remained relatively constant after the introduction of the system. The large gap around day 50 is due to projector malfunction and waiting for a replacement projector.</p><p>Towards the end, it appears that less new routes have been created and people have been spending more time climbing the already existing routes. We do not have enough data for reliable statistical analysis, but the shift in behavior makes sense as there are now enough routes for most climbers to find something interesting. A total of 53 routes have been created so far.</p><p>Further analysis of the data is hindered, because the number of daily climbers greatly varied due to it being summer and most people climbing outside if it was good weather. The duration for which ACW was turned on also varied from 0 to 11 hours each day. The climbing gym staff sometimes forgot to turn the system on at all, which is a result in itself -a system like ACW should not require even a single daily maintenance task for reliable data gathering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>To inform the design of future augmented sports, we now articulate the central opportunities and challenges that emerge from our data and experiences.</p></div>

Similarly, movement professionals often enjoy a playful exploration of the capabilities of the human body.</p><p>As dancer and choreographer Steve Paxton puts it, "I have a hunger to find, and to finish, and to explore, to do essentially what babies do when they begin to move. A hunger to find out more of what movement is or can be." <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This is also in line with studies that have found curiosity as one of the central intrinsic game motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28]</ref>.</p><p>Climbing provides highly different movement challenges compared to movement-based games played on a floor, and the Spark game can be considered to further increase diversity in the following ways:</p><p> The targets to reach can be anywhere, whereas in regular climbing the goal is to reach the top of the wall, from where one jumps down on a mattress or is lowered down on a rope. Climbing downwards requires different movements and skills and is often regarded as boring, but a game can make it meaningful and fun.  In addition to targets to reach, there are also obstacles to avoid, which poses new challenges for spatial perception and movement planning.  The obstacles and targets can move, which presents new timing challenges, e.g., jumping up or dropping down at the correct time.  The game requires quick decision making and forces one out of one's comfort zone.</p><p>The increased diversity also appears to make climbing more accessible, allowing one to perform more attempts and succeed at least partially on a wider range of difficulty levels. For example, the level in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> is so hard due to the precise timing and coordination needed that even highly experienced climbers have had to try more than 10 times. Typically, routes of this difficulty are so physically demanding that one simply cannot perform multiple attempts in a short time. Routes above one's own climbing grade also often have so difficult holds that one cannot perform even a single move. As the Spark game is not so focused on grip strength, it is easier to make at least some progress on even the most difficult levels. Note that the importance of grip strength could be easily adjusted by using different holds. The reduced fear of falling and safer practicing of dynos also imply increased accessibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opportunity 2: Enabling user-generated content in sport</head><p>The conceptual contribution of the route creation application is that it adds the ability for users to create and share content (routes, game levels) in a sport where one is not typically allowed to modify the environment because of safety reasons. Usually, only the climbing center staff or professional route setters adjust the holds, since an improperly secured hold can cause physical injury, and adding new holds without careful planning may block existing routes.</p><p>We believe our safe-to-edit digital content layer could be extended to other sports as well. This can be motivated by the game industry success stories of publishing a level editor together with a game, which can help build a longlasting following and community around a game, with examples like Little Big Planet, Cities Skylines, and Trials Evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">48]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opportunity 3: Enabling procedural content in sport</head><p>Whack-a-bat can be considered as a simple example of procedural generation of the augmented digital content layer. Related to this, procedural game level synthesis is an active field of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. In the context of climbing, some progress has been previously made in synthesizing textual route "recipes" such as "R slopey ledge, L match, R medium crimp sidepull…" <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. In our experience, procedural content in sport is particularly suitable for motivating endurance training, where one can easily run out of handcrafted content.</p><p>We find both user-generated and procedural content especially important because they reduce the need for manually adapting content for the physical environment. Presently, we only have two flat walls of nearly equal size, but we have already experienced difficulties in playing the same game levels or climbing the same routes on both walls. Game feel depends on the hold sizes, shapes, and orientations. Further, scaling the visuals has a strong effect on the difficulty of maneuvering between Spark game electricity lines. Adapting content for different 3D wall shapes is even more challenging. Similar problems are likely to be encountered when augmenting other sports with varying physical environments, e.g., skateboarding or parkour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenge 1: Understanding Proximity Interaction on Large Interactive Surfaces</head><p>The Spark game data indicates that people sometimes have difficulties of being aware of the extents of their body in space and in relation to the projected graphics. The iterative prototyping and testing of Whack-a-bat have further confirmed that ACW presents an uncommon combination of human-computer interaction challenges:</p><p> Although people around see the whole screen, the person interacting on the wall (at an arm's length) only sees a portion of it at a glance. One's own body also often occludes a portion of the view.  Due to gravity, the user must stay close to the surface at all times and cannot step back to view the whole.  Staying on the wall requires heavy exertion and paying attention to holds, which limits the attentional capacity available for other tasks.</p><p>We believe that somewhat similar challenges may be encountered in other sports as well, e.g., when designing interactive visuals for a dance floor. More research is needed on interaction techniques that work in such settings. Vision is of course not the only sense that can be utilized, as suggested by Black and Loviscach's research on positional audio for large displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenge 2: Preventing Cheating</head><p>The Spark game leaderboards feature several implausible high scores (very low times between pressing the play and stop buttons), which are due to cheating. The most common cheating method we observed was to use two players, one for each button.</p><p>The lesson learned is that digital augmentation can introduce cheating even in a sport otherwise strong in selfregulation. Climbers usually avoid cheating despite the ample possibilities. In indoor climbing, the routes are typically color coded, a single wall has holds of multiple colors, and it is up to the climbers to stay honest and only use the correct holds. On the other hand the cheating is not surprising in light of previous gamification studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10]</ref>). The Spark game leaderboards add extrinsic goals and motivation to climbing, and it has been found that an extrinsic goal orientation (a desire to engage in learning tasks because of extrinsic goals) is associated with cheating <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>. It remains as future work to prevent cheating, e.g., by upgrading the computer vision to detect how many persons are on the wall, and focusing on supporting intrinsic instead of extrinsic motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenge 3: Robustness and adaptivity to real-life conditions</head><p>In our experience, off-the-shelf electronics are vulnerable to the fine magnesium carbonate dust that floats in the air due to climbers applying the substance to their hands. The dust is not necessarily visible but still accumulates on everything, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>. Our first projector drastically degraded in brightness during the first few weeks. In service, it was revealed that the dust had infiltrated the light source container. The lesson learned is that for prolonged use, one cannot avoid investing in hermetically sealed or otherwise dust-proof hardware.</p><p>Magnesium carbonate is also used in other sports such as gymnastics. Another problem is presented by vibrations caused by people jumping off the walls. Such vibrations are also encountered in other sports such as weight lifting and gymnastics. We mounted our projector on the ceiling, and the resulting long projection distance makes vibrations highly visible -the graphics shake with an amplitude of several centimeters whenever a climber jumps off a nearby wall. Depending on sensor rigging, the vibrations could also interfere with computer vision.</p><p>Considering environments beyond our two present setups, we need to expand ACW from small and planar walls to larger and richer 3D shapes. As described earlier, it is a challenge to automatically adapt routes and game levels to different walls, which is however desirable if one aims at a low-cost system that can be installed anywhere without building a new wall. It also remains a technical challenge to accurately track a climber on a large wall with as simple camera setup as possible. The Kinect V2 has a limited range, and affordable long-range depth sensors have limited angular resolution. One solution could be to infer depth and 3D shapes from multiple high-resolution RGB cameras, but it remains unclear how fine precision one can achieve, e.g., for detecting when a climber touches a hold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented Augmented Climbing Wall, a novel sport training and movement-based game system with three prototype applications. The system has been received well, and the Spark game level in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> was even used as one of the competition problems in the Finnish bouldering cup final competition of 2015. According to our interviews with climbing gym staff members, ACW also makes birthday party and school groups climb for a longer time, and people making bookings have specifically asked whether ACW is available.</p><p>Our work highlights three opportunities in digital augmentation of a sport. First, interactive augmented visuals can increase the diversity of movements and challenges, e.g., timing of moves in an otherwise strengthcentric sport. Second, a digital malleable content layer can empower users to become content creators with low risk compared to allowing users to actually modify the physical environment. Third, the digital content can also be procedurally generated, which is useful especially for endurance training sessions of non-predetermined duration.</p><p>Other noteworthy findings include increased spectatorathlete interaction and users forgetting their fear of heights.</p><p>We have also highlighted three challenges that provide pointers for future work: 1) facilitating perception and interaction when close to a large display, 2) avoiding and preventing cheating when adding extrinsic motivators such as leaderboards, and 3) improving robustness and adaptivity of technology in real-life sport environments.</p><p>Considering generalizability, a climbing gym represents a class of sport environments characterized by 1) challenges defined as routes between two or more points, and 2) the player being bound by gravity in a way that makes it possible to use projected graphics to define the routes and add obstacles. We believe that similar interactions and technology could work in other such environments, e.g., BMX and skate parks. Extending the approach to a larger climbing wall with an automatic belay system should also be possible, but poses more challenges as the computer vision needs to work at a longer distance and tolerate the moving belay ropes. The price of projection technology also grows rapidly with the projection area.</p><p>In our future work, we intend to continue exploring the possibilities of user-created and procedural content in sport.</p><p>It would be intriguing to interview climbers and route creators about their motivations to create routes, what makes a good route, and compare the results to research on game level design. Further, if one can derive a set of design guidelines for good routes or gather enough example data, it should be possible to create a computational creativity system for procedural route synthesis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
