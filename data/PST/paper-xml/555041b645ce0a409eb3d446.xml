<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The instances of open content, which is user-generated digital information produced in an open and collaborative manner, have dramatically increased over time on the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Open content is defined as -content possible for others to improve and redistribute and/or content that is produced without any consideration of immediate financial reward-often collectively within a virtual community‖ <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Today, Wikipedia, the largest online open content system, has become a means of knowledge acquisition and knowledge diffusion over the Internet. Over 500 million global users access Wikipedia and do not pay for accessing and using the content. Numerous people consider Wikipedia an authoritative source of knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Wikipedia is different from traditional encyclopedias, such as Encyclopedia Britannica, which are organized, written, and edited by established scholars. Instead, Internet users develop and maintain Wikipedia on a voluntary basis. Wikipedia users participate in writing encyclopedia articles in a spontaneous manner without expectations for monetary rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>.</p><p>Encouraging user participation is critical to the sustainability and success of the Wikipedia system. The Wikipedia website provides basic functions for users to write and edit articles. It also includes features of an online community, such as forums, bulletin board systems, and mailing lists, for users to communicate and interact with each other. Users write original articles, edit and improve existing articles, provide quality assurance, participate in policy setting, and engage in community building and maintenance activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Thus, there are different types of participative behaviors conducted by Wikipedia users. The first is writing and editing articles, which contributes to the creation and growth of encyclopedia contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The second is community activities, such as answering questions, discussing community issues, taking part in voting and community administration issues, and offering ideas for community development <ref type="bibr">[30,</ref> A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 69]. The second type of behavior is important because voluntary participants develop Wikipedia in a collaborative manner. It is necessary for these participants to be involved in the management and coordination of the development process.</p><p>Prior studies of Wikipedia examine how Wikipedia users' motivations affect their participation and contributions. For example, people may contribute to Wikipedia for both tangible and intangible benefits, such as career development, knowledge learning, personal enhancement, enjoyment, and self-achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. Some research also reveals the important role of altruism, which is a dominant driver for Wikipedians <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Social and relational factors, including a sense of belonging and reciprocity, also have significant impacts in Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>However, these prior studies do not differentiate between the two types of contribution behaviors mentioned above. They mostly focus on participants' contributions in terms of writing and editing articles. Previous research indicates that members in a virtual community of practice (VCoP) may contribute to the community in multiple ways, such as offering personal knowledge, helping the owner or manager build the community, and/or investing effort in maintaining the health of the community. Participants with different motivations are likely to contribute in different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A complicated knowledge base such as Wikipedia requires different Web 2.0 features and functions. Shang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> find that users of different Web 2.0 features exhibit different motivations for participation. Research on an organization's Wikipedia system also suggests that users contribute in different ways, and their contributing behaviors are driven by different motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>.</p><p>Users who contribute to Wikipedia consider adding or editing content a way to gain knowledge and develop skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. When a user contributes by adding or editing an article, the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 contribution is immediately visible in the form of digital content on Wikipedia. Constantly adding content to Wikipedia may help the user achieve prestige and recognition in the system because Wikipedia displays the ranking of top contributors for a certain period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Thus, the user may be confident that offering content on Wikipedia will result in some tangible form of being recognized. However, these contributors may not get any direct rewards through community participation, such as responding to posted questions, voting for community issues, or offering ideas for system development. In addition, individuals have more freedom in community activities than in content editing that is subject to standardized procedures and constraints by the Wikipedia system <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. We posit that the same motivational factors may exhibit differential effects on content contribution and community participation in Wikipedia. We believe that a systematic investigation into the respective effects of motivational factors is an important step towards a more complete understanding of user motivations and behaviors in Wikipedia.</p><p>We draw upon self-determination theory as the theoretical lens to analyze user motivations and their effects on content contribution and community participation behaviors.</p><p>Based on the basic tenet of innate human needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, self-determination theory explains human behavior by specifying different categories of motivations: external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, integrated regulation, and intrinsic motivation. Although the theory has been adopted to identify various motivational factors and examine their effects on knowledge contribution and participation in online environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>, no study has revealed the motivational factors and their differential effects on the two different types of contribution behaviors in Wikipedia. We aim to conduct a systematic investigation to address the following research question: How do motivational factors affect content contribution and community participation differentially in the context of Wikipedia? The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: First, we review self-determination theory and the literature of Wikipedia. Second, we develop a research model and research hypotheses, followed by the research method. We then present the results of our data analyses.</p><p>Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the findings and their theoretical and practical implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review and Theoretical Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Wikipedia Research</head><p>Online encyclopedias have experienced rapid growth in the last ten years. Today, Wikipedia, the largest online encyclopedia, contains millions of articles in over forty different languages and has become an important online knowledge repository for Internet users worldwide. In addition, other online encyclopedia systems are also available in different languages and countries. For example, Baidupedia, the largest Chinese online encyclopedia, has over one million articles and is accessed by tens of millions of Internet users in China.</p><p>Recently, some research has examined the organization and process of open content collaboration, most of which studies Wikipedia. Wikipedia demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of bazaar-style knowledge creation and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, in which human knowledge is recorded and organized through an open, collaborative process <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. In Wikipedia, high quality information is assured because there are established procedures for evaluating quality, detecting errors, and making corrections <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. The accuracy and reliability of Wikipedia A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t compares favorably with traditional encyclopedias <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Wikipedia currently plays an important role as an online knowledge repository and information source. It is popular not only for lighter topics such as entertainment, but also for more serious topics such as health and legal information. Scholars, librarians, and students are common users of Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Research reports that a majority of college students use Wikipedia for quickly checking facts and learning background information and that most students have a positive experience with Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, Wikipedia has an impact on social economy such as the financial market <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>.</p><p>Research also indicates limitations in Wikipedia. For example, Wikipedia editors rely much on sources that are easy to find and read, thus the contents are not inclusive enough <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In addition, Wikipedia has limitations in references and citations, thus may not be suitable for serious reference work <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p><p>Research has been conducted on the success and performance of the Wikipedia system. Social networks have a significant impact on participants' performance in Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>.</p><p>Group size, shared experience, heterogeneity or diversity among members, member activeness, and balance of roles played by members (e.g. administrative vs. content-oriented) are found to have significant impacts on performance that is measured as the number of high-quality articles in Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. In addition, the mixture of new and experienced participants increases the likelihood of system success <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Cultural differences also exist in the Wikipedia community and have influences on the quality of articles and performance of the Wikipedia system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, both formal and informal governance mechanisms, such as refined policies, norms, consensus building, and discussions among members, are important to the Wikipedia community <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>. Conflicts among members should be managed since they negatively affect the output of participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. The viability and success of the Wikipedia system highly depends on users' motivations for participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Previous research has identified various motivational factors for users to contribute to Wikipedia, which include extrinsic factors such as favorable reputation building, knowledge learning, and self-development <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, and intrinsic factors such as altruism, enjoyment, and the ideology of free knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. In addition, social factors, such as reciprocity, membership/sense of belonging in the Wikipedia community are also important motivators for participating in the Wikipedia system <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. Among these motivational factors, the effects of self-development, altruism, reciprocity, and sense of belonging, rather than enjoyment and ideology, have been empirically confirmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. Some mixed findings about reputation or recognition have been reported in the prior empirical studies. Some research found that reputation building significantly influenced contribution activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, while others found no significant relationships between reputation and participation behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>.</p><p>We provide a summary of previous research on Wikipedia in Appendix A. The summary shows that Wikipedia users are driven by different motivations and contribute in different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. However, no studies have tried to demonstrate the conceptual differences between contributive and participative behaviors in Wikipedia. These two types of behaviors are not tested simultaneously in an empirical setting. It is unclear what motivational factors may apply to either content contribution, community participation, or both. No study has examined how motivations affect content contribution and community participation differentially.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Self-Determination Theory</head><p>Self-determination theory posits that innate human needs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) are the basic tenets that account for human psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. This A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t theory suggests that human behavior can be explained by various types of motivations that differ in the degree to which they are self-determined (i.e., the degree to which a motivation either originates from the self or is imposed externally). Specifically, Deci and Ryan <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> describe the structure of motivations as a continuum of self-determination. On one end is intrinsic motivation, which represents the highest level of self-determination. On the other end is amotivation, which means the loss of motivation that results from the beliefs that one's actions have no effect in bringing about desired outcomes.</p><p>In the middle of the continuum are four types of motivations that reflect various degrees of self-determination. As one moves along the continuum, motivations become more intrinsically oriented in that they involve an increasing level of self-determination and integration into one's system of values and beliefs. The first is extrinsic regulation, which leads to behaviors based on external rewards or constraints. The second type is introjected regulation, which means that an individual replaces external sources of control over his or her behavior with internal sources.</p><p>Although the individual internalizes the reasons for his or her actions, this internalization is not completely self-determined because there are still contingencies in place, albeit self-imposed ones. The third and fourth types of motivations involve high levels of self-determination.</p><p>Identified regulation means that a behavior is highly valued and judged as important to the individual and, thus, will be performed freely. Finally, the most autonomous type of motivation is integrated regulation, which means that one chooses to engage in behaviors that are congruent with other values and needs.</p><p>Categorizing motivations into these types provides more nuanced understandings of the nature of motivation and the working mechanism that underlies the motivation-behavior relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. As the theory suggests, different types of motivations lead to different A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 behavioral outcomes. Based on the continuum of self-determination, prior studies consider external regulation and introjected regulation to be controlled or extrinsically oriented motivations, while integrated regulation and intrinsic motivations are autonomous or intrinsically oriented motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Autonomous motivations and controlled motivations have differential effects on performance outcomes in terms of whether the task is simple or complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Autonomous motivations are associated with better performance in relatively complex tasks, while controlled motivations are linked to some advantages in relatively simple tasks. Prior studies also find that autonomous motivations promote volunteer and pro-social behaviors without monetary or external rewards. These behaviors include recycling, giving blood, or citizenship behaviors in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Activities that require discipline or determination are best promoted by intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Prior research also indicates that extrinsic and intrinsic motivations may have interactive effects and that extrinsic motivation will undermine the effect of intrinsic motivation in some contexts.</p><p>For example, reward or payment undermines people's altruistic motivation to help others <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>According to self-determination theory, different types of motivations lead to different behavioral outcomes through distinct regulatory processes. Prior studies have applied self-determination theory to identify various motivational factors and examine their effects on knowledge contribution or participation in online environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. Research has identified altruism and enjoyment as two major intrinsic motivations for online knowledge contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>. External motivations, including reward, reputation, learning, reciprocal benefits, and recognition from others, significantly motivate contribution and participation in virtual communities of practice (VCoP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>. Identified and integrated regulation motivations, such as value and personal beliefs, as well as community identification and In Wikipedia, contributing content is regarded as a way for gaining knowledge and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>It may help contributors achieve status and recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, contributions through community participation may not be rewarded directly in the system. If users want to edit articles, they have to follow standardized procedures offered by the Wikipedia system. All changes in the content are recorded in article histories and change logs. Inappropriate changes are removed quickly, and repeating offenders can be blocked from further editing articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. However, individuals have more freedom in community activities. They are less subject to similar external constraints associated with content editing, and their decisions to participate in communities are more likely to be influenced by internal mechanisms, such as interests, values, and beliefs than by external contingencies. Thus, the two types of contributive behaviors in Wikipedia, content editing and community participation, are different in the degree of self-determination.</p><p>Community participation is more autonomous, while content editing is relatively controlled. We posit that the two types of behaviors are influenced differentially by extrinsic and intrinsic motivations as specified by self-determination theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research Model and Hypotheses</head><p>Based on self-determination theory, we develop a research model as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">1</ref>. The antecedent factors included in the model have been investigated mostly in prior studies of Wikipedia and other types of virtual communities. People are motivated to gain reputation and recognition through participating in Wikipedia. They also access and gain knowledge in order to develop themselves in the process <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The rule of reciprocity, giving back to Wikipedia after A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t attaining knowledge from the system, promotes users' contributions to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Ideology and sense of belonging have significant effects in Wikipedia and other open content communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. Altruism and enjoyment are also the most important intrinsic motivations in Wikipedia and social computing communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>.</p><p>We then group the motivational factors into two categories according to self-determination theory. Reputation, reciprocity, and self-development are controlled or extrinsically oriented factors, since they refer to external rewards, benefits, or pressure. Altruism, enjoyment, ideology and sense of belonging are either intrinsic motivation or integrated regulation, thus they are mostly autonomous or intrinsically oriented motivations. Extrinsically oriented motivations (reputation, reciprocity, and self-development) are hypothesized to be more strongly associated with content contribution than with community participation. Intrinsically oriented motivations (altruism, enjoyment, ideology, and the sense of belonging) are hypothesized to be more strongly associated with community participation.</p><p>[Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">1</ref> here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Extrinsically Oriented Motivations</head><p>Extrinsic incentives or rewards are important factors that motivate voluntary knowledge contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Building a good reputation is an important motivator for an individual to contribute knowledge to online communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>. Studies also demonstrate that gaining a favorable reputation is an important external contingency for voluntary knowledge contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In open content systems, building a good reputation is regarded as a major benefit of participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>.</p><p>Reciprocity means that a person provides help to another person, believing that s/he should A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 13 reciprocate the benefits s/he receives from the other person <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Reciprocity is an important motivation for knowledge sharing and contribution in organizations, since it sustains ongoing supports and exchanges among individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Reciprocity is related to a sense of mutual indebtedness and obligation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>. In the context of online communities, community members contribute content, since they have a sense of fairness to repay other contributors <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>. In Wikipedia, reciprocity is also a major motivator, since users may contribute to Wikipedia in return for the benefits they get from it <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Self-development is associated with knowledge sharing and contribution. Lou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> find that learning is a major motivation in online communities, because contributing knowledge can benefit self-learning in the process of applying existing knowledge or exploring unknown areas.</p><p>Nov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> indicate that individuals who participate in online photo-sharing communities expect to improve their skills and learn from others in the field. Self-development is one of the motivations for volunteers to share in open content systems, because they want to learn skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>The skills gained from participating in the systems may help individuals to develop and advance. These motivational factors sit at one end of the continuum of self-determination according to self-determination theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Reputation, reciprocity, and self-development are less autonomous but extrinsically oriented. Although these motivations are related to both content contribution and community participation, there are differences in the magnitudes of their effects according to self-determination theory.</p><p>Wikipedia contains a reputation system to reward users' content contribution. Users who contribute content to the system may get credits in the process of their contribution. Wikipedia also displays the rankings of top contributors on the website <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Reciprocity is more prominent where users are closely related <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, the online community in Wikipedia is very large.</p><p>A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 14 Because of the large community size, weak rather than strong interdependence among users may occur. Therefore, direct reciprocity in the online community is not likely to emerge as in the context of content editing. In addition, by writing or editing articles, users have more chances to learn and practice knowledge than by answering questions in the online community. Thus, it is reasonable to posit that users' content contributing behavior is more strongly associated with extrinsically oriented motivations.</p><p>H1a: Reputation has a stronger effect on content contribution than on community participation.</p><p>H1b: Reciprocity has a stronger effect on content contribution than on community participation. H1c: Self-development has a stronger effect on content contribution than on community participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Intrinsically Oriented Motivations</head><p>Altruism, enjoyment, ideology, and sense of belonging are mostly autonomous and intrinsically oriented motivations. Ozinga <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> defines altruism as -doing something for another at some cost to oneself.‖ Altruism exists when people derive intrinsic enjoyment from helping others without expecting anything in return <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Knowledge contributors may be motivated by altruism based on their desire to help others <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Prior research shows that knowledge contributors demonstrate altruistic behaviors because they gain intrinsic satisfaction in helping others <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. In open content systems, altruism is an important driver for participation, because participants believe it is right to contribute to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref> and because they have the desire to help others <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t</head><p>As an intrinsic psychological reward, enjoyment represents an intrinsic motivation for human behaviors. Igbaria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> find that enjoyment has significant impact on information systems usage due to the recreational usage of the system. Individuals who experience immediate pleasure or joy from an activity and perceive the activity as inherently enjoyable are likely to become more involved in the activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Koh and Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> find that enjoyment is an important factor to motivate participants and that it is critical to the success of an online community. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> also find that enjoyment sustains individuals' community involvement. Von Hippel and Krogh <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> state that open content participation is self-rewarded, because developers feel that participation is enjoyable in nature.</p><p>Ideology of free knowledge is also an important driver for Wikipedia participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>Many people contribute to online encyclopedias voluntarily and freely, because they believe that knowledge should be shared and transferred freely. Wikipedia is created by voluntary contributors and is accessed and read by numerous people as a free online knowledge source. Thus, it is a promising model of free knowledge sharing over the Internet. Participants in Wikipedia motivated by the ideology of free knowledge may consider the success of the system as their own success. They may be willing to conduct behaviors that promote the success of the system even without explicit self-benefit.</p><p>Sense of belonging to a community enables people to consider the community's' goals and values as their own goals and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Members in an online community can generate a sense of belonging due to the social relationship and exchange among the members in the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. A member's sense of belonging is important for knowledge creation and collaboration in online virtual environments, because users with a strong sense of belonging are likely to contribute freely for the goals of the system. As stated above, compared with content contributing, community participation is more autonomous, less directly linked to the reward in the reputation system, and less subject to external contingencies associated with content contribution. Research on self-determination theory indicates that autonomous activities are best promoted by intrinsically oriented motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that community participation is mostly promoted by an individual's interests, values, and beliefs. Community participation is more strongly related to intrinsically oriented motivations.</p><p>H2a: Altruism has a stronger effect on community participation than on content contribution.</p><p>H2b: Enjoyment has a stronger effect on community participation than on content contribution.</p><p>H2c: Ideology has a stronger effect on community participation than on content contribution.</p><p>H2d: Sense of belonging has a stronger effect on community participation than on content contribution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Collection</head><p>We used a Web survey to collect data. Survey method was adopted because the motivational factors investigated in this study are the respondents' perceptions and beliefs that can only be measured through self-report. Participative behaviors, i.e., content contribution and community participation, were also measured through respondents' subjective responses in the survey.</p><p>Data were collected from registered members on Chinese Wikipedia. Wikipedia is the largest online encyclopedia in the world, and it currently contains versions in over forty different languages, including English, French, German, Chinese, and Japanese. Chinese Wikipedia is a A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t major component in the entire Wikipedia system, which currently includes over 500,000 articles and more than 10,000 registered users. Among the users, 1,265 were frequent users of the online messaging tool provided by Wikipedia. Using the messaging tool, we sent online messages to all 1,265 users, inviting them to participate in the web survey. In order to get a higher response rate, a reminder message was sent one week later, requesting users to answer the survey if they had not done so. A total of 233 users responded, and all were usable for analysis. The response rate was 18.5%.</p><p>Non-response bias was estimated using the extrapolation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The extrapolation method is based on the assumption that subjects who respond less readily are more like non-respondents. There were two waves of responses in this study: one after the initial invitation message and one after the reminder message. Responses from the two different waves were compared. First, we compared the demographic information of late respondents against early respondents using the chi-square test. Results show no significant difference between the two groups in terms of gender (p &gt;0.1), age (p &gt;0.1), and education (p &gt;0.1). Additionally, under the assumption that late respondents resemble non-respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, we used the MANOVA test to compare study variables of the two groups. No significant differences were found in all the factors (p&gt;0.1) between early and late responses. Therefore, we concluded that nonresponse bias was not a serious concern in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Insert Table 1 here]</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, the respondents were mainly male, below the age of 40, and with a college degree. Most of the respondents have used the Internet for over five years. They were registered users in Wikipedia for more than one year. The sample appears to be overwhelmingly male. This is consistent with the gender distribution in the population of Wikipedia contributors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Measures</head><p>All research constructs were measured using multiple-item scales adapted from prior studies, with minor wording changes to tailor the scales to the target context. Items for content contribution were adapted from Cho et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that measured the frequency of adding new content and editing existing content in Wikipedia. Items for community participation were adapted from Wasko and Faraj <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, Koh and Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, and Ma and Agarwal <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The scale asked several questions about whether a user had answered questions in the Wikipedia community and if s/he had participated in community activities. Items for altruism were adapted from Wasko and Faraj <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> and Kankanhalli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Items for reputation were adapted from Cho et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Items for self-development were adapted from Nov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Items for sense of belonging were adapted from Cho et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Items for reciprocity were also adapted from Cho et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Items for enjoyment were adapted from Agarwal and Karahanna <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Items for ideology were adapted from Stewart and Gosain <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>  Before data collection, we pilot-tested the measures, working with a group of users who were not included in the final survey. Feedback regarding the protocol of the survey and clarity of the adapted measures was collected from these users. Minor changes were made to the format of the questionnaire and the wording of a few questions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Analyses and Results</head><p>We analyzed data in SmartPLS 2.0, following the procedure recommended by Anderson and Gerbing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>In order to validate the measurement model, we assessed construct reliability and two types of validity (convergent and discriminant) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Reliability, meaning the consistency of measurement, was examined by both item reliability and composite reliability. Item reliability indicates the amount of variance in an item due to the underlying construct rather than to an error and can be obtained by squaring the factor loading. As shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, item reliabilities in our measurement model were well above the recommended value of 0.50. Composite reliability for each construct exceeded the suggested cut-off value of 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Thus, the reliability of constructs was confirmed.</p><p>Items were then tested for convergent and discriminant validity. Convergent validity was assessed by factor loadings and average variance extracted (AVE). The threshold for a factor loading indicating satisfactory convergent validity is 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. AVE measures the amount of variance due to the construct in relation to the amount of variance due to measurement error. AVE greater than 0.50 indicates acceptable convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, item loadings were greater than 0.70, and all AVEs were above 0.50. Therefore, all measures demonstrated adequate convergent validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Insert Table 2 here]</head><p>To evaluate discriminant validity, the matrix in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that each indicator loaded much higher on the construct of interest than on any other factors. In addition, square roots of AVEs A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 20 were compared with the correlations among the latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> confirmed discriminant validity: the square root of the AVE for each construct was greater than the correlations involving the construct.</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3 here]</ref> [Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4 here]</ref> To evaluate whether common method bias existed, we first examined the correlation matrix (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). All correlations were lower than 0.8, a threshold for major concerns about common method variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Further, we conducted a Harmon one-factor test <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> on all constructs. The test showed that the highest covariance explained by one factor was 49.76%. The potential of common method bias was, therefore, not a major concern in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>We then tested research hypotheses in two steps. First, we tested path coefficients of motivational factors. The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Insert Table 5 here]</head><p>The motivational factors explained 49% of the variance in content contribution and 44% of the variance in community participation.

Self-development was significantly associated with content contribution (β=0.288, p&lt;0.05) but not with community participation. Altruism was not significantly correlated with content contribution but with community participation (β=0.353, p&lt;0.01).

The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. The results showed that reputation did not have a different effect, failing to support H1a.

Altruism had a stronger effect on community participation (Δβ=0.332, p&lt;0.01), supporting H2a. Enjoyment, however, had a stronger effect on content contribution than on community participation (Δβ=0.197, p&lt;0.01), failing to support H2b. The effect of ideology was not different, failing to support H2c. Sense of belonging had a stronger effect on community participation (Δβ=0.275, p&lt;0.01), supporting H2d. The results of the hypothesis tests are summarized in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussions</head><p>Wikipedia users' content contribution and community participation were affected by different motivations. As the results show, content contribution was motivated by reciprocity, self-development, and enjoyment, while community participation was affected by altruism and sense of belonging.</p><p>Regarding our hypotheses about the effects of extrinsically oriented motivation, it is surprising to see that H1a was not supported. Reputation had no impact on either content contribution or community participation. There was also no significant difference between the effect of reputation on content contribution and that on community participation. This finding is consistent with some previous research, which indicates that the incentive of reputation may not A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 22 sustain an individual's knowledge contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Based on self-determination theory, a pure extrinsic incentive, such as a reward, may enhance an individual's participation and performance but only in the short term <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. An individual's sustained contribution depends mostly on his/her autonomous motivations, such as interests, values, beliefs, and personal goals, especially for a complex task that requires effort and discipline <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</p><p>We also note that the non-significant finding for H1a may also be due to the demographics of the users surveyed in this study. Our survey respondents were mostly common users or editors in Wikipedia, not managers or administrators. Wikipedia managers may be motivated by the incentive of gaining reputation. In order to achieve and maintain status, they must be recognized by the community. However, for most common users, reputation may not be considered a motivation if they do not care about their ranking or status.</p><p>H1b and H1c were confirmed. The impacts of both reciprocity and self-development were significant on content contribution but not on community participation. Article editing often includes collaboration among users within the same interest group, thus reciprocity most likely exists to sustain users' contributions. Users may also practice their knowledge or learn new information or skills from the contribution process, which leads to self-development. For learning and testing knowledge, users may benefit more directly from article editing than from community participation. Thus, users with the expectation for learning new information or skills may spend more time on content writing or editing rather than community participation. Community participation was not driven by any of the three extrinsic factors, because participation in the community may not bring direct or immediate benefit to the users.</p><p>Regarding our hypotheses about intrinsically oriented motivations, H2a and H2d were supported, while H2b and H2c were not. Altruism and sense of belonging motivated users' A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 23 community participation but did not show significant impacts on content contribution. This confirmed our hypotheses that users may be involved in community activities, because they have a strong sense of belonging to the Wikipedia community, and because they believe that helping the community is the right thing to do.</p><p>Contrary to H2b, we found that enjoyment had a stronger, rather than weaker, impact on content contribution. Enjoyment was a strong motivator for content contribution, but it did not have any impact on community participation. The motivation literature offers some potential explanations. Research suggests that intrinsically motivated contributors are self-directed <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</p><p>Although community participation activities are considered to be more autonomous and free than content editing, in Wikipedia, users have more fun in the process of content contribution since article editing is often regarded as a knowledge creation process that is innovative and challenging. Thus, content editing is more enjoyable than community participation activities, such as voting for community issues and answering questions. In addition, content editing is governed and controlled by a process, compared with community participation. However, the process is not controlled to such an extent that users do not have any freedom to edit content according to their beliefs. The effect of intrinsic motivation may not disappear but may be salient in the process of editing the content. In this case, users with stronger enjoyment motivation may choose to spend more time in content editing than in community participation.</p><p>Contrary to H2c, ideology did not have any differing impact on content contribution and community participation. Instead, ideology had no significant impact on either one. It can be interpreted that although Wikipedia users hold the ideology of free knowledge, such an ideology may not influence the extent to which they participate in Wikipedia. Previous research on open source communities found that individuals, with the ideology of free software, acted as agents of A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 24 social change and participated broadly rather than focused on a specific project <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Similarly, Chinese Internet users surveyed in this study, with the ideology of free knowledge, may choose to participate in multiple online encyclopedias besides Wikipedia, such as Baidu and Hudong. Thus, ideology does not show significant influence on their participation in Wikipedia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Implications for Research</head><p>Previous research on Wikipedia indicates that people may be motivated by many factors, such as reputation, self-development, social needs, altruism, sense of belonging, reciprocity, and enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. Some of these factors have been tested in terms of their relationships with participation and contribution in the Wikipedia system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This study contributes to the literature in the following manners. First, we differentiate two types of participative behaviors in Wikipedia, i.e., content contribution and community participation. Although previous research indicated that users might conduct various types of behaviors in Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, we are one of the first to distinguish the two participative behaviors at the conceptual level. We have also tested the effects of different types of motivations on the two behaviors. A more detailed investigation of the spectrum of such participative behaviors provides us the opportunity to reveal different behavioral patterns in users' participation and engagement in the Wikipedia system.</p><p>Second, we examine an extended list of driving factors that are described in the continuum of motivations by self-determination theory. Self-determination theory provides us the confidence to align different factors in a single theoretical basis. We have suggested that the two different participative behaviors differ in their degree of self-determination. Content contributing is relatively controlled and mostly driven by extrinsically oriented motivations, while community participation is more autonomous and mostly driven by intrinsically oriented motivations. The A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 25 findings from the empirical study were consistent with self-determination theory. We, therefore, have demonstrated that self-determination is a powerful theoretical lens in understanding motivations in the context of online knowledge sharing. The research findings also revealed that the motivations of reputation and ideology were not significant in promoting Wikipedians' contributions. This is consistent with previous research regarding online knowledge contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. In addition, as indicated by the research findings, the intrinsic motivation of enjoyment has significant impact on the relatively controlled behavior of content editing rather than community participation. Future research can further investigate the impact of enjoyment. Finally, the current study also advances the understandings of motivations for virtual community participation. Previous research indicated that an individual's participation in online communities was motivated by the expectation of reputation building, the need for self-development, enjoyment in helping others, reciprocity to others' help, social relationships with others, commitment to community, and sense of community <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>. However, previous findings did not indicate when and how the motivations had such effects. This study, for the first time, reveals that motivational factors may correlate with different participative behaviors. This implies that virtual community behaviors may be further explored in this A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t direction to obtain a better understanding of participation and motivations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Implications for Practice</head><p>In Wikipedia, users contribute content by writing and editing articles. They are also expected to cooperate and take part in community activities. The findings of this study have practical implications for how to motivate users in Wikipedia. Managers should realize the law of reciprocity. In a system like Wikipedia, a critical mass of core members has been the foundation of the sources for the content <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Managers should pay more attention to the core members, know the core members' profiles and specific requests, and provide more care and attention in order to increase reciprocal motivations. In addition, reciprocity is prominent when people are closely related <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Currently, Wikipedia users work independently and separately in editing articles. It is suggested that teams be organized for A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 27 editing important articles. A team may be formed and organized by a manger or a core member, with some users working collaboratively on articles. Following the team format, users can cooperate closely, and reciprocity will be enhanced among the users.</p><p>In addition, managers and developers should understand the role of enjoyment in content contribution. Currently, the user interface for editing articles is tedious, and it is not easy to follow the procedure requested by the Wikipedia system clearly. Novice users often feel confused about the system's functions and procedures. Thus, it is necessary to improve user interface design and system design. Previous research also indicates that giving instruction and training will reduce novice users' perceptions of the complexity of the system and enhance their feeling of enjoyment with a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Therefore, we recommend managers include more instruction materials (e.g. video program) on how to use the Wikipedia system. Multimedia functions, through which users may read and edit audio and video content in articles, can be implemented. This would likewise increase a user's enjoyment in contributing to the system. Adding features for mobile users can further make the system more attractive. For example, some online encyclopedias include mobile functions, so users may access the platform from their mobile units.</p><p>Community participation is mainly motivated by altruism and sense of belonging. Thus, to encourage community involvement, it is important to promote the development of social relationships by facilitating communications and interactions among members. Managers may initiate more online interest groups for members. Users within a group can post questions and other members can share relevant information. Features, such as chat rooms and discussion forums organized around topics of interest would also generate new insights.</p><p>In addition, it is recommended that some advanced online communication technologies, for A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 28 example, instant messaging, be added to the Wikipedia system to make it easy for users to communicate and interact. Better interactions will strengthen users' sense of belonging.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is suggested that more online social events be organized to give members more opportunities to know each other. Managers may communicate with users regularly, inviting them to share information and opinions on community issues. This may also increase a user's sense of belonging, which in turn will increase the degree of altruism towards the community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Limitations</head><p>There are several limitations in this study. First, we collected data from a sample of Chinese Wikipedia users. Although we believe that Chinese Wikipedia users do not differ much from other users in terms of their motivations, we could not confirm this without conducting a comparison study. We caution that the findings can be extended to other Wikipedia users or generalized to the whole population of online encyclopedia users. To address this limitation, future research can collect data from other online encyclopedias to see whether the findings of this study apply to other systems. Furthermore, cross-cultural studies can be conducted to investigate the impact of cultures in online encyclopedia systems.</p><p>Second, the data for content contribution and community participation were collected from respondents by survey. Although we examined common research methods and the results showed that the bias was not a major issue, future studies should use objective data to measure a user's behaviors and contributions. Finally, the sample appeared to have a gender bias. The majority of the respondents were male. Although this is consistent with some Wikipedia reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, future research can further explore the potential effect of gender distribution in Wikipedia.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Managers of online encyclopedia systems should be aware that users have different motivations in their participation and that these motivations have different impacts on different aspects of participative behaviors.

Therefore, managers should design different strategies and allocate different resources in promoting users' participative behaviors. A user's content contribution behavior is motivated by the need for self-development and reciprocity. Wikipedia users are often people below age 40 who are motivated to learn information and develop skills. To encourage article writing and editing contributions, managers should understand and help satisfy these users' need for development. Managers should be actively answering user questions, offering help, and providing feedback.</figDesc></figure>
