<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A promising research area in the field of Group Decision Making (GDM) is the study of interpersonal influence and its impact on the evolution of experts' opinions. In conventional GDM models, a group of experts express their individual preferences on a finite set of alternatives, then preferences are aggregated and the best alternative, satisfying the majority of experts, is selected. Nevertheless, in real situations, experts form their opinions in a complex interpersonal environment where preferences are liable to change due to social influence. In order to take into account the effects of social influence during the GDM process, we propose a new influence-guided GDM model based on the following assumptions: experts influence each other and the more an expert trusts in another expert, the more his opinion is influenced by that expert. The effects of social influence are especially relevant to cases when, due to domain complexity, limited expertise or pressure to make a decision, an expert is unable to express preferences on some alternatives, i.e. in presence of incomplete information. The proposed model adopts fuzzy rankings to collect both experts' preferences on available alternatives and trust statements on other experts. Starting from collected information, possibly incomplete, the configuration and the strengths of interpersonal influences are evaluated and represented through a Social Influence Network (SIN). The SIN, in its turn, is used to estimate missing preferences and evolve them by simulating the effects of experts' interpersonal influence before aggregating them for the selection of the best alternative. The proposed model has been experimented with synthetic data to demonstrate the influence driven evolution of opinions and its convergence properties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>GDM is a process by which a group of experts collectively makes a choice among a finite set of available alternatives. GDM has been widely studied since it has applications in many fields. For this reason, many different approaches have been proposed so far for the representation of experts' opinion, for their aggregation, for the selection of the best alternative and for consensus reaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In a GDM process, experts are usually let free to interact and discuss each other exchanging opinions. During these interactions, experts with a wider background, experience and knowledge are capable of influencing This work was supported by the FEDER funds under Grant TIN2016-75850-R.</p><p>N. Capuano is with the Department of Information, Electric Engineering and Applied Mathematics, University of Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, 84084 Fisciano (SA), Italy.

Chiclana is with the School of Computer Science and Informatics, Faculty of Technology, De Montfort University, Leicester LE1 9BH, UK (e-mail: chiclana@dmu.ac.uk). other experts. So, after a discussion, the preferences of each expert may undergo a modification due to social influence. Influence modelling and the appraisal of its effect on opinion change has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Influence is capable of playing a key role in decision making; despite that, the introduction of GDM models that takes into account social influence have just recently been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Following these works, this paper presents an alternative influence-guided GDM model that, instead of considering pre-defined levels of social influence, models influence based on available information regarding experts' interpersonal trust. Elaborating on the definitions provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the concept of trust is interpreted in the proposed framework as the belief of an expert in the capability of another expert in finding the correct solution to a specific problem. Interpersonal trust has been already used to improve the outcomes of a GDM process. According to the models proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, each expert is explicitly asked to express their fuzzy trust statements on the other experts. Such statements are then aggregated and a global level of trust is calculated, associated to each expert and used to weight their opinions in the aggregation step. Instead, we propose to use trust statements to let the opinions of each expert evolve by incorporating elements captured from the opinion expressed by other experts he trusts. Especially in the case of uncertainty it is generally believed that people are influenced by the opinions of people they trust. Information regarding the level of interpersonal trust among the experts is then collected together with opinions on problem alternatives (that may be incomplete). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, incomplete opinions are then completed with data injected from trusted experts. In addition with respect to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, such opinions are further modified by simulating their evolution due to social influence. It is also demonstrated that, under certain assumptions, the evolution of opinions due to influence converges to a final collective opinion. If assumptions are not met, standard aggregation approaches are used to select the best alternative. The paper is organized as follows: section II introduces some background concepts on GDM and related topics while section III discusses the proposed methodology.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES ON GROUP DECISION MAKING</head><p>A GDM problem is characterized by a group of experts = { , … , }, each with their own knowledge, ideas, experience and motivation, who express their preferences on a finite set of alternatives = { , … , } to achieve a common solution. Expert preferences can be expressed in form of rankings <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (alternatives are ordered from the best to the worst), utility vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> (a utility value is assigned to each alternative), fuzzy estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (a linguistic evaluation, translated into a fuzzy number, is assigned to each alternative), preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> (for every pair of alternatives, a preferred one is selected) or fuzzy preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (a degree of preference for each alternative over any other is assigned). Among the existing models, Fuzzy Preference Relations (FPRs) are one of the most diffused. They ensure a high degree of expressiveness in the definition of preferences and, at the same time, translation techniques are available to convert preference information from every other representation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. A FPR P on a set of alternatives X can be formally defined as a fuzzy set on × with a membership function : × → [0,1] so that <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">, =<label>1</label></formula><p>∈ (0.5, 1) 0.5 ∈ (0, 0.5) 0 if is definitely preferred to , if is slightly preferred to , if and are evenly preferred, if is slightly preferred to , if is definitely preferred to .</p><p>(</p><p>A FPR P can be represented as a × matrix = where = ( , ). A FPR satisfying the additive reciprocity property so that + = 1 ∀ , ∈ {1, … , }, is said to be reciprocal. This means that the preference relation is asymmetric, i.e. if is preferred to then is not preferred to and, as a consequence, = 0.5 ∀ ∈ {1, … , } (i.e. any alternative is never preferred to itself). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a FPR satisfying the additive transitivity property, + + = 1.5 ∀ , , ∈ {1, … , }, is said to be additive consistent. Additive transitivity is frequently used for repairing inconsistencies or to estimate missing preferences. Once experts have expressed their preferences, m individual FPRs , … , are available where = for ∈ {1, … , } and , ∈ {1, … , }. Several aggregation rules have been proposed so far to obtain a collective FPR P from a set of individual ones. Among them, the Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) family of operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>[24] is often adopted. A OWA operator of dimension m is a function : [0,1] → [0,1] associated with a list of weights = ( , … ,</p><p>) ∈ [0,1] such that ∑ = 1 . Let ( , … , ) be a list of preference values to aggregate, the OWA operator is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( , … , ) = ( )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where : {1, … } → {1, … } is a permutation function such that ( ) ≥ ( ) for each ∈ {1, … , -1}. Thus, the OWA collective preference is obtained as: = ( , … , ) for , ∈ {1, … , }. The behavior of an OWA operator strictly depends on the used weight vector. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the authors proposed to initialize the weight vector starting from a non-decreasing proportional fuzzy quantifier to let OWA assumes the behavior of soft majority. In this way it is possible to obtain a collective evaluation in which the opinions of most of the experts involved in the decision problem are considered. A proportional fuzzy quantifier Q is as fuzzy subset of the unit interval [0, 1] where, for any ∈ [0,1], ( ) represents the degree to which the proportion y is compatible with the meaning of the quantifier Q <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. A non-decreasing proportional fuzzy quantifier satisfies the additional property:</p><p>( ) ≥ ( ) when &gt; . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows several examples of nondecreasing proportional fuzzy quantifiers with membership functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( ) = 0 &lt; , ( -)/( -) ≤ ≤ , 1 &gt; .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with , , ∈ [0,1]. For example, the parameters ( , ) of the quantifiers shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> are the following: (0, 1), (0, 0.5), (0.3, 0.8) and (0.5, 1) respectively. The quantifier to be applied should be selected to reflect the fusion strategy that the decision makers would apply. Starting from the selected quantifier, the weights of an OWA operator of dimension m are computed as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= - -1 ; ∈ {1, … , }.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>After having selected a non-decreasing proportional fuzzy quantifier Q, extending the notation to matrices, we can write </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=</head><p>( , … , ) where is the OWA operator initialised with the weights coming from the quantifier Q. Alternative aggregation rules, based on OWA and implementing the concept of soft majority have been described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Once the individual FPRs have been aggregated, the available alternatives must be ranked from best to worst by associating a score value ( ) to any ∈ . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> the Quantifier Guided Dominance Degree (QGDD) was defined to calculate the dominance that one alternative has over all the others in a fuzzy majority sense:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">( ) = ; = 1, … , ; ≠ .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In the same paper a Quantifier Guided Non-Dominance Degree was defined to calculate the degree which a given alternative is not dominated by a fuzzy majority of the remaining ones. Instead, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> the score value of each alternative is calculated in terms of Net Flow i.e. the difference between the degree of preference of over all the other alternatives and the degree of preference of all the other alternatives over .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Dealing with Incomplete Information</head><p>Sometimes, due to domain complexity, limited expertise or pressure to make a decision, it may be difficult or even impossible for an expert to express a preference on every pair of alternatives. This results in incomplete FPRs where missing values have to be estimated. Several methods have been proposed so far for this purpose, like the ones in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>[29]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. In particular, we focus on the model discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> because missing values are estimated combining additive reciprocity and additive transitivity properties.</p><p>When an FPR P is additive consistent, an unknown element can be obtained combining known elements of P. Even when user defined FPRs are partially consistent, additive transitivity can be used to identify missing values that are as consistent as possible with the defined ones through a set of estimators. Given an unknown value , the following partial consistency based estimated values can be computed using alternative k: </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">( ) = + -0.</formula><p>A missing value can be so estimated by averaging all partial consistency based estimated values as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">( ) = ∑ ( ) + ( ) + ( ) ; ; 3( -2) .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The generation of missing values is done in several iterations. In each iteration new values are generated based on those previously known. When new values cannot be generated, the process stops.</p><p>The method uses the preferences expressed on a given alternative to infer missing preferences for the same alternative. If no preferences are available for a given alternative, no estimated value can be generated for it. This happens when, to estimate some for , ∈ {1, … , }, both and are undefined for all k. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, the authors refer to this case as an ignorance situation and suggest to use seed values to initialize missing preferences and, then, to apply an iterative process based on ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> to obtain the final estimates. Four different ways to obtain seed values are proposed:</p><p>• indifference: undefined preferences are initially set to 0.5;</p><p>• alternative proximity: seed values are obtained from the preference values given by the same expert to similar alternatives; • collective seed value: seed values are chosen from the collective FPR computed by aggregating partial individual FPRs provided by the experts; • expert proximity: seed values are chosen from the FPRs provided by the experts nearest to the expert whose FPR has to be completed, distances between experts are computed by averaging the absolute differences between defined preferences. The first approach is useful when there are no external sources of information about the problem and when a high FPRs consistency level is required. The second approach implies having additional information on alternatives allowing to define a distance measure between them. The third and fourth approaches, making the opinions of the experts closer, are useful when a fast consensus is needed. In addition, the fourth approach is also able to maintain high the FPRs consistency level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experts' Importance, Consistency and Trust</head><p>When individual FPRs are aggregated into the collective one, it is possible to weight the contribution of each expert in order to reflect their different backgrounds and levels of knowledge about the problem. This is usually achieved by associating an importance degree ∈ [0,1] to each expert ∈ and implementing a specific aggregation operator, that appropriately takes into account such importance degrees in deriving the collective FPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> the Induced OWA (IOWA) operator is introduced for this purpose. With IOWA, the reordering of the set of values to aggregate is induced by the reordering of a set of values associated with them. Based on the same principle, the Importance IOWA operator (I-IOWA) was defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to consider the importance of each preference (i.e. that of the expert expressing such preference) during the aggregation step. This is elaborated below. Let = ( , … , ) be the importance degree of each expert of E, ( , … , ) the list of preference values to aggregate (where is expressed by expert ) and Q a non-decreasing proportional fuzzy quantifier, the I-IOWA operator is defined as follows:</p><p>-( , ), … , ( , ) = ( ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where : {1, … } → {1, … } is a permutation function such that ( ) ≥ ( ) for each ∈ {1, … , -1} and the k-th weight is obtained as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">= ( ) ( ) - ( -1) ( ) ; ∈ {1, … , }.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where ( ) = ∑ ( ) . Extending the notation to matrices, given a set of individual FPRs , … , and a vector of experts' importance degrees U, the collective FPR P that takes into account the importance of each expert can be obtained as = -( , ), … , ( , ) . In some GDM models, the importance degree of each expert is considered as known beforehand or provided by a reliable source while, in other cases, it is obtained in another way. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, the authors suggest to give more importance to the experts that provide more consistent information. In such models, a consistency index is calculated for each expert by analyzing their individual FPRs, which are subsequently used to build the vector U. Many consistency measures have been defined so far for this purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, although the most widely used are based on the concept of additive transitivity property. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> the importance of each expert is calculated basing on data coming from a social network. The tie strength between pairs of experts is calculated through Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques by combining the number of common connections with the number of direct interactions. Then the importance of an expert is obtained as the average strength of his ties with other experts. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the authors propose to use trust as a measure of experts' importance. Based on the history of past actions and behavior, trust reflects the actual reputation of an expert among his peers. Information about interpersonal trust is obtained by analyzing data coming from a type of social network in which the users explicitly express their opinion on other users as fuzzy trust statements. Trust statement related to each expert are aggregated and used to build the vector U. In particular, a linear combination of the consistency index and the trust degree of each expert is used to weight his FPR during the aggregation step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Social Influence and Opinion Change</head><p>A GDM process, from the experts' point of view, only rarely results in expressing own opinions and accepting or rejecting the consensus to other's opinion. In real situations, individuals form their opinions in a complex interpersonal environment in which preferences on available alternatives are liable to change due to social influence. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> social influence is defined as changes in individual's thoughts, feelings, attitudes or behaviors resulting from interaction with another individual or a group. In the same paper, the social influence among experts is calculated by combining the number of common connections with the number of direct interactions over a social network. The use of data coming from social networks to support the decision making process is not new. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> SNA metrics are used to measure inter-organizational relationships with the aim of enhancing a decision making process for project selection. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> a consensus-based model based on SNA has been defined to reconcile conflicts in the collaborative annotation of media content. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> SNA metrics are used for the first time to estimate social influence between experts. The obtained value is then used to infer missing FPR values by combining values coming from influencing experts. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, influence can be modelled through a Social Influence Network (SIN): a directed graph between the set of experts E and where each arc ( , ) has a weight ∈ [0,1] that represents the strength of the influence of the j-th expert on the i-th one. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows an example of SIN. A SIN involving a set of experts = { , … , } can be summarized by an × fuzzy adjacency matrix = . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> it was suggested that the weights , … , are directly chosen by the expert before he is informed of the preferences expressed by the others, on the basis of the relative importance he assigns to the opinion of the various experts, including himself. Selected weights must verify the normalization property ∑ = 1 for all ∈ {1, … , }, i.e. the influences of peers on each expert sum to 1. If ( ) is an × 1 vector representing the initial experts' opinions on a given alternative, it is supposed that, after having interacted, this opinion vector will change to ( ) = ( ) due to interpersonal influence. If we suppose that each expert is informed that the others have changed their opinion, it is reasonable to expect that the expert will change again his opinion according to the same principle. By iterating the process, it is possible to obtain the experts' opinion after t interactions as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">( ) = ( ) .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> it was demonstrated that, if there exists a positive integer t so that every element in at least one column of is positive, then the m opinions are expected to converge to the same value. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> it was suggested to also specify the susceptibility of each expert to interpersonal influence as ∈ [0,1]. Let ( ) be the initial experts' opinions, after t interactions, the updated opinions is obtained iteratively as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">( ) = ( ) + ( -) ( )<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where = ( , … , ) and I is the × identity matrix. In other words, at each time, the current opinion of an expert is obtained as a linear combination of his initial opinion and the influenced opinion he had at the time immediately preceding. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> it was demonstrated that, if the matrixis non-singular and the process reaches an equilibrium, i.e.</p><p>(∞) = lim →∞ ( ) exists, then: </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">w 1,2 w 2,1 w 2,2 w 3,3 w 4,4 w 3,4 w 4,3 w 1,3 w 3,1 w 2,4 w 4,2 w 1,4 w 2,3 w 4,1 w 3,2 ( ) = ( - ) ( -) ( ) .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">11</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>) were applied for the first time in a GDM process where the experts provide opinions on a set of alternatives = { , … , } rather than on just one. For each expert , the initial degree of preference ( ) on each alternative is calculated starting from expert's individual FPR via the application of the QGDD metric to all preference values of the j-th row of the corresponding FPR.</p><p>Then, the influence model is applied on each column of the × matrix ( ) = ( ) by extending equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>) to matrices and obtaining: ( ) = ( -) ( -) ( ) . The i-th row of ( ) represents the "influenced" preferences of the expert after having introjected his peers' opinions. The I-IOWA operator is then applied to aggregate such influenced preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. A NEW INFLUENCE-GUIDED FUZZY MODEL FOR GDM</head><p>The proposed model is aimed at taking into account social influence within a GDM process both in general and in the presence of incomplete information. The research assumptions on which the proposed model is built are two: experts influence each other and the more an expert trusts in the capability of another expert, the more his opinion is influenced by the trusted expert. This has immediate applications in presence of incomplete information i.e. when experts cannot express an opinion on any of the available alternatives. Trust statements collected among experts are used to initialize a SIN that is in turn employed to improve provided preferences and to estimate the missing ones. To make the model immediately applicable in practice, we have chosen fuzzy rankings (defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>) as the representation format for preferences expression since they are user friendly and less vulnerable to inconstancy than FPRs. The same representation format is used for both the opinions on alternatives and the trust statements on experts. Given a set of experts = { , … , } and a set of alternatives = { , … , }, the proposed model works through the following steps: for ∈ {1, … , } are aggregated through OWA to obtain the collective FPR P. 8. alternative selection: the dominance degree ( ) is estimated for each alternative ∈ according to P, then alternatives are ranked from the best to the worst and the first one is selected. The information flow among the described steps is summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> while the next subsections provide details on each step. In particular subsection III.A deals with the collection of opinions and trust statements and their conversion to FPRs (steps 1-3); subsection III.B explains how the SIN is generated and applied to estimate missing preferences (steps 4-5); subsection III.C deals with the application of the influence model on obtained FPRs, their aggregation and alternative selection (steps 6-8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Preferences Collection and FPRs Generation</head><p>Although FPRs are among the most commonly used methods to express preferences on different alternatives, they are not free from drawbacks. First of all, especially when dealing with a large number of alternatives, the definition of a FPRs may become complex and time-consuming. Moreover, while they allow to focus on only two options at a time, this can let the expert lose the global perception of the problem with the risk of introducing inconsistency that subsequently could impact negatively on the decision process. For these reasons, alternative representation formats of preferences are often adopted in real GDM settings and, if necessary, transformation functions are applied A fair compromise between expressiveness and easiness is represented by fuzzy rankings as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> where experts rank the available alternatives and express the grade to which each alternative is better than the subsequent compared one. A fuzzy ranking can be represented through a finite sequence = ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">( ) … ( ) ( ) with ≤ .</formula><p>Terms in odd positions in the sequence represent a subset of the alternatives, while : {1, … } → {1, … } is a k-permutation function. Terms in even positions belong to the set of symbols = {≫, &gt;, ≥, ≈} and define a degree of preference between subsequent terms (with ≫ meaning "is much better than", &gt; "is better than", ≥ "is a little better than" and ≈ "is similar to"). Each alternative appears at most once in the ranking so cycles are not allowed although partial rankings are admitted. Inspired by studies on the use of linguistic labels in GDM like <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, the cardinality of S has been chosen small enough so as not to impose useless precision to the experts and rich enough to allow a discrimination of the relative performance of the alternatives. On the other hand, the possibility to compose fuzzy rankings by chaining alternatives and symbols, allows to indirectly express a wide variety of preferences levels. Starting from a fuzzy ranking it is possible to generate a FPR as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, where a fuzzy preference degree is associated to each symbol of S. Unfortunately, doing so the generated FPR is not guaranteed to be additive consistent. For this reason, we propose a new transformation function based on the one defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> which leads to additive consistent FPRs. A relative strength |s| is associated to each symbol ∈ , where |≫| = 2, |&gt;| = 1, |≥| = 0.5 and |≈| = 0 and, given a fuzzy ranking R, a crispy rank ( ) is associated to each alternative so that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">• ( ( ) ) = 1; • ( ) = ( ) + | | ∀ ∈ {2, … , }; • ( ) is undefined if ( ) is undefined i.e.</formula><p>if the i-th alternative does not appear in R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> Then, for any pair of alternatives and present in a fuzzy ranking R, the following preference value can be defined:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">= 1 2 1 + ( ) -( ) -1<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where = ( ( ) ) is the maximum rank. The special case = 1, occurring when an expert considers all alternatives in the fuzzy ranking equally in terms of preference, is handled by setting = 0.5. It is easy to demonstrate that the existing elements of the obtained FPR P verify the additive consistency property (see appendix). It should be noted that the relative strength of each symbol has been selected so that, apart from ≈, each symbol doubles the relative strength of the next one. By only using the symbol &gt;, the fuzzy ranking becomes a simple ordering of alternatives and equations ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>) become the same defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The use of the symbols ≫ or ≥ in place of &gt; respectively doubles or halves the distance of the preceding and subsequent terms in the ranking while the use of ≈ means that the preceding and subsequent terms have the same rank. As an option, experts may be allowed to provide a set of fuzzy rankings, interesting disjoint subsets of X, rather than just one. In this way it is possible to deal with the case in which an expert judges some options as mutually incomparable. To obtain an additive consistent FPR even in this case, it is enough to iterate equation ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) on any provided fuzzy ranking. Fuzzy rankings are used in our model to let experts express their opinion with respect to (a subset of) the alternatives as well as their trust on (a subset of) the experts. More formally, each expert ∈ provides a fuzzy ranking on the set of alternatives in X and a fuzzy ranking on the set of experts E (including himself). Starting from and , by applying equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>), the corresponding (incomplete) FPRs and are computed and taken forward to the next steps. Being m the number of experts and n the number of alternatives, the time complexity of this step is ( • ). To clarify the concept, consider the following example.</p><p>Example 1. Let us suppose that we have a set of five alternatives = { , , , , } and a set of three experts = { , , }, that expert provides the fuzzy ranking of alternatives: = ≫ ≈ ≥ and the fuzzy ranking of experts:</p><p>= ≫ ≈ . In the expert states that the alternative is much better than which in turn is similar to . The latter in turn is a little better than . Moreover he has no opinion at all on . In the expert states that he thinks that the expert is much more trustable than (himself) who in turn is trustable as . Starting from and , by applying equations ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>), the following associated FPRs are obtained: = 0.5 0.4 -0 0.4 0.6 0.5 -0.1 0.5 -----1 0.9 -0.5 0.9 0.6 0.5 -0.1 0.5 ; = 0.5 0 0.5 1 0.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Using Social Influence to Estimate Missing Preferences</head><p>When some experts express their opinions only on a subset of available alternatives, incomplete FPRs (i.e. FPRs with some undefined values) are generated through equations ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>). In particular, if the i-th alternative does not appear in a given fuzzy ranking R, then both the i-th row and the i-th column of the corresponding FPR P remains undefined (e.g. alternative in example 1). As seen in II.A, this is considered an ignorance situation that can be solved by selecting seed values to initialize the missing preferences and by iterating the equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) until the convergence is reached and the final estimates obtained. Several methods have been proposed so far to obtain seed values (as described in II.A). Here we propose to obtain seed values from preferences provided by the experts that are trusted by the one whose FPR has to be completed. This is to say that, when an expert is asked to evaluate an unknown alternative, he forms his judgment using the opinion of experts he trusts. To do that, we firstly generate a SIN starting from the opinions on experts collected in for ∈ {1, … , }. Then, any missing preference in for ∈ {1, … , } is estimated according to the generated SIN. As explained in II.C, a SIN is characterized by a fuzzy adjacency matrix = ( ) where each element ∈ [0,1] represents the strength of the influence of the l-th expert on the kth one for , ∈ {1, … , }. So, the elements of k-th row of W can be obtained from through FPR measures defined in section II like QGDD. To comply the SIN property so that ∑ = 1 , a normalization step is needed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">= ( ) ∑ ( )<label>(16)</label></formula><p>and:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">( ) = ; = 1, … , : is defined . (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>Undefined elements of are not considered in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">17</ref>); when the l-th row of is undefined (i.e. when expresses no preferences on ) ( ) = 0; in the special case which the kth expert only trusts himself, we obtain via equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">16</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">17</ref>):</p><p>= 0 for ≠ and = 1 meaning that the expert is not influenced by any other. Based on the generated SIN, a missing preference of an FPR coming from is estimated through the I-IOWA operator (defined in II.A) where the preferences to aggregate come from all the defined FPRs with ∈ {1, … , } while the importance degrees, which represent the trust degree of on each expert of E, come from W. Basing on equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), a missing preference is so estimated as follows:</p><p>= -, ;</p><p>= 1, … , : is defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Undefined elements of with ∈ {1, … , } are not considered in equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. If seed values for some preferences are still missing (e.g. when the same preferences are missing in the FPRs of any trusted expert), then the estimation process based on equation ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) is repeated on FPRs injected with estimated values. The process is re-iterated until no additional seed values can be calculated. Then, the final estimates are computed through the iterative application of equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) until convergence is reached. In some cases it is possible that some FPR still remain partially undefined. Given an FPR and an alternative ∈ , when none of the experts (directly or indirectly) trusted by have an opinion on i.e. when and are undefined for any ∈ {1, … , } and any l so that a path (that excludes 0-weighted arcs) from to exists in the SIN, then both the i-th row and the ith column of remain undefined. In case the SIN is a connected graph this means that all experts have no opinion on . This suggests that the alternative is of no interest for the whole group so it can be removed from X. Conversely, in case the SIN is disconnected, it is possible that other (untrusted) experts have provided an opinion on . In such cases can't be removed and remaining undefined FPRs elements must be estimated through a different method among those discussed in II.A (e.g. through indifference by setting the seed value to 0.5). Assuming that OWA and I-IOWA operators use state-of-the-art sorting algorithms, the overall time complexity of the SIN generation step is ( • log ). Instead, the time complexity of the preference estimation step is affected by the number of missing preferences and can be asymptotically limited by Ω ( • ) and ( • log ).</p><p>Example 2. Let E, X, and be as reported in example 1, by applying equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">16</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">17</ref>) with values from and using the fuzzy quantifier (0,1) corresponding to the linguistic label "much" (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) to guide the OWA operator, the obtained weights are: , = 0.17; , = 0.17; , = 0.66; meaning that, to complete , values from are weighted 0.17 while values from are weighted 0.66 (the first weight is irrelevant given that it refers to expert self-trust). Let suppose that the experts and specify the fuzzy rankings: = ≈ &gt; &gt; and = ≈ ≥ ≫ .

By iteratively applying equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) until convergence and injecting the last estimations in , the FPR coming from is completed as follows (where injected values are reported in bold): </p></div>

The aim is to predict the final decision that will be adopted by the group of experts as a result of interaction, without the need to actually perform such interaction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION</head><p>This section describes two in silico experiments of the proposed methodology aimed at illustrating its operational steps and its convergence properties. Eventually, a qualitative comparison with other existing methods is proposed.</p><p>A. First Case: Convergence of Experts' Opinions Let = { , , , , , } be a set of experts that have to choose the best alternative among those available in the set = { , , , , , , , , , }. According to the defined model, experts use fuzzy rankings to express both their preferences on alternatives and their trust on other experts. Defined fuzzy rankings are reported in the second and third columns of Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. As it can be seen, many experts provide incomplete information both with respect to alternatives and to other experts. For example just evaluates 7 alternatives over 10 and express his trust on 4 experts over 6. Applying equations ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>), the fuzzy rankings on alternatives are converted into FPRs (see Table <ref type="table">II</ref>). As it can be seen, many elements remain undefined given the incompleteness of experts' opinion. The same process is repeated with fuzzy rankings of experts and obtained FPRs (that are not reported for reasons of brevity) are, in turn, used to build an SIN via equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">16</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. It is important to note that, even if information on trust is incomplete, the SIN generation process is able to initialize any SIN weight. The obtained SIN, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>, can be summarized by the following fuzzy adjacency matrix: = 0.26 0.45 0 0.17 0.12 0 0 0.22 0.32 0.22 0.17 0.07 0 0.20 0.44 0 0.11 0.25 0.16 0.16 0.22 0.29 0.09 0.09 0.09 0.09 0.34 0 0.28 0.21 0 0.25 0 0.11 0.20 0.44 .</p><p>Applying the process described in section III.B it is then possible to estimate missing preferences by injecting external seeds from trusted experts (according to the SIN) and consolidate them through harmonization with existing preferences using the additive consistency property process described in section II.A. Completed FPRs are reported in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. To make these results more readable, we apply equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">24</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">25</ref>) to obtain back the completed fuzzy rankings after the injection of external preferences. They are reported in the last column of Table <ref type="table">I</ref> for comparison with the initial rankings. The next step consists in executing the process described in section III.C to let experts' preferences evolve according to social influence. The process is expected to converge since at least one column of W has all positive elements. In fact, after 5 iterations, the experts' preferences converge to the same collective FPR P reported below: = 0.5 0.58 0.4 0.39 0.44 0.51 0.59 0.61 0.67 0.36 0.4 0.5 0.31 0.24 0.32 0.43 0.48 0.51 0.59 0.23 0.57 0.67 0.5 0.46 0.51 0.61 0.69 0.71 0.71 0.44 0.46 0.67 0.38 0.5 0.46 0.6 0.56 0.58 0.63 0.37 0.54 0.68 0.46 0.45 0.5 0.6 0.67 0.69 0.68 0.42 0.47 0.57 0.37 0.31 0.4 0.5 0.53 0.57 0.66 0.29 0.3 0.42 0.2 0.21 0.23 0.36 0.5 0.42 0.45 0.17 0.35 0.46 0.25 0.26 0.29 0.4 0.46 0.5 0.5 0.24 0.25 0.35 0.2 0.17 0.25 0.27 0.35 0.38 0.5 0.12 0.61 0.77 0.53 0.53 0.58 0.71 0.73 0.73 0.8 0.5</p><p>From P by applying equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) to calculate the dominance degrees: ( ) = 0.51, ( ) = 0.39, ( ) = 0.6, ( ) = 0.52, ( ) = 0.58, ( ) = 0.46, ( ) = 0.31, ( ) = 0.36, ( ) = 0.26, ( ) = 0.67. So, the best alternative is . In addition, the obtained dominance degrees can be used to generate the following ranking of alternatives:  </p></div>

The figure also allows to easily perceive the final ranking between alternatives but also observe the process dynamics that led to the generation of the final decision. For example, it can be noticed that the most controversial alternatives have been and since the convergence on them was reached later than for the other alternatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Second Case: Lack of Convergence</head><p>A special case for the model is when the matrix W does not respect the conditions for convergence. Let suppose that the six experts of the previous example provide the same opinions on alternatives but different fuzzy rankings of experts (as shown in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref>). By applying equations ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>), the fuzzy rankings of experts are converted in FPRs and, then, used to build an SIN via equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">16</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. The obtained SIN, shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, can be summarized by the following fuzzy adjacency matrix: = 0.61 0.28 0.11 0 0 0 0.17 0.67 0.17 0 0 0 0.33 0.33 0.33 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.67 0.17 0.17 0 0 0 0.17 0.67 0.17 0 0 0 0.5 0 0.5 .</p><p>Like in the previous case, the experts are initially in disagreement but, unlike the previous case, they grant their trust only to a small subset of colleagues so as to create two unconnected   subgroups. As it can be seen from the figure (but it is also evident from the matrix W), experts , and do not provide trust information regarding experts , and so their preferences are not mutually influenced by the model. It is easy to demonstrate that W does not meet the conditions for convergence since it is impossible to find a positive integer l so that every element in at least one column of is positive. So it is expected that the influence process does not converge. Since the fuzzy rankings about alternatives are the same as in the previous example, after conversion, the obtained FPRs are the same already shown in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. Obtained FPRs are then completed according to the new SIN and used as input for the influence model (the last column of Table IV reports the completed FPRs converted back into fuzzy rankings). After 8 interactions, each of the two subgroups of experts reaches internal consensus on a single FPR but the FPRs obtained by the two subgroups of experts are different (the two FPRs are reported in Table <ref type="table">V</ref>). The evolution of the dominance degree of the first two alternatives is exemplified in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) is then used to aggregate the FPRs coming from the two subgroups of experts and the resulting dominance degree associated to each alternative is: ( ) = 0.48, ( ) = 0.39, ( ) = 0.51, ( ) = 0.43, ( ) = 0.49, ( ) = 0.54, ( ) = 0.36, ( ) = 0.34, ( ) = 0.28, ( ) = 0.6. Again, the final group solution is , although the new collective fuzzy ranking of alternatives is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">≫ ≈ ≥ ≈ &gt; ≫ &gt; ≥ ≥ ≫ &gt; ≈ ≥ ≈ ≫ ≫ &gt; ≈ &gt; ≥ ≫ ≥ ≈ ≫ ≈ ≥ ≫ ≥ ≫ ≈ ≈ ≥ &gt; &gt; ≈ &gt; ≫ &gt; &gt; ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≫ ≫ ≫ ≥ &gt; ≈ ≈ ≥ &gt; ≥ &gt; ≈ &gt; &gt; ≈ ≥ ≫ ≈ ≥ &gt; &gt; ≥ ≈ ≫ &gt; ≫ &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ≥ ≈ &gt; ≫ ≥ &gt; &gt; ≥ ≈ ≥ &gt; ≈ &gt; ≫ &gt; ≈ &gt; ≈ ≫ ≫ ≥ ≫ ≥ &gt; &gt; &gt; Fig 6.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">≫ &gt; ≥ ≈ &gt; &gt; &gt; ≥ ≫ .</formula></div>

In addition (like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) we also use influence as a mean to estimate missing preferences in case of incomplete information. This is possible because, in our model, influence evolution can be operated directly on experts' FPRs rather than on utility vectors extracted from FPRs (like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>).</p><p>Simulating the natural evolution of opinions thanks to discussion, our model also tries to obtain the convergence between the experts' opinions. This is a distinctive feature with respect to existing models because social influence also impacts the preferences aggregation phase. In such sense, our model can be also used to support automated consensus processes. Table VI summarizes the differences and the advantages of the proposed model with respect to other existing ones.</p><p>V. CONCLUSIONS Despite its prominent role in opinion formation, social influence seems to be almost disregarded by current GDM models. Aiming at filling this gap, we have developed in this paper a new GDM model able to take into account social influence between experts during the process and to estimate how experts' opinion change according to its effects. In this model the concept of social influence is strictly interconnected with that of interpersonal trust according to the intuition that the more an expert trusts in the capability of another expert, the more his opinion is influenced by the trusted expert, especially in presence of incomplete information i.e. when experts are unable to express an opinion on any of the alternatives. Fuzzy rankings are used to represent experts' opinions regarding both their preferences on the set of alternatives and their trust on other experts. This opinion representation format is user friendly and less vulnerable to inconstancy than commonly used FPRs. Fuzzy rankings of experts are used to build an SIN that specifies the structure and the level of experts' interpersonal influence. The network is used, in turn, to estimate missing preferences and to let them evolve simulating the effects of experts' interaction before aggregating them for the selection of the best alternative. The time complexity of the whole process is polynomial and limited by ( • ) where m is the number of experts and n the number of alternatives. It has been also demonstrated that under certain conditions, experts' opinion naturally converge to a final collective opinion. We believe that the defined model leads to a more accurate representation of the GDM process by formalizing important aspects that are usually disregarded by other models. On the other hand, we estimate the level of social influence based on interpersonal trust without considering other psychological traits like leadership, charisma, persuasive ability, etc. that could strengthen or weaken influence when real interactions between experts take place. Nevertheless, we believe that the exclusion of these additional traits is advantageous and enables to reach more objective decisions.</p></div>

In particular we prove below two statements made in sections III.A and III.C. Proposition 1 (additive consistency of FPRs generated from fuzzy rankings). If P is a × FPR generated from a fuzzy ranking R according to equations ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>), then the elements of P that exist verify the additive consistency property.</p></div>

Based on equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>) we can write:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">+ + = 1 2 1 + -( ) -1 + + 1 2 1 + ( ) - -1 + 1 2 1 + ( ) -( ) -1 = = 3 2 + -( ) + ( ) - + ( ) -( ) 2 -2 .</formula><p>For ≠ 1 and because its fraction numerator is 0, we have that + + = 3 2 ⁄ + 0 = 1.5 proofing that P is additive consistent. The case = 1, which leads to a 0 0 ⁄ indeterminate form, is treated separately in section III.A by setting = 0.5 ∀ , ∈ {1, … , }. In this case the proof that P is additive consistent is trivial given that: + + = 0.5 + </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

If = (0,1) in equation ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) and there exists a positive integer l so that every element in at least one column of the SIN fuzzy adjacency matrix is positive, then all the FPRs ( ) for ∈ {1, … , } converge to the same FPR.</p><p>Proof. Combining equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> with the definition of the I-IOWA operator provided by equations ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), we obtain that, being ( ) a generic element belonging to the FPR ( ) for ∈ {1, … , } and &gt; 1:</p><p>where ( ) = ∑ ( ) and : {1, … } → {1, … } is a permutation function so that ( ) ≥ ( ) for ∈ {1, … , }. Being = (0,1), by substituting = 0 and = 1 in equation ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) we obtain ( ) = = for 0 ≤ ≤ 1. Given that ( ) and ( ) are positive number so that ( ) ≥ ( ) for 1 ≤ ≤ , then we can say that 0 ≤ (</p><p>. By substituting this in the preceding equation we obtain:</p><p>Given that W is the fuzzy adjacency matrix of a SIN, thanks to equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> we have that ∑ = 1 for any ∈ {1, … , }. Being a permutation function, ∑ ( ) simply sum the same elements in a different order so we can say that ∑ ( ) = 1 too. By substituting this in the preceding equation we obtain:</p><p>If we build the vector ( ) = ( ) , … , ( ) including the same preference as expressed by all the m experts we can generalize the preceding equation using matrix notation as ( ) = ( ) = ( ) . As explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, W can be regarded as the one-step transition probability matrix of a Markov chain with m states and stationary transition probabilities. If there exists a positive integer l so that every element in at least one column of is positive then the Markov chain is said regular and, thanks to the limit theorem for regular finite Markov chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, it exists a value p so that lim </p></div>			</div>
