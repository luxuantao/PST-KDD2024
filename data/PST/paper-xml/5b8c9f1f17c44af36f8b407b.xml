<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Additive manufacturing (AM) provides an opportunity to design and produce components with complex shape and topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, current design for manufacturing (DFM) methods are mainly developed for traditional manufacturing processes. Thus, to take full advantage of the unprecedented capability of the AM process, design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) methods need to be developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Typical DFAM methods include topology optimization, design for multi-scale structures (lattice or cellular structures), multi-material design, part consolidation, and other design methods which can make use of AM-enabled features. Particularly, lattice structures have many superior properties, which make it a promising solution for various applications, such as lightweight structures due to high specific stiffness and strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, heat exchangers due to large surface area <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, energy absorbers due to ability to undergo great deformation at a relatively low stress level, and acoustic insulators due to its large number of internal pores <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In addition, topology optimization is a well-established digital design tool for optimizing the distribution of material in the design domain, such that a certain objective is minimized subject to design and response constraints.</p><p>However, there are still some problems when using lattice infill and standard topology optimization to design structures for AM. Traditional lattice structures are often of a regular or random pattern, which is selected by the user in the commercial software with a specific volume percentage or reconstruction from the CT images of the real natural object, such as bone structures. The internal structure of natural bone is a functionally graded cellular structure (FGCS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and the stress distribution of a mechanical part also exhibits a variable-density form.</p><p>Therefore, the functionally graded lattice structure is more reasonable for optimum structural design. Additionally, conventional topology optimization is performed only to minimize the compliance of the design while constraining the overall volume fraction to a target value. The optimized structure tends to generate a numerous of overhang structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which need support structures added so that it is manufacturable. However, some support structures are difficult to remove. Further, conventional topology optimization algorithm usually solves the discrete void or solid design problem by converting the design variable that varies continuously from 0 to 1. Moreover, some isolated solid and some intermediate relative densities would be converted to 0 or 1 to produce the physically meaningful design. Besides, the optimized result needs to convert to a smoothed CAD model before it can be manufactured.</p><p>To overcome these issues, we present a generative design optimization method for the generation of stress aware functionally graded cellular structures. This approach combines the advantages of topology optimization with lattice design to further improve stiffness and manufacturability. It maximizes the mechanical stiffness by optimizing the cellular materials distribution in a given design domain and under a given external load. In particular, to generate graded cellular structures, we present a gyroid-based function representation (F-Rep) method to obtain continuous cellular structures. The smoothed result can be generated from implicit modeling algorithm directly, which can avoid computationally expensive Boolean operations of traditional lattice infill method. Also, the effective mechanical properties of the cellular structures are calculated by using computational homogenization methodology and described by anisotropic constitutive laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. For validation purposes, the structural robustness of the optimized structures belong to various design cases are analyzed through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and experiment further.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Works</head><p>In DFAM areas, much research has been focused on the optimization of geometric shapes and topology structures with specific physical properties. In this section, we review the optimization of mechanical properties techniques related to this work.</p><p>Infill Optimization for AM: Infill optimization is not only for obtaining a lighter weight structure, but also for achieving a sufficiently large stiffness. Similar to 2D texture mapping, Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> presented a 3D texture design method which maps lattice into a design space to generate internal structures, and this system is based on a microstructure library. Inspired by the construction of truss structures, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> optimized the mechanical stiffness of an object by using a "skin-frame" structure to support interior of the object. Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> introduced a honeycomb-cell structure by gradually carving out the interior of an object, but the enclosed hollowed cells make it difficult to remove the internal supporting materials. Thus, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> developed a support-free hollowing algorithm based on the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> introduced a technique to control the parameters of the microstructures so that they can vary spatially to produce graded materials. The technique is combined with a cross-sectional stress analysis method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to reinforce a part. Additionally, many researchers have taken manufacturability of AM into account. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed a rhombic cell which was self-supporting. As a concurrent work, Xie and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> suggested a similar support-free interior carving by the rhombic cell for 3D printing. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> developed a gyroid-based functionally graded lattice structure for buoyancy optimization and proved that the gyroid structure was self-supporting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gyroid Structure:</head><p>The gyroid structure is discovered by NASA scientist Alan Schoen in 1970 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which is designed for lightweight high-strength new materials. Due to AM techniques, the geometric and mechanical properties of gyroid structures have been extensively studied. Yan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>[25] used SLM (selective laser melting) method to evaluated the manufacturability and mechanical properties of gyroid lattice structures with different density, and unit cell sizes ranging from 2 to 8 mm can be manufactured without external support structures.</p><p>Besides, Hussein et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Strano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> used gyroid structure as support structures of parts for AM.</p><p>Additionally, Khaderi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> analyzed the stiffness and strength of the gyroid lattice by finite element method (FEM). Yánez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proved that gyroid titanium structures has versatile stiffness and strength to be used for correction of bone defects. Ataee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> also used gyroid structures for bone implant applications by electron beam melting (EBM).</p><p>Topology Optimization: Topology optimization is a mathematical method that optimizes material distribution within a given design space, for a given set of loads, boundary conditions and constraints with the goal of maximizing the performance of the system. The most common method is homogenization based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>[32], solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>[34] <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, level-set method <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>[37], bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>[39] and the various algorithms they derived. The BESO algorithm is a finite element-based topology optimization approach, where the inefficient material is iteratively removed from a structure while the efficient material is simultaneously added to the structure. The basic principle of SIMP algorithm is to calculate the evolution of relative density distribution of the elements over the design space.</p><p>For a detailed description of SIMP and BESO topology optimization techniques, see the recent survey articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In this paper, we establish the scaling law <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> of an elastic matrix of the lattice structures by the homogenization theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Next, the optimal density distribution of a component is calculated by this scaling law added optimization algorithm. Besides, different from the original SIMP method, we convert the design variable to cellular structures that varies continuously from ρ min to ρ max .</p><p>Functionally Graded Cellular Structure: FGCS is a type of functionally graded material (FGM), FGM is mainly designed by having a variable proportion of composite materials with random microstructures, while FGCS is mainly focused on the density-variable lattice or porous structures design according to the physical and mechanical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Here we focus on discussing topology optimization based the relative density mapping approach. Brackett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> first proposed a SIMP based density mapping approach to map the intermediate densities to lattice cells of varying volume fraction in 2D. Several similar techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> were proposed to optimize the cellular structures using relative density directly from the SIMP method. Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> used irregular honeycomb cellular structure as the distribution materials. Furthermore, Zhang and Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>[47] took the anisotropic property of cellular materials into account by the homogenization method. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> proposed a method to generate a spatially varying structure of FGM with target properties from CT image or topology optimization. Besides, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> developed a two-scale structure synthesis method to generate anisotropic microstructures in the design domain. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> used an efficient homogenization-based topology optimization method to generate variable-density honeycomb cellular structure for natural frequency optimization.</p><p>Tang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> proposed a BESO based design method for truss-like lattice structure optimization. Daynes et al.</p><p>[52] presented a combined methodology of topology optimization and size optimization. Additionally, Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> presented a new approach to the generation of bone-like porous structures based on topology optimization method.</p><p>Moreover, the structural robustness of the optimized bone-like porous structure was discussed. The optimized porous structure was verified to have the ability to resist undefined loads and local damage. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> proposed a level-set based topology optimization method to design connectable graded microstructures, and the optimized structures have good manufacturability. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>[7] generated the graded lattice structures to optimize the heat conduction of the object based on level set method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>The proposed design methodology for cellular structure optimization mainly consists of two parts: functionally graded cellular structures design and optimization procedure, which is illustrated in the flowchart in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Firstly, for the FGCS design part, we present an implicit function to generate the gyroid structures of uniformly varying density based on the previously established relationship between the parametric equation of gyroids and the volume fraction in Section 4. Moreover, the geometric continuity and connectivity of the structure are optimized. Secondly, in this methodology, the effective mechanical properties of gyroid-based cellular structures are described by anisotropic constitutive laws. In addition, we assume that the elastic constants in the anisotropic model are exponential functions of the relative density, which are determined by using computational homogenization method.</p><p>Based on a set of computational data, a formulation of relative density is proposed to represent the equivalent material properties of the specific cellular structure. In Section 5, for the optimization procedure, the penalization formulation in standard structure optimization is replaced by the fitted homogenized model. The exact relative density of a certain cell will be determined by solving the structural optimization problem. Lastly, further validation of the introduced object is conducted via experimental tests on 3D printed samples in Section 6. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Geometric properties</head><p>Most lattice structures are made up of arrays of slender members that resemble familiar lightweight super-structures such as bridges and building frames. But not all lattice structures comprise simple strut and node arrangements. In this work, we choose gyroid structure, which is a typical triply periodic level surface (TPLS) and has been discovered to exist in nature stably. The main advantages of gyroid structure are: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The open-cell foam structure which enables easy removal of powder or liquid resin. (2) The self-support helical structure which does not require any supporting materials during additive manufacturing. (3) High specific surface area and low relative density while retaining higher specific strengths than regular diamond lattices in certain circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Furthermore, a gyroid structure has a wider connectivity area than other types of TPLS structures, such as Schwarz Diamond and Schwarz Primitive, when the level parameter is variable. All of these advantages indicate the usefulness of gyroid structures towards topological design for lattice materials.</p><p>Triply periodic level surfaces represent the solution to scalar-valued functions of three independent variables. The three independent variables can be considered as the x, y, and z coordinates of a point in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The equation of gyroid level surface is composed of trigonometric functions F:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">3 RR  at point   3</formula><p>,, x y z R  , and a close approximation to the gyroid is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">  Gyroid , , =sin 2 cos 2 sin 2 cos 2 sin 2 cos 2 x y y z z x F x y z t L L L L L L                                                 (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where L is the cubic unit cell edge length, and the level parameter t is a variable and determines the volume fractions pertaining to the regions separated by the surface. The lattice structures are subjected to translation and scaling and pinched off into unconnected blobs as the value of the parameter t becomes sufficiently negative or A distinct advantage of using mathematical expressions to define the lattice structures is that a desired number of parameters can be assigned to the model, so that a subsequent architecture optimization for cellular materials study can be carried out with relative ease. The possible values for t and the resulting structures are discussed below:  t = 0: The minimal gyroid surface divides space into two helical regions, each claiming a volume fraction of 50%, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>. When one of the areas is closed, a lattice structure with a volume fraction of 50% is obtained (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>).  0&lt;|t|&lt;1.41: With the increase of t, the proportions of A and B regions also monotonously increase or decrease.</p><p>When t is positive, the volume fraction increases in the positive direction. When t is negative, the volume fraction decreases in the negative direction. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref> and<ref type="figure">d</ref>, it is unit cell and 3×3 cells of gyroid when t is equal to -1.31.  |t|=1.41: For this value, the so-called "pinch-off" (i.e., disconnects) surface is generated, and the surface will be disconnected (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2e</ref> and<ref type="figure">f</ref>). For a low density, such a structure loses its mechanical properties, and for high density, the resulting enclosed area prevents the removal of powder or liquid for AM technique.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Morphological optimization</head><p>The pinch-off problem is an important flaw based on TPLS modeling. Basically, all TPLS-based cellular structures have geometric discontinuities problems. For example, the volume fractions of Schwarz Primitive and Schwarz Diamond structures are about 25% at pinch-off, and that of gyroid structure is about 10%. When the cellular is no longer continuous, not only the design space is limited, but also the broken area will make the structure fragile, and the closed cells make the manufacturability poor. The gyroid structure has been widely used because of its excellent mechanical properties and self-supporting ability when used in AM. In this work, in order to solve the pinch-off problem, the original equation is locally optimized. A penalty function is added into Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> </head><p>, 0 1.41 , , , 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> 1.5</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Gyroid Gyroid Gyroid Ft F F x y z t             (2)</formula><p>where φ(x, y, z) is the penalty function. Since the porous structure of gyroid exhibits an approximately spherical shape, we construct a ball-shaped triple-period structure to adjust morphology of the gyroid shape. Moreover, the penalty function is expressed as: </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">               </formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">       <label>(3)</label></formula><p>where (0.45*t-0.58) control the punishing intensity of the shape. The larger the level parameter t is, the more severe the pinch-off is (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2g</ref>), so the penalty strength needs to increase with the t value. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a~d</ref> are the pinch-off optimization process. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref> and f are the optimized morphology results with |t|=1.41. Compared with the original gyroid structure, the pinch-off phenomenon is disappeared. Even if |t| is large, the optimized gyroid also has geometric continuity (see Fig. <ref type="figure">g</ref> and<ref type="figure">h</ref>). The relative density, or the volume fraction of the solid phase, is an important parameter for cellular materials that is usually used as a variable to express other properties, such as elastic modulus and yield stress. It is essential to acquire the relationship between parameter t and relative density ρ G for gyroid lattice structure. According to Eq.</p><p>(2), we generate structures of different densities of gyroids and calculate their volume fractions, respectively. The data plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> reflect how the relative density of gyroid structure changed with the level parameter t.</p><p>Moreover, it shows that the relative density increases linearly with t. The best fitting of data gives the scaling laws of relative density for gyroid structure as follows: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Mechanical properties</head><p>The mechanical properties of a cellular structure depend directly on the shape and topology of cells. In this work, we choose the gyroid lattice structure as the basic cell, not only because of its controllable geometrical morphology and compact mathematical expression, but also for its excellent mechanical properties. Relative density ρ r is an important characteristic of cellular structures. According to the Gibson-Ashby model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>[12], the elastic modulus E, shear modulus G, and yield strength σ pl of cellular structures are functions of the relative density. These functions are called "scaling laws". In the case of the elastic modulus E, the scaling law follows the form E c /E*=f(ρ r ), in which E c and E* are elastic moduli of the cellular structure and constituent material, respectively, and f(ρ r ) is a polynomial or power function of the relative density ρ r .</p><p>The mechanical behavior of a cellular structure is generally anisotropic. According to Simone and Gibson <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a scaling law for anisotropic cellular structures also exists. In this work, a simple and straightforward numerical homogenization technique proposed by Steven <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is used to obtain the effective stiffness matrix of the non-continuum, periodic lattice structures. In Hooke's law, {σ} =[C]{ε}, unknow constants of the fourth-order stiffness matrix C can be reduced from 81 to 21 due to the symmetry in an orthogonal system.

The elastic anisotropy of lattice structures is highly dependent on the volume fraction. From the result, it can be seen that Young's modulus of Grid lattice and X lattice have significant changes along with different directions. However, gyroid and Grid-Octet lattice structures have less variation along with different directions. In addition, stress analysis is performed in the z-axis direction as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. It shows that stress is concentrated on the connections of Gird, X and Grid-Octet lattices in directions parallel to the loading direction as the compressive loading is applied. In case of gyroid lattice structure, the surface and nodes are smooth, when the loading is applied to the structure, the stress concentration phenomenon is less than other types of lattice structures. Thus, this material property enables the optimized design to cope with uncertain external loads without significant variations in stiffness.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Optimization process</head><p>In this section, we discuss how to use the elastic scaling law to obtain the minimum compliance cellular structure for a mechanical component. As the effective mechanical properties can be represented through the scaling law as a function of the relative density of a given cellular structure, the relative density is treated as a design variable in our optimization process. Standard topology optimization methods such as SIMP and BESO provide an optimum solution for placing available material within a given design space to obtain best structural performance. The elements are considered as isotropic materials. It is reasonable to use the element density calculated directly by structure optimization as the basis for lattice filling, because almost all types of lattice structures are anisotropic.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ρ ij 0 1 Property P(X) Graded Structure Y ρ ijk V ijk t ijk (a) (b) (c) f map</formula><p>Therefore, the lattice infill optimization problem can be treated as optimize density distribution of a mechanical part.</p><p>In this paper, a modified density-based topology optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the infilling process by considering the materials properties of cellular structures. The objective function used here is to identify the optimal distribution of material density, subjected to target volume constraint, to minimize structural compliance. Hence, the mathematic expression of the minimum compliance problem for the cellular structure takes the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">        1 min max 1 min 2 .. 01 T rr r G G r n ir i r c st Vv                   u K u f K u CC (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>Where structural compliance c(ρ r ) is the objective function, K is the global stiffness matrix, f is the external load vector, u is the displacement vector. The first constraint is the equilibrium equation. The second constraint is the elastic scaling law as discussed in Section 4. The third constraint limits the total design volume to V * . The final constraint requires that the relative density is bounded by the minimum and maximum relative densities. Compared with the standard minimum compliance problem, the second constraint is a fictitious elastic scaling law used to drive the design variable to be void or solid during the optimization process, os it has no real physical meaning. In contrast, in the proposed approach for cellular structure design, the second constraint uses the elastic scaling law that represents the real mechanical properties of the underlying cellular structure as a function of its relative density.</p><p>Hence, the intermediate densities can be achieved by the corresponding densities of cellular structures.</p><p>Besides, for the case where the external shape does not need to be retained, we can optimize the spatial lattice structure according to the printing direction further. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8a</ref> illustrates a given design space with boundary conditions, load, and the direction for 3D printing. According to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">13</ref>), we perform an initial optimization process.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">MBB experiment</head><p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the classic MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm) beam design problem is solved. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9a</ref> shows that the dimensions of the beam model are 120mm×20mm×20mm. In the model, a vertical displacement is applied onto the middle of the upper face of the beam. Displacements are fixed at the supports located at the left and right bottom face as indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9a</ref>. Since the MBB structure is symmetrical, only the right side is selected for analysis and illustration in this paper. The finite element mesh of the half MBB beam consists of 24,000 8-noded hexahedron elements with an average element size of 1.0mm. The values used for the various materials parameters are as follows: E=2,100MPa for Young's modulus, ν=0.3 for Poisson's ratio, which are the properties of the material that we are going used for 3D printing. The scaling law of the gyroid lattice structure used for optimization is given in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">13</ref>), and the target volume fraction is set to 0.3. In addition, the minimum and maximum relative densities are set as ρ min =0.1 and ρ max =0.8. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9b~e</ref> shows the optimized results of different optimization strategies. We can see that the standard topology optimized results need much more support structures for AM (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9c</ref>).  For the three-point bending experiment, a full-scale uniform gyroid lattice and an optimized beam from our shape-retained FGCS optimization method are printed with a Form-2 3D Printer (formlabs Inc). The experiment on the 3D printed beams are conducted on a three-point bending setting on a loading frame, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">12a</ref>. The beams are loaded at a rate of 0.25 mm/s until failure. The data acquisition system records the displacements and the corresponding loads. Then, we compare the experimental results between the uniform gyroid lattice and the beam from shape-retained FGCS method, which the load-displacement curves are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">12b</ref>. Note that the optimized beam is much stiffer than the uniform beam as it should be because the former is optimized for minimum compliance. Besides, the strength of the optimized beam is also 161.9 percent higher than the uniform lattice beam.</p><p>These results show the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method for designing functionally graded lattice structures. Inspired by the discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, the structural robustness of the ability to withstand forces variations is discussed in this section. The advantage of the cellular structure is the ability to withstand forces from indefinite directions. Some parts are vulnerable to collisions originating from unknown directions in the actual working environment, such as quadrotors. To demonstrate this, a case of rectangular block design area is given in this section, and the boundary conditions are as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">13a</ref>. The material properties are set as: E=2,100MPa, ν=0.30. As well as the target volume fraction is set to 0.3. The minimum and maximum densities are set as ρ min =0.1, ρ max =0.8. Then, we conduct the proposed infill optimization method to generate a functionally graded cellular structure of the design area. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">13a</ref> shows the results of three types of optimization strategies: (a) standard topology optimization method, (b) our shape-retained FGCS optimization method, and (c) uniform gyroid cellular infill method.</p><p>To examine the effectiveness of displacement for different loading directions, we then rotate the force directions start from an initial position, and 15 degrees per rotation. Then, we reanalyze the displacement of the object under the new force direction. The displacement values in the direction of the force changes are expressed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">13b</ref>. At the initial angle of zero degrees, displacements of the three methods are close, and the standard topology optimization and our FGCS method are better than the uniform gyroid at all angles. At angles up to about 20°, the stiffness of the standard topology optimization is higher than other methods. Then, beyond 20° our proposed method becomes better than standard topology optimization method. The above results suggest that the proposed method is able to withstand the occurrence of uncertain loads. For example, the aircraft is prone to some collision in an uncertain direction. with respect to changing force directions of the models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Application: quadcopter arm optimization</head><p>To further illustrate the proposed design optimization method, a design case of the quadcopter arm is given in this section. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">14a</ref>, the arm can be simplified as a cantilever beam model with a fixed boundary condition on the left-hand side and an upward lifting force on the right-hand side from the rotating motor. The primary function of the arm is to transfer the lifting force from the propeller to the frame of the quadcopter. There are four design requirements which are summarized based on general design and fabrication guidelines of the quadcopter <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, which are listed below.</p><p>(1) The maximum displacement at point B should be smaller than 7mm under the given load condition.</p><p>(2) The maximum stress should be smaller than the yield stress of selected materials.</p><p>(3) The total weight of the part should be small or equal to 33 g.</p><p>(4) The main body of the frame should be porous to minimize the drag force when the air passes through it vertically.</p><p>The quadrotor cantilever is most commonly designed as a truss structure. In this work, we will compare it with our proposed method by the finite element analysis simulation and the experiments on 3D printed prototypes. In our experiment, we select ABS (Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) as the material for the simulation, optimization, and 3D printing. The material properties are as follows: E=2,070MPa for Young's modulus, ν=0.35 for Poisson's ratio, yield stress 38Mpa. In addition, the target volume fraction is set to 0.2, and the minimum and maximum densities are set as ρ min =0.1, ρ max =0.8. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">14b~d</ref> show the results of three types of optimization strategies: standard topology optimization, traditional truss design method and our FGCS based optimization method. According to the given boundary conditions and loading conditions, the FEA simulation and topology optimization are carried out. Shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">15a</ref> and c are the displacement contours of the truss design method and our FGCS based optimization method. It is found that the displacement of the optimized quadcopter arm is 44.7 percent less than that of the traditional truss design for the same boundary and loading conditions. To further verify this conclusion, physical tests on both truss design method and our FGCS optimization method have been carried.  </p></div>
