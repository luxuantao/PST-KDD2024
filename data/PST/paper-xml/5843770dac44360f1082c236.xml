<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The rising popularity of wireless services resulting in spectrum shortage has motivated dynamic spectrum sharing to facilitate efficient usage of the underutilized spectrum. Wideband spectrum sensing is a critical functionality to enable dynamic spectrum access by enhancing the opportunities of exploring spectral holes, but entails a major implementation challenge in compact commodity radios that only have limited energy and computation capabilities. In contrast to traditional sub-Nyquist approaches where a wideband signal or its power spectrum is first reconstructed from compressed samples, this paper proposes a sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing scheme that locates occupied channels blindly by recovering the signal support, based on the jointly sparse nature of multiband signals. Exploiting the common signal support shared among multiple secondary users (SUs), an efficient cooperative spectrum sensing scheme is developed, in which the energy consumption on wideband signal acquisition, processing, and transmission is reduced with detection performance guarantee. Based on subspace decomposition, the low-dimensional measurement matrix, computed at each SU from local sub-Nyquist samples, is deployed to reduce the transmission and computation overhead while improving noise robustness. The theoretical analysis of the proposed sub-Nyquist wideband sensing algorithm is derived and verified by numerical analysis and further tested on real-world TV white space signals. It shows that the proposed scheme can achieve good detection performance as well as reduce computation and implementation complexity, in comparison with conventional cooperative wideband spectrum sensing schemes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>has become a major bottleneck for wireless industry. The threat of spectrum shortage has encouraged the governments to take critical steps towards releasing multiple bands for dynamic spectrum sharing, motivated by the fact that the actual spectrum is underutilized in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. For instance, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, collected by the RFeye node <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> located at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in London, United Kingdom, shows that a large portion of the spectrum remains unused. In particular, TV white space (TVWS) is one of the most promising section for dynamic spectrum sharing, which is composed of the channels that are not used by digital terrestrial televisions (DTT) or programme making and special events (PMSE) users, and those freed up by the switch-over from analogue to digital TV broadcasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The UK communications regulator, Ofcom of Communications (Ofcom), has announced the licence exempt regulations for TVWS in December 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Compact and low-power white space devices for rural broadband/WiFi-like accesses and Machineto-Machine (M2M) communications could therefore operate on these vacant channels without causing interferences to the primary transmissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>To enable dynamic spectrum access over TVWS, one needs fast and accurate detection of the surrounding spectrum that does not cause interferences to primary transmissions. One major current approach to discover available TVWS channels is using a Geo-location database <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, this approach requires an initial wired or wireless link available at the master white space device in order to report its location to the central database <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Moreover, rapid dynamic changes of the wireless environment pose significant challenges to this database-only approach. Dynamic spectrum sensing and its combination with database approaches could address these challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Spectrum sensing is a critical functionality to enable the implementation of dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Its goal is to allow secondary users (SUs) to identify the spectrum occupancy states before opportunistically exploiting the temporarily vacant frequency channels, while protecting primary users (PUs) from harmful interferences caused by secondary transmissions. To achieve spectrum awareness over a wide frequency range, wideband spectrum sensing is a highly desirable feature in cognitive radio networks. If a PU reappears over a certain band, the availability of several other possible vacant channels facilitates the seamless handoff from one spectrum channel to another, which reduces secondary data transmission interruptions. However, for wideband spectrum sensing, a stringent requirement arises from the Nyquist signal acquisition, which is quite expensive, power-consuming and computation intensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Due to the energy constraint in compact SUs, efficient real-time wideband spectrum sensing emerges as a crucial challenge for dynamic spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks.</p><p>A simple approach for wideband spectrum sensing is to use a tunable narrowband bandpass filter at the radio-frequency (RF) front-end to scan through all of the narrow channels one by one to detect the existence or non-existence of licensed primary transmissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, the sequential nature of such schemes could introduce a long sensing period and thus requires additional energy supply at the SUs. Such delay in the sensing process will also cause missed opportunities or interferences to PUs. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a filter bank algorithm is proposed to process the wideband signal by multiple narrowband bandpass filters with different shifted central frequencies. However, it requires a great number of RF front-end components, e.g., bandpass filters, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), etc., which may be a serious issue at SUs with restricted energy resources.</p><p>Landau in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> demonstrated that an arbitrary wideband signal can be perfectly reconstructed if being sampled at a rate no less than the total bandwidth of occupied spectrum. As wireless signals over an open spectrum are typically sparse in the frequency domain, it can be recovered by sampling at a rate far less than the Nyquist rate in practice. Compressive sensing were thus introduced to implement wideband spectrum sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Although the energy consumption at the wideband signal sampling part is reduced, compressive sensing requires random sub-Nyquist projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Therefore, custom AD-Cs with complex hardware that can perform analog mixing or analog matrix multiplication at high frequency are needed in compressive wideband spectrum sensing schemes, which do not work well with low-power commodity hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Moreover, estimating a wideband spectrum from its compressed samples is usually achieved by solving an optimization problem, which requires high computation complexity and thus is hard to implement in compact commodity radios with limited computational capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a wideband spectrum sensing scheme based on multicoset sampling was proposed, which is a nonuniform sub-Nyquist sampling technique and can be realized using an efficient multi-channel architecture. In addition, a low-speed sub-Nyquist multicoset sampling strategy was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for wideband spectrum sensing without the need of analog frontend processing. However, it requires the knowledge of the spectral support to allow for the perfect reconstruction at the minimal sampling rate provided by the Landau's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. To estimate the locations of the occupied channels, Feng and Bresler showed its similarity to the direction of arrival estimation in the traditional sensor array processing, and proposed to use the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm for signal detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, the detection accuracy based on MUSIC algorithm degrades severely when the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) decreases.</p><p>To overcome the SNR degeneration due to multipath fading, shadowing, and noise uncertainty over wireless channels, cooperative spectrum sensing was proposed to improve sensing reliability by exploiting the spatial diversity across multiple SUs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, where as PUs typically transmit at much higher power levels, a common sparse spectrum support is usually perceived by all the surrounding SUs. To minimize the communication overhead for collaboration, distributed orthogonal matching pursuit (DOMP) was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, where each SU estimates the common signal support independently based on its local compressed samples via orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and then the estimated supports are fused through a majority voting rule to get the final decision. Although the scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> is efficient to reduce the transmission overhead, it suffers from the disadvantage of requiring a local detector at each SU and losing certain information due to the nonoptimal decision fusion. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Tian proposed a distributed cooperative sensing algorithm based on compressive sensing, in which sampling statistics rather than sensing decisions are exchanged to reach a reliable global fusion. However, it increases the transmission cost and the local l 1 optimization introduces a high computation complexity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, each SU implements wideband channel division to sense K out of L channels and then matrix completion is performed at a fusion center to reconstruct the original spectrum for decision making. As SUs do not sense the whole spectrum, spatial diversity among SUs is not fully exploited and a threshold needs to be predefined to obtain the final decision.</p><p>Motivated by the above challenges, this paper first proposes a reliable individual (working at each individual SU node) sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing scheme that can locate active channels blindly, without knowing a priori spectral support of the signal before sampling and processing. The only prior information required is an upper bound κ on the possible number of active channels, the maximum bandwidth f max , and the bandwidth of each channel B. Thus there are up to κ out of L = f max /B channels occupied. Following the individual wideband spectrum sensing scheme, an efficient cooperative scheme is then proposed to reduce energy consumption on signal acquisition, processing, and transmission, with certain detection performance guarantee. The major contributions of the proposed scheme are summarized as follows:</p><p>• As compact SUs have limited energy and computational capabilities, no signal reconstruction is performed at the SUs to reduce the computation load. Each SU simply implements a multicoset sampler to subsample the wideband signal in the goal of reducing energy consumed on signal sampling. Then a low-dimensional measurement matrix is computed based on subspace decomposition to estimate the active channel locations by recovering the joint signal support of the multiband signal. Compared with the original sub-Nyquist samples, the constructed measurement matrix improves the computation efficiency.</p><p>As noise distortion is reduced in the constructed measurement matrix, the detection performance is improved in the low SNR regime in comparison with the one solved by the traditional MUSIC algorithm. • By exploiting the common signal support perceived at all SUs, simultaneous-orthogonal matching pursuit (SOM-P) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> is extended to recover the signal support by jointly fusing measurements shared among the SUs. The index that accounts for the largest residual norm among all SUs is selected in each iteration to achieve accurate detection performance. Different sampling patterns are assigned to different SUs for measurement diversity, with cooperation among SUs reducing the required number of cosets close to the active channel number, where reliable cooperative spectrum sensing is achieved at the minimal sampling rate specified by the Landau's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, signal and network models are described. Section III describes the proposed individual sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing scheme. Section IV develops the centralized cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. Section V analyzes and validates the proposed individual and cooperative schemes, over both simulated and real-world TVWS signals. Conclusions are drawn in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SIGNAL AND NETWORK MODELS</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we investigate both the individual (J = 1) and cooperative (J &gt; 1) wideband spectrum sensing in a cognitive radio network with a fusion center and J SUs, which share the same spectrum with a PU network. To reduce the energy consumption in high frequency signal processing, compressive multicoset sampling is applied to reduce the signal sampling and acquisition costs by exploiting the sparsity in the wireless wideband signal given the low spectrum utilization. With no prior information assumed on the band locations, blind sub-Nyquist sampling and reliable support recovery are implemented at each individual SU to estimate the active channel locations. To further improve the detection performance in low SNR regimes, a centralized cooperative spectrum sensing scheme will be later developed, in which soft fusion is adopted, i.e., SUs send their sampling statistics to the fusion center, where a high-resolution global sensing decision is made. However, traditional soft fusion rules suffer from the disadvantage of large transmission overheads and high computation complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Thus, this paper further aims to reduce the transmission and computation overhead by adopting a new fusion rule, without degrading the detection accuracy with cooperative spectrum sensing.  </p></div>

PROPOSED INDIVIDUAL SUB-NYQUIST WIDEBAND</head><p>SPECTRUM SENSING In this section, we first consider a non-cooperative blind sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing at each individual SU based on multicoset sampling, i.e., J = 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Blind Sub-Nyquist Wideband Signal Acquisition</head><p>Given the prior information on the number of narrowband channels L, multicoset sampling is first executed at each SU by taking non-uniform samples at the time instants t = (mL + c i )T , where i = 1, ..., p, m ∈ Z, and 1/T = f s is the Nyquist sampling rate. The set C = {c i } p i=1 , which comprises of p distinct integers chosen from {0, 1, ..., L -1}, is referred as a (L, p) sampling pattern.

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, efficient fabrications of time-interleaved ADC implemented as a single integrated circuit are proposed. As multicoset sampler only needs fewer channels than the time-interleaved ADC (p ≤ L), the hardware implementation would be simpler and less power-consuming.

Reliable Computation Efficient Joint Sparse Recovery</head><p>With multicoset samplers, each SU gets p sample sequences in a matrix from Y(f ) ∈ C p×N , where N is the number of samples in each coset.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PROPOSED COOPERATIVE WIDEBAND SPECTRUM SENSING</head><p>As sub-Nyquist measurements are quite vulnerable to channel degradations, cooperation among multiple SUs is necessary in sub-Nyquist wideband sensing. Assume that there are J coexisting SUs within the local region that cooperatively sense the wideband to locate the active channel set S. The received signals at the SUs are from the same primary transmissions but affected differently by fading and shadowing from the common PU transmitter to each SU. Thus all SUs share a common sparse support with different amplitudes.</p><p>The proposed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme can be formulated into a three-step framework:</p><p>1) Each SU implements a multicoset sampler that independently samples the signal with a different sampling pattern C (j) from the others, e.g., randomly chosen to allow for more sampling diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Measurement matrix χ (j)</head><p>s is constructed at each SU from its sub-Nyquist samples based on subspace decomposition. Then the local matrix χ (j) s with the sampling pattern C (j) is transmitted to the fusion center.</p><p>3) The fusion center locates the active channels by jointly fusing measurements shared among the SUs to reach a global sensing decision with enhanced accuracy. Based on the measurement matrix (j) s and the sampling pattern C (j) sent from each SU, the fusion center computes the corresponding reconstruction matrix A (j) and then locates the active channels by exploiting the common signal support shared by ν (j) s , j = 1, • • • , J, across all SUs. At each SU, the following relationship holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">χ (j) s = A (j) ν (j) s , 1 ≤ j ≤ J.<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Exploiting the common sparse support shared by the J SUs, the fusion center fuses measurements sent from all SUs to locate the original active channels. Grouping the rows of ν (j) s , j = 1, ..., J, with the same indices, forms the matrix ζ s as T , l = 1, ..., L, and the block size is equal to the number of SUs J. As there are at most κ channels occupied, ζ s can be modeled as a block κ-sparse matrix. Thus, in each iteration, the block index that accounts for the largest residual norm among all SUs is selected, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">ζ s = ν (1) s [1] T • • • ν (J) s [1] T νs[1] T • • • ν (1) s [L] T • • • ν (J) s [L] T νs[L] T T ,<label>(20) where ν</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">l t = arg max l J j=1 a (j)H l R (j) t-1 2 , l ∈ 1, ..., L,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where R</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(j)</head><p>t-1 is the residue at the (t -1)-th iteration at the j-th SU, a (j) l is the l-th column in A (j) , and l t is the selected index. The detailed algorithm for the proposed joint support recovery at the fusion center is described in Algorithm 2, where each SU implements EFT to estimate the signal sparsity κ(j) , and then the fusion center takes the average κ, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">κ = 1 J J j=1 κ(j) ,<label>(22)</label></formula><p>for the number of iterations at the joint support recovery in Algorithm 2.</p><p>Based on the measurements shared among the SUs, the detection performance is improved in low SNR regimes. Moreover, thanks to the measurement diversity across multiple SUs given the different sampling patterns, the fusion center could obtain an accurate estimate of occupied channel locations at the sampling rate approaching the Landau's rate as the number of SUs increases, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">17</ref>. This is due to the fact that the sub-coherence within the block,</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">µ = max 1≤l≤L ( max 1≤i =j≤J ||a (i)H l a (j) l ||),<label>(23)</label></formula><p>is substantially smaller than the conventional coherence in the equivalent reconstruction matrix A <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Reconstruction of the block sparse signal in the cooperative sensing scheme therefore can be guaranteed with an eased requirement comparing to the reconstruction in the individual scheme. Therefore, a small number of cosets p proportional to the signal sparsity κ is sufficient for cooperative spectrum sensing. The computation complexity of support recovery at the fusion center could be expressed as O(κ 3 LJ).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Individual sub-Nyquist Wideband Spectrum Sensing</head><p>To reduce the computation complexity with good noise robustness, subspace decomposition is applied at each SU to derive the measurement matrix χ s based on the local sub-Nyquist samples. In this section, the detection performance of the proposed scheme based on SA-SOMP is compared with the one with the MUSIC algorithm, which was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for sparse support recovery with multicoset sampling. The impact of system parameters, such as the SNR, the sub-Nyquist sampling ratio, and the channel occupancy ratio, are also investigated.</p><p>1) Spectrum Sensing Performance versus SNR: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> shows the detection probability P d with respect to received SNR ranging from -5 dB to 20 dB. The channel occupancy ratio Ω is assumed to be 10%, such that 4 out of 40 channels are randomly chosen to be occupied. Multicoset samplers with p = 10, 15, 20 are used to sample the received signal, corresponding to the sub-Nyquist sampling ratios of α = p/L = 25%, 37.5%, 50%. The p integers of each sampling pattern C are selected randomly out of L. It is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> that the performance of the proposed SA-SOMP scheme is superior to that with the MUSIC algorithm, and improves monotonically as SNR increases.</p><p>2) Spectrum Sensing Performance versus sub-Nyquist Sampling Ratio: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref> depicts the reconstructed signal in time and frequency with p = 15. Thus the sub-Nyquist sampling ratio is α = p/L = 37.5%. Compared with original signal shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, the reconstruction MSE is computed to be 2.7%.</p><p>To show the relationship between the detection performance and the sub-Nyquist sampling ratio α, we plot P d against p in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref>. The channel occupancy ratio Ω still assumed to be  10% (κ = 4). When the number of cosets p is greater than the number of occupied channels κ only by one, i.e., α = 12.5%, it yields a poor support recovery at individual SUs, thus resulting in a low detection probability. As the number of cosets increases to p ≥ 2κ, better detection performance is achieved, increasing P d close to 1 under SNR = 5 dB when p = 10 for the proposed scheme and outperforming that with the MUSIC algorithm. At SNR = -5 dB, a high detection probability (P d ≥ 0.9) is achieved when p increases above 20 (α = 50%) in the proposed scheme, while MUSIC needs more cosets at p = 30 (α = 75%).</p><p>3) Spectrum Sensing Performance versus Spectrum Occupancy Ratio: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">14</ref> shows the detection performance of the proposed spectrum sensing scheme with different numbers of active channels κ. A multicoset sampler with p = 20 is used, such that the sub-Nyquist sampling ratio is α = 50%. The number of active channels κ varies from 4, 8 to 12 and their positions are randomly selected out of L = 40 channels. As Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">14</ref> shows, the detection performance degrades as the number of active channels increases, which indicates that more samples should be collected for signal reconstruction to ensure that the detection performance is not degraded as the channel occupancy ratio Ω increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Cooperative sub-Nyquist Wideband Spectrum Sensing</head><p>In this section, the performance of the proposed cooperative wideband spectrum sensing scheme is compared with several other cooperative schemes in terms of transmission and computation complexity and detection accuracy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Performance Comparison against SOMP and DOMP:</head><p>To analyze the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of transmission overhead and local/fusion computation complexity, we compare the proposed algorithm with two extreme cases: performing OMP at each SU independently and then fusing the estimated supports via majority rule (termed DOMP), and transmitting the original sub-Nyquist samples and then jointly recovering signal support based on SOMP (termed SOMP), as shown in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">15</ref> presents the detection performance of the three schemes. Although DOMP has the minimum transmission overhead, its detection performance is the worst. Compared with SOMP, the proposed scheme achieves good detection performance with lower transmission overhead and computation complexity, due to the subspace decomposition.</p><p>2) Spectrum Sensing Performance versus Number of SUs and Sub-Nyquist Sampling Ratio: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">16</ref> shows the global detection probability P d of the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme with different numbers of SUs. It is observed that the detection performance is improved as the number of cooperative SUs increases. This is because as more SUs joints, measurements shared among SUs make the wideband sensing more accurate. By incorporating the observations from multiple SUs, it is possible to achieve the desired detection performance even at low SNR levels. For the desired detection performance, e.g., P d ≥ 0.9, individual spectrum sensing (J = 1) requires SNR = 2 dB under sub-Nyquist sampling ratio α = 25% (p = 10), while the collaboration of 10 SUs can achieve it at SNR = -4 dB.</p><p>For the same wideband signal, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">17</ref> shows the global detection performance when the number of cosets at each SU reduces to p = 5. As p is greater than the number of occupied channels κ only by one, individual sensing (J = 1) yields poor detection performance even in the high SNR region. Based on measurements fusion among multiple SUs, cooperative spectrum sensing can improve the detection performance as the number of joint SUs J increases. As the value of SNR increases, SU cooperation could achieve highly reliable detection at the minimal sampling rate provided by the Landau's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, such that a lower number of cosets p is required at each SU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Real-world TVWS Signal Analysis</head><p>After the robust performance of the proposed sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing schemes have been validated with simulated signals under individual and cooperative sensing setups, it is further tested over real-world TVWS signals collected by the RFeye sensing node installed in our lab as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>.</p><p>To obtain the channel occupancy information over the realworld TVWS signals, a multicoset sampler is firstly applied to subsample the time domain signal, and then the signal support is recovered to estimate the active channel set. Compared with conventional energy detection, which needs to compute the received signal power at each channel and then compare the power against the predefined threshold from the historical statistics to distinguish between the channel occupied by PU signals and a spectrum hole, the proposed wideband spectrum sensing scheme does not require knowledge of the spectrum information either at the sampling stage or at reconstruction stage; thus the computation and implementation complexity is reduced. In addition, the blind signal support estimation directly obtains the positions of the active channels. Once the  signal support is recovered, reconstruction of the wideband signal has a closed-form solution, as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">18</ref> shows the reconstructed real-world TVWS spectrum at an individual SU equipped with a multicoset sampler, for p = 10 and 15, respectively. It is observed that a smaller MSE of the reconstructed signal is achieved under a higher p, but at the cost of a higher sampling rate thus more sample processing. When p = 10, i.e., κ &lt; p &lt; 2κ, the individual wideband spectrum sensing scheme misses some occupied channels such that the detection probability P d reduces to 0.625 and the reconstruction MSE gets higher as well.</p><p>We then consider the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme with p = 10 and J = 3. Due to the measurements sharing among SUs, the fusion center gets an accurate signal support estimation such that the detection probability P d increases to 1 and the reconstructed signal achieves a good approximation to the original signal, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">20</ref> illustrates the detection probability P d against the sub-Nyquist sampling ratio α over the real-world TVWS signal. Similarly as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">17</ref>, the detection performance is improved as the number of SUs J increases. We see that a smaller number of cosets p proportional to the number of occupied channels κ suffices for the reliable detection in the cooperative cognitive radio networks. VI. CONCLUSION Wideband spectrum sensing is of critical importance to enable dynamic spectrum sharing. In this paper, efficient multicoset sampling based wideband spectrum sensing schemes have been proposed for both individual and cooperative sensing cases to reduce energy consumption on wideband signal acquisition, processing, and transmission, with detection performance guarantee by exploiting the joint sparsity of the multiband signals. Based on a low-rate multi-channel architecture, sub-Nyquist sampling is implemented without complex analog front-end processing. The proposed wideband spectrum sensing schemes locate the active channels blindly without the prior knowledge of the spectral support for the received signal at either the sub-Nyquist sampling or reconstruction stage.</p><p>Compared with individual wideband spectrum sensing scheme based on MUSIC, the proposed scheme improves the detection accuracy in low SNR regimes. Exploiting the common signal support perceived at all SUs, the detection accuracy is further improved through cooperative spectrum sensing, in which measurements from multiple SUs are fused jointly to reach a final sensing decision. Based on lowdimensional measurements derived by subspace decomposition, the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme gains better noise robustness while reduces both computation complexity and transmission overhead. Moreover, thanks to the measurement diversity across multiple SUs, reliable sensing results can be achieved at the minimal sampling rate specified by the Landau's theorem, such that the number of cosets p proportional to the signal sparsity κ is shown sufficient for reliable cooperative spectrum sensing.</p><p>The robust performance of the proposed wideband spectrum sensing scheme has also been validated over real-world TVWS signals recorded by the RFeye node at QMUL. In comparison with conventional sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing schemes, numerical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve good detection performance as well as reduced computation and implementation complexity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FrequencyFig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
