<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Identification of drug-target interactions is an important process in drug discovery. Although high-throughput screening and other biological assays are becoming available, experimental methods for drug-target interaction identification remain to be extremely costly, time-consuming and challenging even nowadays. Therefore, various computational models have been developed to predict potential drug-target associations on a large scale. In this review, databases and web servers involved in drug-target identification and drug discovery are summarized. In addition, we mainly introduced some stateof-the-art computational models for drug-target interactions prediction, including network-based method, machine learning-based method and so on. Specially, for the machine learning-based method, much attention was paid to supervised and semi-supervised models, which have essential difference in the adoption of negative samples. Although significant improvements for drug-target interaction prediction have been obtained by many effective computational models, both network-based and machine learning-based methods have their disadvantages, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss the future directions of the network-based drug discovery and network approach for personalized drug discovery based on personalized medicine, genome sequencing, tumor clone-based network and cancer hallmark-based network. Finally, we discussed the new evaluation validation framework and the formulation of drug-target interactions prediction problem by more realistic regression formulation based on quantitative bioactivity data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>been approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as NMEs each year <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In recent years, the rate of successful drug development has decreased. In this light, new uses for existing or abandoned drugs are urgent <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Such a new strategy is called drug repositioning or drug repurposing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Traditional drug discovery primarily followed the 'one molecule-one target-one disease' paradigm, which aimed to seek the most specific drugs to act on individual targets for individual diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In this approach, a specific protein is studied in vitro, in cells and in whole organisms, and evaluated as a drug target for a specific therapeutic indication. This historical paradigm has resulted in the identification of some effective chemical molecules that affect specific proteins. However, the major limiting factor of this traditional drug discovery paradigm is that pharmaceuticals are designed to target individual factors in a disease system, but complex diseases are multifactorial in nature and vulnerable at multiple attacks. The disease symptom is a progression accumulation of mutations and interventions of different genes and pathways. Multiple stages along the disease pathway may need to be manipulated simultaneously for an effective treatment of the diseases. Because this traditional paradigm ignores the complex interactions between drugs and their target proteins and the important fact that many complex diseases tend to be associated with multiple target proteins, this paradigm has not accelerated the new drug discovery rate as expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Recently, there is an increasingly accepted concept 'polypharmacology', i.e. drugs often work by targeting not a single target protein, but multiple ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. In addition, multiple targets are often involved in the same disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Therefore, to increase the drug efficacy and overcome drug resistance and toxicity, much attention has been paid to multiple-target drug development and drug combination research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Because of the 'polypharmacological' property of a drug, 'offtarget' is an unintended occurring activity for a drug. On one hand, the off-target activities might result in some undesired side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. On the other hand, they can also occasionally be beneficial for some new or unexpected therapeutic effects for old drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Such polypharmacological features could help us find new uses of drugs, namely drug repositioning, which has been mentioned above <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Nowadays, a critical phase to accelerate the progression of drug discovery is to confirm whether a drug could interact with a target <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Drug discovery requires the accurate identification of the complex interactions between drugs and a wide variety of protein targets. All of these highlight the critical role of the identification of drug-target interactions in drug discovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug-target interactions</head><p>The majority of drug targets are cellular proteins, which aim to treat or diagnose a disease by selectively interacting with chemical compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Current studies have shown that classical therapeutic drug targets contain $130 protein families <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, such as enzymes, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels and transporters, nuclear hormone receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Many efforts have been made to estimate the total number of drug targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. There are estimated about 6000-8000 targets in the human genome that have pharmacological interest, but only a small part of these targets have been involved in approved drugs so far <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. A large number of putative drug targets remains to be validated.</p><p>From the view point of drug, although it is estimated that PubChem database contains 35 million compounds, only &lt;7000 compounds have the information of their corresponding target proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Furthermore, it is estimated that the set of all possible small molecules has already consisted of &gt;10 60 compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Among these drugs with corresponding target proteins, most of them are small chemical compounds, which interact with an appropriate target protein involved in a disease of interest and inhibit or activate the biological behavior of the target proteins. Besides the selective targets, drugs may also interact with additional proteins, which are not their primary therapeutic targets, i.e. off-target effects.</p><p>Correct identification and validation of drug-target interactions is the first step on drug discovery pipeline. Until now, there are many potential drug-target interactions that have not been discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The identification of novel drugs and their targets is still an extremely difficult goal owing to the relatively limited knowledge about the complex relationship between chemical space and genomic space <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. There are many factors that affect the establishment of the interactions between a drug and its targets, such as various chemical bonds that are related to the affinity of the drug for its targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, a number of factors make the identification of drug-target interactions more urgent than ever before. Firstly, although over the past decade, a growing number of compounds were synthesized, their drug effects and target proteins are still unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Secondly, there are still a variety of diseases that cannot be cured and many new diseases emerge every year <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Finally, largescale data sets on various properties of compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, features of target proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and responses in the human physiological system <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> have been collected by researchers. However, these high-dimensional data sets present great challenges to researchers owing to their high dimensionality, complex structure and distinct types <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Considering the existence of multiple drugs and various target proteins and complicated associations between them, experimental verification of drug-target associations remains to be time-consuming and expensive and limited to small-scale research even nowadays <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Therefore, there is urgent need for appropriate and powerful computational prediction methods that could detect the complex drug-target associations effectively on a large scale. Computational drug-target interaction identification could benefit both better understanding of complex biological interactions and important biological processes and the acceleration of novel drug discovery and human medical improvement. Especially, predicting potential drug-target interactions from heterogeneous biological data has been the hot topic of computational biology, which could provide new potential drug-target interaction candidates for biological experimental validation and decrease the time and cost of biological experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational models</head><p>Nowadays, although high-throughput screening and other biological assays are becoming available, experimental methods for drug-target interaction prediction remain extremely challenging and time-consuming <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. Therefore, it is important to develop new effective non-experimental method to infer drug-target associations. Molecular docking has been widely applied to virtually screen the compounds against target proteins when 3D structure of compounds are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. However, the 3D structures of the majority of drugs are difficult to be obtained; thus, this important limitation has limited the wide use of molecular docking on a large scale. Nowadays, a number of computational models have been developed to address the drug-target prediction problem. In this review, these models have been divided into three main categories, including network-based model, machine learning-based model and other models.</p></div>

The aim of MTOI is to find multiple target optimal intervention (MTOI) solutions that give the best disease state transformation. Therefore, the output of MTOI includes not only plenty of potential drug-target interactions, but also optimal combinatorial intervention solutions. The method was applied to an inflammationrelated network-the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic network (AAnetwork) for the identification of optimal multi-target antiinflammatory intervention solutions. Particularly in stage 2, Monte Carlo-simulated annealing was performed to find the desired state, and the objective function was defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C T;net C T;disease LTB4 ? 0:1 ? C T;net C T;disease PGE2 ? 0:1 ? CT;PGI2 CT;TXA2 net CT;PGI2 CT;TXA2 disease ? 1</formula><p>where C T;net and C T;disease were the 1 h cumulative production of the metabolite in the present network and disease states, respectively.</p><p>Drug side-effect similarity-based method Campillos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> proposed a method by using drug side-effect similarity to identify whether two drugs interact with the same target. In this article, the author proposed a sigmoid function (P 2D ) that modeled the probability of sharing the same target based on chemical similarity information (2D Tanimoto coefficient) and a linear function (P SE ) that modeled the probability of sharing the same target depending on the side-effect similarity measure, respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P 2D y ? ? ? 1 ? e B ? y A 0 @ 1 A ?1 ?A ? 6:19; B ? 0:68? P SE x ? ? ? A ? x ? B</formula><p>?A ? ?0:084; B ? 0:047? P 2D and P SE are the probability of sharing the same target as a function of chemical similarity and side-effect similarity for all the drug pairs, respectively. A and B are parameters of the function. Therefore, a drug side-effect network has been constructed with 1018 drug side-effect relations and 746 marketed drugs. This method required the detailed information of drug side effects. Therefore, it can be only applied to marketed drugs that have package inserts to demonstrate their side effects. This important limitation has seriously limited its wide application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NRWRH</head><p>Based on the assumption that similar drugs often interact with similar target proteins and the integration of drug-drug similarity network, protein-protein similarity network and known drug-target interaction networks into a heterogeneous network, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> developed an effective model of Network-based Random Walk with Restart on the Heterogeneous network (NRWRH) to predict potential drug-target interactions by implementing random walk on the heterogeneous network (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>NRWRH makes full use of the network tool for data integration and drug-target interactions prediction, which is different from traditional random walk with restart. Here, random walk is implemented on the heterogeneous network, which consists of three different networks, i.e. drug-target interactions network, drug chemical structure similarity network and target protein sequence similarity network. There, even if the investigated drug has no known target, potential target of this given drug can still be predicted based on known targets of drugs, which are similar to this given drug. In NRWRH, the transition matrix on the heterogeneous network could be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M ? M TT M TD M DT M DD " #</formula><p>where M TT and M DD are intertransition matrix indicating the probability from one target (drug) to other target (drug) in the random walk, respectively; M TD is the transition matrix from target network to drug network, and M DT is the transition matrix from drug network to target network. These four transition matrices could be further defined based on drug similarity network, target similarity network and known drug-target interaction network. Finally, random walk could be implemented based on the following iteration equations, and the probability of finding the random walker at node i at step t can be decided.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p t?1 ? 1 ? r ? ?M T p t ? rp 0</formula><p>Here, the parameter r is the restart probability. NRWRH was applied to four classes of important drug-target interaction data sets (enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs and nuclear receptors), and significant performance improvement has been demonstrated in the terms of both cross validation and case studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DBSI, TBSI and NBI</head><p>Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> developed three supervised inference models to predict drug-target interactions, namely, drug-based similarity inference (DBSI), target-based similarity inference (TBSI) and network-based inference (NBI) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). For the DBSI, the score to predict the association between d i and t j is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v D ij ? X n l?1;l6 ?i S c d i ; d l ? ? a il X n l?1;l6 ?i S c d i ; d l ? ?</formula><p>where S c d i ; d l ? ?is 2D chemical similarity between drugs d i and d l calculated by SIMCOMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, and a ij ? 1 if drugs d i and target t j have been linked in known drug-target interaction network. For the TBSI, the score to predict the association between d i and t j is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v T ij ? X n l?1;l6 ?i S g t j ; t l ? ? a jl X n l?1;l6 ?i S g t j ; t l ? ?</formula><p>where S g t j ; t l ? ? is the genomic sequence similarity between targets t j and t l calculated based on normalized Smith-Waterman Score <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. For the NBI, the final resource (score) f(i) of drug d i after two-step diffusion is defined as follows: where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f i ? ? ? X m l?1 a il k t 1 ? ? X n o?1 a ol f 0 o ? ? k d o ? ?</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">f 0 o ? ? ? a oj; o 2 1; 2; . . . ; n f g , k d o ? ? ? X m s?1 a os and k t 1 ? ? ? X n</formula><p>s?1 a sl denote the initial resource of drug d 0 , the number of the targets that interact with d o and the number of the drugs that interact with t 1 , respectively. The difference among these three models lies in the similarity adaptation. DBSI and TBSI rely on chemical structural similarity and target sequence similarity, respectively, whereas NBI is only based on drug-target bipartite network topology similarity. Cross validation demonstrated that although NBI ignores drug chemical structure and target protein sequence information, it has shown the best performance among all of these three methods. However, NBI could not be applied to the new drugs without any known target information in the training set.</p><p>Within scores and between scores Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> presented an approach to predict drug-target interactions by characterizing each drug-target pairs as a feature vector composed of within scores and between scores. The within score C is the similarity between target t x and t i q. The formulas in drugs view are defined in the similar way as targets view. The advantage of this method is that it treated all types of drugtarget pairs in a same form and the relationship between known drug-target interactions, and unapproved drug-target pairs could be investigated in the same visualized space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Machine learning-based method</head><p>Nowadays, a number of machine learning-based methods have been developed to identify associations between drugs and target proteins on a large scale. In this review, we mainly introduce supervised learning method and semi-supervised learning method. In most of learning-based methods, different types of biological data sets have been integrated, such as drug chemical structures, target protein sequences and known drug-target interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supervised learning method</head><p>In the supervised learning method, drug-target pairs are labeled as positive or negative samples according to whether the known interaction between corresponding drug and target has been confirmed. However, the selection of negative samples is a common problem of all the supervised learning methods owing to the fact that we can not obtain drug-target pairs without interactions. Published experimental literatures only reports successful drug-target interactions obtained based on their biological experiments. Therefore, the unknown drug-target interactions have been regarded as negative samples in the supervised learning methods for drug-target interactions prediction. Inaccurate negative sample selection has largely influenced the predictive accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bipartite graph learning method</head><p>Yamanishi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposed a kernel regression-based method to infer drug-target interactions by integrating the chemical structure information of compounds, the sequence information of target proteins and the topology of known drug-target interactions network to investigate the four classes of drug-target interactions in human, including enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs and nuclear receptors (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). A supervised learning framework has been developed based on a bipartite graph, which mapped drugs and targets in chemical space and genomic space into a unified space called pharmacological space. In this study, two models (f c and f g ) could be learned based on a variant of the kernel regression model to demonstrate the correlation between the chemical space/genomic space and the pharmacological feature space, respectively. For the new compound c new and new proteing new , we can map them on the pharmacological feature space based on these two models.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">u cnew ? X nc i?1 s c c new ; c i ? ? w c i u gnew ? X ng j?1 s g g new ; g i ? ? w g j</formula><p>Where w c i and w g j are the weight vector, s c (?,?) and s g (?,?) indicate chemical structure similarity score and sequence similarity score. In this pharmacological space, known drug-target pairs that interact with each other are close, and drugs that have high structure similarity tend to interact with similar targets, and targets that have high sequence similarity tend to interact with similar drugs. Then, potential drug-target interactions are predicted by calculating the closeness between drugs and targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BLM</head><p>Bleakley and Yamanishi <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> developed a new supervised learning method, Bipartite Local Model (BLM), for the prediction of unknown drug-target interactions by transforming edge prediction problems into binary classification problems (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Firstly, target proteins of a given drug are predicted based on the sequence structure similarities between targets. Then, potential associated drugs of a given target protein are predicted based on the chemical similarity between drugs. Therefore, independent target-based and drug-based prediction results for each putative drug-target interaction are obtained, respectively. Finally, a definitive prediction for each interaction is obtained based on the average of these two independent predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bipartite graph learning method by introducing the pharmacological data</head><p>Under the assumption that pharmacological effect similarity is more correlated with drug-target interactions compared with chemical structure similarity, Yamanishi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> further proposed a correlation-based model to infer the relationships of unknown drug-target pairs based on chemical structure information, genomic sequence information and pharmacological effect information on a large scale (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). For any drug candidate compounds, the pharmacological effect similarity is predicted from chemical structures of given compounds. Then, the pharmacological effect similarity is introduced into the supervised bipartite graph inference model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to identify unknown drug-target interactions. The prediction score for new compound y and protein z is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">g y; z ? ?? X ny i?1</formula><p>X nz j?1 a ij S phar ?y i ; y?S geno ?z j ; z? where s phar (?,?) and s geno (?,?) are pharmacological similarity function for compounds and sequence similarity function for proteins, n y (n z ) is the number of compounds (proteins) and aij is the parameters learned from the model. The originality of this method is that it predicts potential pharmacological similarity for any drug candidate compounds and further integrates chemical, genomic and pharmacological information into a unified framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BLM-NII</head><p>Mei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> presented a new method named BLM-NII, which integrated Neighbor-based Interaction-profile Inferring (NII) and existing BLM model so that BLM model has been further extended to solve the limitation that it cannot predict the interactions for new drug or target candidates. In the NLL model, for a new drug d i , the j-th dimension of its interaction profile I d ?i? is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">I d j i ? ? ? X m d h?1 s ih a hj</formula><p>where s ih is the chemical similarity between drug d i and d h , m d is the number of drugs and A is the adjacency matrix of known drug-target interaction network  target t j has known interaction). Furthermore, linear scale is implemented by the following operation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(A i; j ? ? ? a ij ? 1 if drug d i and</formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">I d j i ? ? ? I d j i ? ? ? min h I d h i ? ? max h I d h i ? ? ? min h I d h i ? ?</formula><p>Then, the model such as support vector machine or regularized least squares could be used to learn a certain classifier. Therefore, the model of drug d i could be learned in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Mod 0 d i ? ? ? train?S t ; I d<label>?i??</label></formula><p>where S t is target similarity matrix, which indicates the observed data of targets, and I d ?i? is considered to be label information of each target to show whether the interaction exists between this target and investigated drug. Similarly, for the target t j , we also could obtain its interaction profile I t ?j? and could learn the model for this target as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Mod 0 t j ? ? ? train?S d ; I t<label>?j??</label></formula><p>where S d is drug similarity matrix, which indicates the observed data of drugs. Finally, the above NII strategy is integrated with BLM framework. BLM-NII model can make the predictions for new drug and target candidates and achieves good performance for inferring interactions between drugs and four classes of targets, especially for nuclear receptors. The most significant improvement has obtained when data set contains many drugs/ targets with no known interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RBM</head><p>Wang and Zeng <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed the first learning method to predict not only the binary interactions between drugs and targets but also different types of interactions (i.e. how they interact with each other) in the framework of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) based on a multidimensional drug-target network (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). This method cast the novel drug-target interaction problem into a two-layer RBM model (hidden unit layer and visible unit layer) and there are no intra-layer connections in these two layers. Furthermore, Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm is applied to train RBM model and make predictions. It has been demonstrated that multiple types of interactions integration could significantly improve the prediction accuracy of previous methods, which only used a single interaction type. One limitation of this method is that the prediction results could be obtained only based on the known drug-target interactions network. Drug similarity and target protein similarity network could not be introduced into this model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random forest</head><p>Based on the random forest (RF) learning algorithm, Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> proposed a large-scale computational method to predict potential drug-target interactions by integrating the information of chemical properties (e.g. compound fingerprints or substructures), the information of biology properties (e.g. biomedical and physicochemical properties of protein targets) and the drug-target association network information. However, because of the use of network features, this method cannot be applied to identify new interactions for a drug or a target that does not have any known drug-target interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two strategies for negative sample selection</head><p>As has been mentioned above, a common problem for supervised methods of drug-target interactions prediction is the lack of a negative data set. To address this problem, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> proposed two strategies to help general machine learning method better select the negative training samples. These two strategies aim at increasing the prediction accuracy in crossvalidation and filtering out as many non-drug-target proteins as possible, respectively. In the first strategy, the drug protein's deviation is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">n X i ? ? ? X j mean x j ? ? x ij ? mean x j ? ? ? ? var x j ? ?P mean x j ? ? 2 =var x j ? ?</formula><p>Here, for the ith drug proteins, vectorX i ? x i1 ; x i2 ; . . . ; x im ? ? represented m properties (attributes) of this protein, where x ij denoted the jth property's value of the ith drug proteins. Furthermore, x j ? x 1j ; x 2j ; . . . ; x nj ? ? denoted the vector of jth attribute. In the author's experiments, they chose the proteins with n X i ? &gt; 0:42 ? ?as the negative samples because they found the cumulative distribution indicated that n X i 0:42 ? ?&gt; 0:95. As for the second strategy, the probability of each unknown protein i to be negative sample was defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">P X i 2 NT ? ?? n X i ? ??mean n positive 2 X i n X i ? ??mean n positive 2</formula><p>In the author's experiments, they supposed each protein has a probability of 0.5 to be considered as the negative sample. Therefore, for the 3834 proteins in the test data set, they obtained 1917 proteins to function as a negative data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semi-supervised learning method</head><p>To face the challenge of negative samples selection problem, some semi-supervised methods were presented in which both few labeled data and many unlabeled data are integrated to make the prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NetLapRLS</head><p>Xia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> developed a semi-supervised learning method, NetLapRLS, which combines chemical space, genomic space as well as known drug-protein interaction network information into a heterogeneous biological space to predict potential drugtarget interactions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). This manifold regularization method uses labeled and unlabeled information instead of using labeled data alone to realize better prediction results for each chemical-protein pair. Firstly, the cost function of NetLapRLS is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">F ? d ? min J F d ? ? ?k Y ? F d k 2 F ? b d Trace F T d L d F d ? ?</formula><p>where k ?k F is Frobenius norm, Trace is the trace of a matrix, Y is the adjacency matrix of the known drug-target interaction network and b d is the trade-off parameter in the drug space. L d could be obtained by implement Laplacian operation to normalize the drug similar matrix W d as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">L d ? D ?1=2 d ?D d ? W d ?D ?1=2 d</formula><p>where D d is defined such that D d ?i; i? are the sum of the ith row of drug similar matrix W d . Then, we could obtain the solution of this optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">F ? d ? W d W d ? b d L d W d ? ? ?1 Y</formula><p>Similarly, the cost function and its corresponding classifier could be constructed in the target space as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">F ? p ? W p W p ? b p L p W p ?1 Y T</formula><p>where b p is the trade-off parameter in the target protein space, and L p could be obtained by implement Laplacian operation to normalize the target similar matrix W p . Therefore, two classifiers have been constructed in the drug space and target space, respectively. Final prediction results are obtained by implementing a mean operation for the prediction result from drug and target spaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kron-RLS</head><p>In previous studies, plenty of machine learning models have been developed for the drug-target interaction prediction models based on drug chemical structure and target genomic sequence similarity information. However, these traditional models are developed based on on/off interaction data, which do not reflect the real-life problem in practical cases of drugtarget interactions. In that case, most machine learning models treated the drug-target interaction prediction as a binary classification problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Drug-target interaction is not a simple binary on/off relationship. Pahikkala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> illustrated the effects of four factors that may improve the prediction performance of drug-target interaction prediction, including the problem formulation, evaluation data set, evaluation procedure and experimental setting. Especially, for the problem formulation, more realistic prediction results should be obtained by formulating the prediction problem as regression prediction, rather than traditional binary classification. Therefore, they further proposed the Kronecker RLS (Kron-RLS) model based on quantitative bioactivity data for kinase inhibitors [such as the dissociation constant (k d ) or inhibition constant (k i ) to reflect the whole spectrum of interaction affinity between a ligand molecule and a target molecule] to predict potential drug-target interactions. The systematic mapping provides broader insights into the interaction patterns between drug and targets. Given training drug-target pairs input data x i and their real-valued labels y i (interaction affinities), the prediction function could be obtained by finding a minimizer of the following objective function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">J f ? ? ? X m i?1 y i ? f ?x i ? ? ? 2 ? k k f k 2 k ; ?k &gt; 0?</formula><p>where k is the user-provided regularization parameter controlling the compromise between prediction error on the training samples and the model complexity, k f k k is the norm of f measured in the Hilbert space, and k is a kernel function obtained based on the drug chemical structure similarity and target protein sequence similarity, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemical similarities</head><p>Based on the assumption that similar drugs tend to interact with similar targets, Keiser et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> predicted underlying interactions between drugs and targets according to the chemical similarities between drugs and ligand sets, which are known to modulate the function of a few kinds of protein receptors. This method uses 2D structure similarities of ligands to infer a number of drug-target connections. Furthermore, 30 predicted interactions were tested experimentally and 23 new drug-target associations were confirmed. However, the available sequence information of protein targets is not taken into consideration here. Therefore, this method is limited to predict to the interactions between known ligands and different protein families.</p><p>A two-step similarity-based method Chen and Zeng <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> predicted target group of drugs using a two-step similarity-based method, which integrated graphrepresentation-based method and chemical-functional-grouprepresentation-based method. Firstly, drugs were encoded by their corresponding graph representation. Five target groups were denoted by C ? ?C 1 ; C 2 ; C 3 ; C 4 ; C 5 to indicate 'G Proteincoupled Receptors', 'Cytokine Receptors', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Ion Channels' and 'Enzymes', respectively. The target groups of any drug d i can be described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">C d i ? ? ? c i;1 ; c i;2 ; c i;3 ; c i;4 ; c i;5 ? ? T where c i;j ? 1 if C j is a target group of d i , otherwise, c i;j ? 0.</formula><p>Toward a query drug compound d, the possibility that C j is a target group of drug d was calculated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">S 1 d ) C j ? ? ? max S g d; d i ? ??c i;j</formula><p>where S g is the drug similarity matrix based on graph representations. Then, a similarity score was obtained based on chemical functional group representation for a query drug that does not get the prediction for its candidate target groups in the first step. Based on the assumption that compounds with the same functional group tend to react in a similar way, authors selected 28 major functional groups and represented each drug d by a 28dimension vector F d ? ? ? ?g 1 ; g 2 ; ? ? ? ; g 28 ? T . Towards a query drug compound d, the possibility that C j is a target group of drug d was further calculated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">S 2 d ) C j ? ? ? max S f d; d i ? ??c i;j S f d; d i ? ?? F d 1 ? ??F d 2 ? ? k F d 1 ? ? k ? k F d 2 ? ? k ; where F d 1 ? ??F d 2 ? ? is the dot product of two vectors F d 1 ? ? and F d 2 ? ?, and k F d 1 ? ? k and k F d 2 ? ? k are the modulus of vector F d 1 ? ? and F d 2</formula><p>? ?, respectively. Although these two kinds of representation methods were applied to encode query drugs, there are also some query drugs that cannot obtain prediction results, such as the drug without any similarity at all to all the drugs in training data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PMF</head><p>Cobanoglu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> developed a Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)-based active learning methodology to predict drug-target interactions, which does not rely on chemical/ target similarity or external data collection. The method is shown to group drugs according to their therapeutic effects instead of their 3D structure similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and conclusion</head><p>Identification of drug-target interactions is the important foundation of drug discovery. In this article, databases and web servers involved in drug-target identification and drug discovery are summarized. In addition, we mainly introduced some stateof-the-art computational models for drug-target interactions prediction, such as network-based models and machine learning-based models. Furthermore, we categorized machine learning-based model into supervised and semi-supervised model, which has essential difference in the adoption of negative samples. Most of these models take advantages of different types of biological data sets to implement prediction, but they only could predict the binary relationships between drugs and target. Wang and Zeng <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> successfully developed the first learning method to predict the types of drug-target interactions in the multidimensional network.</p><p>Network-based and machine learning-based models have their advantages and disadvantages. The key advantage of most of these approaches is that they are applicable to compounds without known 3D structures. Furthermore, almost all the models can effectively predict novel drug-target interactions for drugs, which have at least one known associated target proteins. More importantly, some models could be further applied to the new compounds without any known associated target proteins by integrating drug similarity, target similarity and known drug-target interactions.</p><p>As for the supervised machine learning method, it has important limitations as follows. Firstly, there are no experimental validated non-drug-target interactions so that it is difficult to select negative samples. Most of supervised learning method regard the unknown drug-target interactions or randomly select the unconfirmed drug-target pairs as negative samples, which would largely influence the predictive accuracy of the method. Secondly, two different classifiers from drug and target space are constructed in some methods, such as BLM; hence, the final result is the average of these two predictions, which will result in biases. Although semi-supervised learning method NetLapRLS makes use of the unlabeled information and overcome the difficulty of selecting negative samples, it also has the same limitation of classifier combination.</p><p>Nowadays, network has become an effective tool in potential drug-target interaction identification and drug repurposing. Focusing on the limitations of current network-based drugtarget interactions prediction models, the future direction of the network-based drug discovery could be summarized as follows. Firstly, more heterogeneous network about drugs and target proteins should be integrated, such as drug chemical structure similarity network, protein sequence similarity network, known drug-target interaction networks, drug side-effect network, metabolic network related to specific disease and target-protein interaction network. Furthermore, new developed networkbased computational models should be implemented on this heterogeneous network rather than the single network. In this way, even if there is no known target protein for the investigated drug, we still can obtain potential target of this drug based on the known targets of drugs without high similarity with this given drug. Then, the main limitation for almost all the network-based approaches is they cannot implement prediction for any drug-target pairs without known reachable paths in the network. As what has been pointed out in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, drug-target interaction network usually is composed of several isolated subnetworks, and most of current network-based methods cannot predict the interactions between the drug in one subnetwork and the target in another. Furthermore, existing network-based models tends to bias to the targets with more known associated drugs. Therefore, network tools should be further developed to solve these two critical problems in the future. Another future direction of network-based drug discovery is adopting global network information to capture the potential association between drugs and target proteins, whose advantage over local network information-based models has been demonstrated in many previous computational biology research. Finally, we are entering the era of personalized medicine and high-throughput genome sequencing, especially in cancer studies. The ultimate goal of biology in the future is to provide personalized treatment regimens for cancer patients, and it is improper to use a single or several drug targets for all the patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Therefore, the network approach should be applied to discovery personalized drugs by integrating the tumor clone-based network, cancer hallmark-based network and sequencing technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> have described the models with hallmark-based network to study the tumor clones and significantly accelerate the understanding of tumor evolution and tumorigenesis. Using this important and novel framework, they proposed many valuable drug discovery strategies. More importantly, network-based models could be constructed in this framework to solve many important problems as follows: (i) the prediction of personalized drug targets; (ii) drug resistance prediction; (iii) personalized drug effect prediction; (iv) personalized molecular signature identification for therapeutic evaluation after cancer treatment; (v) personalized cancer risk prediction for healthy individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. Successful network-based models for these important problems would have critical impact on timely diagnosis, personalized treatment, prognosis and personalized prevention of cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>.</p><p>It is well known that the data set used in the drug-target interactions prediction has great influences on the prediction performance. Nowadays, these constructed prediction models have shown their effectiveness in many network pharmacology applications, such as identifying new therapeutic indication of existing drugs and inferring potential synergistic drug combinations based on predicted drug-target interactions. However, they are often evaluated under overly simplified settings, and almost all the traditional machine learning prediction models treated the drug-target interaction prediction as a binary classification problem based on on/off interaction data, which do not reflect the real-life problem in practical cases of drug-target interactions. Pahikkala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> pointed out the following four important facts, which should be taken into consideration into the model development and evaluation because they can strongly influence the prediction performance: (i) problem formulation by more realistic regression formulation rather than standard binary classification; (ii) model prediction based on quantitative bioactivity data rather than on/off interaction data; (iii) model validation based on simple or nested crossvalidation; (iv) model performance report based on different experimental setting to find out whether training and test sets share common drugs and targets, only drugs or targets or neither.</p><p>Specially, the quantitative data would make the prediction results more accurate and provide broader insights into the interaction patterns of the drugs and targets, while the binary data sets usually ignore many important aspects of the drugtarget interactions, including their dose-dependence and quantitative affinities. Some of the recently published data have involved information about the strength interaction binding affinities, so it is possible to consider the interaction prediction as a regression problem of the binding affinities rather than as a classification problem of whether there is an interaction. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Metz et al. (2011)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> put forward to combine sequence-dependent and pharmacology-dependent networks in a harmonious way and further constructed a comprehensive kinome interaction network based on both sequence comparisons and multiple pharmacology parameters obtained from activity profiling data. They successfully collected &gt;150 000 kinase inhibitory values of &gt;3800 compounds tested against 172 different protein kinases. Furthermore, a robust statistical analysis of kinome profiling data was implemented. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Davis et al. (2011)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> tested the interaction of 72 known kinase inhibitors against a panel of 442 kinases assays covering &gt;80% of the human catalytic protein kinome, which provides a comprehensive data set of kinase inhibitors across the kinome. These two large-scale data sets for clinically relevant kinase inhibitors provided the quantitative bioactivity spectra, including the kinase disassociation constant (K d ) and kinase inhibition constant (K i ) data sets. These data sets based on biochemical selectivity assays provided broader insights into the interaction patterns of kinase inhibitors. It is well known that plenty of regression models have been constructed and successfully applied to many important practical applications, so it is anticipated that regression model would play critical and important roles in the future drug-target interactions prediction.</p><p>For most of the aforementioned computational models, prediction performance is evaluated based on cross validation. However, the recent study demonstrated that the performance based on cross validation differences between in-sample and out-of-sample interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. In that study, they further performed experiments for protein-protein interactions prediction based on seven state-of-the-art methods and observed that the performance of each method differs significantly in different test classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. While the study mainly concerns evaluation schemes for protein-protein interactions, the same principles apply for all the pair-input computational prediction problems. In our previous studies, we have developed the computational model of Laplacian Regularized Least Squares for LncRNA-Disease Association (LRLSLDA) to predict potential lncRNA-disease associations and further applied this new validation framework to evaluate the performance of LRLSLDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. As a result, LRLSLDA have obtained an excellent predictive performance in different classes. Specially, for the drug-target interactions prediction problems, the paired nature of inputs leads to a natural partitioning of test pairs, and pair-input models may achieve significantly different predictive performances for distinct test classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. According to the evaluation methods proposed in this article, the test samples of target-drug associations could be classified into four distinct classes: C1 is composed of the test samples sharing both drugs and targets with the training samples; C2 is composed of the test samples sharing only drugs with the training samples; C3 is composed of the test samples sharing only targets with the training samples; C4 is composed of the test samples sharing neither drugs nor targets with the training samples. Therefore, for the drug-target interaction prediction, it is important and necessary to report cross validation performance for all the four independent test classes.</p><p>Compared with other reviews such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>, the research results covered in this article are more comprehensive. Sixteen state-of-the-art computational methods for drug-target interactions prediction have been included in this review and most of which with their core formulas and the figures demonstrating theirs basic ideas or procedures. For example, the model of Kron-RLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, which introduced a new research direction into drug-target interaction prediction research, is hardly mentioned in previous reviews. Then, we have collected plenty of databases and web servers. Furthermore, we made a discussion about the strength interaction binding affinities, drug-target interactions prediction based on regression rather than traditional on/off classification and the new cross validation framework, which would have a major impact on predictive research. After previous excellent review presented by Ding et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>, plenty of new computational models, databases, web servers have emerged. For example, Pahikkala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> illustrated the effects of four factors that may improve the prediction performance of drug-target interaction prediction, formulated the prediction problem as regression prediction and further developed the model of Kron-RLS based on quantitative bioactivity data for kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, the first learning method to predict not only the binary interactions between drugs and targets but also different types of interactions have been constructed in the framework of RBM based on a multidimensional drug-target network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Considering the common problem for supervised models is the lack of negative samples, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> proposed two strategies to help general machine learning method better select the negative training samples. Some new computational models for traditional drug-target on/off interactions also have been developed, such as the model of RF, within-scores and between-scores, BLM-NII, a two-step similarity-based method and PMF. Especially, the model of BLM-NII could solve the limitation of BLM that it cannot predict the interactions for new drug or target candidates by integrating NII and existing BLM model. Besides, plenty of new databases have been constructed, such as The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (the data of pharmacological, chemical, genetic, functional and pathophysiological are included), CancerDR (provide comprehensive information of anti-cancer drugs, and their pharmacological profiling across 952 cancer cell lines) and ASDCD (the first DCDB devoted to antifungal drug research, aiming with antifungal drug combinations and drug-target interactions). Furthermore, some previous databases have been updated frequently, such as DrugBank (contain 7759 drug entities and 15 199 drug-target interactions), TTD (1755 biomarkers for 365 disease conditions, and 210 drug scaffolds for 714 drugs, and leads have been further added), and STITCH (the number of high-confidence chemical-protein interactions in human has increased by 45%). It is also worth noting that some easy-to-use web servers have been constructed recently, such as DINIES, SuperPred and SwissTargetPrediction.</p><p>Nowadays, a wide range of databases and web servers about drug-target interactions have been built, providing a variety of resources of drug space, target space, drug-target interaction network, side-effect network and other related networks. Therefore, making full use of different types of heterogeneous data sources, the computational predictive models can realize more accurate identification of new drug-target interactions.</p><p>Ideally, to overcome the limitations of the supervised models, both true-positive interactions and true-negative pairs should be reported in the databases and web servers. Experimentally measured negative samples would provide significant improvement in the performance of prediction models. Furthermore, although the source programs or software of some computational models are available, it may be difficult to use, and more easyto-use web servers should be constructed in the future, which would benefit biologists to experimentally confirmed predicted drug-target interactions.</p></div>
