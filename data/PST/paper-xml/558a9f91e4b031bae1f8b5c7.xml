It should be skipped by old hands with their own cognitivc map of the field. The next five sections summarize the DIA tasks addressed in PAMI in the last twii decades. Only PAMI papurs arc cited, but a short bibliography provides additional cntry points to the literature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">PAMI vs. Current Practice</head><p>We consider DTA and OCR as csscniially cnginccring disciplines, although a case c m be made for a morc fundamental role. Publislicd work (not ouly in P A M ) has been moderately succcssful in anticipating emerging applications. The many papers on hand-printed aiid handwritten character recognition (cf. nrticlc by Platnotidon atid Srihari in this issue) probably did contributc t o current products, but some of the print rccognition muthuds c&gt;xplored by rcscarchcrs risk lagging the capabilities of give-away shrink-wrapped page readers. The research emphasis in character recognition has long favorcd "universal" algorithms, whereas the commercial emphasis is now on tool kits that can be ctistomized for large, homogenous applications. Thcrc was little in PAMI that foreshadowed the rapid ct)riversion of large archivcs of prinlcd material for digital libmrics.</p><p>Published research 011 forms processing lags bchind thc niany challciiging applications and the need for further iinprovemcnt. Crnphics rccognitioii shuitld connect with current CAD practiccs kr, improve thc widely-used interactive techniques for engineering drawing and map conversion. We must be innre alert to guide the cxtraction of hidden structure from indigenous electrtniic documents images (which we hercby define as corrrputwcrct7tcd rlocunimts tiint hove ficvcr been sunriiicd but appmr iii s w i e unstruutrrnd~~rmmt like GIFF or TIFF). Research on document image security, authentication ("digital watcrmarking") and privacy should not fall behind commercial products. Some of tlicsc issues wcrc thc topics of conference presentations, but never made it to P A W . Pitially, W P hopc that our survcy for the 40th anniversary issiie will include m n c critical ovcrvicws uf tcst protocills, benchmarking, evaluation, validation, ancl standard ciala scls that arc essential for tlie health of a mature discipline.</p><p>Oti the pnsitivc sidc, wc round die SCILITCE of many ideas that are now part of the infrastruclirrc. Character rccognition has long been a favorite test vehiclc for goiicralpurpose classification algorithms and stimulatcd thc. cxaitiination of important issues in feature selection, clustcring, and small-sample estimation of classifier. parameters and of cmor ratw (cf. <ref type="bibr">Jain et al.,</ref> in this issue). Graphics recognition is a wonderful application of syntactic a i d structtiral methods. Document layout annlysis i s image pmwssiiig, while document content analysis draws 011 machinc learning. DIA bcncfits from and contributes to artificial inklligcncc?, cspccially in natural language understanding, knowledge representation, and ncural nciworks. Symbiosis aside, the number of specifically UTA-c~rientcd papers published. in PAM/ has grown significantly in kliho last f i w ycars (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). The articlcs show increased sophistication and apprcciation of enginwring aspects.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">DIA in Context</head><p>Document image analysis i s the subfield of digital image prnccssiiig that aims at converting document images to symbolic form for modification, storage, rctrieval, reuse, arid transmission. It helps the transition from bookshelves and filing cabinets to tlw papcrlcss (and pcr'haps w u n wirclcss) world. Although here i s no evidence yet of less paper, electronic documents already abound.</p><p>Rcgardlcss of how irnagcls arc obtained, we rnay classify them according to their content. For our purposes, it is cnnvcnicnt t(1 divide thum intn Lwt~ categories: nutrrrnl and syriibolic. Portraits, Fingerprints, aerial photographs, satellite images, and X-rays depict natural scciics or objects. On tlie o h c r hand, push1 addrvsscs, printed arliclcs, burcaucratir forms, sheet miisic, engineering drawings, and topographic maps represent symbolic objects. We t1icrcfrn.c propose the following working dcfinitiun:</p><p>Dwunimt image analysis (UIA) is the theory and practice of recovering the symbol strocture of digital images scanned from p a p or produced by computer.</p><p>For ease of reading, pictures of symbols tend to bc produced with high contriist: most text and line art is essciitially black-on-whitc. Color is applicd wherc IICCESsilry, without fine tonal gradations (though trendy inagazincs often splash color without regard for lcgibility). l'hokngraphs arc rcproduccd as halftones. Accordingly, linear signal-anal ysi s tcchni ques bawd on freqiiency lrnnsforms are less prevalent iii 13IA than in computer visjon and in natural picture prticcssing.</p><p>There is considerable current interest in recognizing incidental text (license plates, billboards, and subtitles) in photographs aiid video. It may therefore bc convenient tn extcnd the dcfinitinri of DIA to any multimedia recording. He.re, hawwer, w e will limit d o c u w ~t to objects created cxprcssly to convcy inforinnkinn cnccid~d as icunic symbols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">A Short Tour of DIA</head><p>Thc field arose well before digital computers could represent inforimtion that traditioua Ily appeared on papcr.</p><p>Patents on optical chnmctcr recognition, for reading aids for the blind and for input to the telegraph, were filcd in tlic 10th century, and working models were demotistrated by 1916, but DIA HS we know it is only about 40 years old. OCli on specially dcsigiicd printcrl digits (OCR fo,nts) W R S first uscd in business in thc 1950s. The first postal address readei:s and the Social Security Administration machine t o read typewritten earnings reports were iiistallcd in :l965. Uoviccs t o rend Lypusct maturial and simple hand-printed fornis came into their own in the <ref type="bibr">1.980s</ref>, when the prices of OCR systcms droppcd by a factor of ten duo to the advent of micmproccssnrs, bit-mappcd displays, aiid solid-state scanners.</p><p>Within aiiotlzer decade, optical disks and tape cai:tridgcs had sufficient capacity, at ii reasonable price, for: storing thousands of docuinciit images in tlic forin of criinpressed bitmaps. Interest grew quickly in converting h c m to computer-searchable form. In 1999, ~( J c u / ~w / I ~ h g i n ~, i.c., clectroiiic documont skoragc without sophisticated image manipulation, is a billioii-dollar busincss, but DIA, when considered as document imagc i~tcrprehfion, is still only a small part of it. It is fortunate that such a practical ficld uf study has so many intcllcclidy sbiinulating aspects.</p><p>Thc cinly priiiciplos of physics that impact DIA are those that govern the yracluction of documents through printing, copying, and digitization. However, the quality o f these technology-sensitive stcps has enorinous effect on tlie coinplcxity of extracting information. 'The combined cost of conversion niid processing dctcrmines where DTA can displace human data cntry and correction.</p><p>Thc digitized images can be stored in a simple array format. Once the symbolic information is extracted and interpreted, tlic best formal: depends on the application at hand. Some formats are rooted in word processors (e.g., RTF), page ctmposition software (LATEX, PIIF), web briiwscrs (HTML), or drafting programs (DXP). Others arc constructed specifically for the manipulaticm of scanned documents (UAFS, XDOC, and ODIL). The many formats, and the methods of converting one to anc&gt;tlwr, seldoni form the topic of research articles (but we include a glossary of acronyms) I Some of the early stages cif processing scanned documeizts are indcpcndent of the type of document. Many noise filtering, binarization, edge extraction, and segmentation methods can be applied cqually well to printed or handwritkm tcxt, line drawings or maps. Half-tones rcquirc specialized trcalmcnt. (Binarization docs, uf course, segment gray-scalc pictures. Rut wc prefer to reserve sqiirentatiori for methods that inay be applicablc cven to already binarizcd pictures. Connected coinponents analysis is often the starting point hcrc, but its development has not been chroniclcd ii1 PAMI.)  Once a document is segmentcd into its constituent components, more specific tcclmiques are nuedcd. Traditionally the field has differentiated between .msIIy text and ir~osHy graphics documents. Mostly-tcxt pages are separated into columns, paragraph-blocks, text-lines, words, and characters. OCR converts the individual word or character images into B character code like ASCI[ nr Unicodc. But, there is m u c h more to a text documcnt than a string o f symbols. Additional, and sometimes essential, information is conveyed by long-cstidAished conventions cif layout and format, choice of type sizc and typeface, italics and boldfacc, and the two-dimensional arrangement of tables and formulas. To caytiire tlie wholc meaning of a docu-Inclit, DIA must extract and interpret ail of this subtle encoding. (Nowadays, this information about information is called metadnta, but thc term has different meanings in library science, web searches, programming, and scripting langiiagcs.) Specialized techniqucs arc! appropriate and affordable for high-volume text applicaiions likc ciivelopes, business letters, bank-checks, and invoices.</p><p>Engineering drawings, maps, music SCCII'CS, schematic diagrams, and organization charts are examples of mostlygraphics documents. Iine drawings are deconiposed into straight-linc and curve segments, junctions and crossings before higher-level components, such as dimcnsions, center-lines, and cross-hatching can be interpreted. M a p may require color separation, and the association of text (labels) with map symbols. Line drawings typically contain a great deal of lettering that must be located, perhaps isolatcd, and recognized. The extcacliuii o f information from digitizcd photographs remains a thriving topic of rcscarch, but since photographs s~ldrnn contain symbolic objects, our main coiicern in D1A is mistaking them for text or line drawings.</p><p>At every stage of research, it is essential t o bc able to display the results of processing in a form suitable for human judgment. Accurate rendering of digitizcd pictures at various scales requircs some care.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> is our nltuiiipt to fit the major conccpts of DIA into a coherent schcma. We divide the analysis into five steps according to the granularity of tlie process. Here we have opted to group dcicunients into only two types. The major decision Is top-down vs. bottom-up analysis. In mostly text processing, topdown analysis attempts to find thc larger components, likc columns and paragraph blocks, beforc procccding to the text-linc and word levels. Hottcnnup analysis forms words into text-liiics, lincs into paragraphs, and so on 1631. Because black pixels arc usually a niiich snialler fracticm of a line drawing than of tcxt, most tcchniques for graphics arc bottom-up appronchcs. The distinction is elusive, bccause both methods must access individual pixels, c uns, o r connected components. In our survey, we have chosen Lo proceed from small k) large, and to summarize work on mostly text separately from research on mostly graphics. Documevrt imp urrdcrstandivig (or intcrprefatiun) is the formal representation of the abstract relationships indicated by the two-dimensional arrangement of the symbols. (In contrast, doowzent u n d e r s t n ~d i ~g rcfcrs to the natural language aspects cif one-dimensional text flow.) Domainspecific knowledge appcars essential for document interpretation. To the best of our knnwlcdge, no one has ~v c r attempted to develop a systcin to interpret arbitrary documunts (consider the knowledge required to uiidcrstand tlw periodic table, a forcign railroad schedule, an IRS form, a chartered accountant's report, or an abstruse formula).</p><p>Both model-driven and data-driven approachcs have bcen investigated. Models have been developcd for formulas, equations, business fomnis, tables, flowcharts, meclianical drawings, circuit schematics, music, and chess notation. Some of thew models reflect the properties of natural language, while otlwrs have domain-specific CUIIstraints, I i ke the ccmcspondence between a dimension stateincnt and the radius of an arc, thc rules that determine whether an equation is well Enrnwd, and the relationships belwocn the fields of an invoicc. Tlic models and undcrlying assumptioiis are not always cxplicitly stated in descriptions of new approaches.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">3</ref> is a document taxonomy that ernyhasizcs the DlA rcquircincnts related tn the syinbolic structure.

Their method is based on the complementary relationship between chai:acters and their backgrounds ;-is indicated by a similarity iiieasure fm black and white runs.</p><p>In general, the appropriate binarization threshold is a scnsitivc function of the local rcflcctancc map, but for highcontrast printed matter, it is difficiilt to improve on a fixed threshold centered between the extrcmc obscrved values. In adopting published binarixa tion algorithms for applications, in which the gray-level distribution is not clear1.y bimodal, it i s important to take into consideration the amplitude transfer function of thc specific scanner, as well as tlic s p t i a l and gray-scalc charackcristics of thc iinngu. WO echo a statement from [83] that still rings true today: "Howevcr, no siiiglc thrcaholding scht.mc givcs satisfactory segmentation resu Its on a variety of images".</p><p>Motivated by the observation that voting OCK labeis obtained from multiple scans of the same page resulted in il substantial decrease in error rate, Sarkar et alj 1701 examined the interplay between sampling and t11rcshoIding and counted the number of different bitmaps that can be produced for the same pattern by random displacement o f thc sampling grid. As shnwn earlier, tlic resulting unccrtainty limits thc prucision with which small pattems can be located <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>, [25] but tlw effect is less significant with gray-scale scans. It also affects clectronically-prodttced documents converted to bitmeps for. display, and impedes character rccognitiun in GlPF pictures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Skew Detection</head><p>Almost as many algnrithms have been developed for skew detection as for binarixation. All of thein arc accurate on full pages of uniformly aligned printed kxt. l'hc better nlgoritluns are less affcctud by tlic presence of graphics, paragraphs with difkrcnt skcw, curvilinear distortion arising from photocopying books, largc arcas of dark pixels near thc margin, and few, short text lines.</p><p>A rinvcl method is the Subspaced-l3ased Linc Dctcction bawd on an analogy between text-lines on a pago and a linear antenna array emitting a planar prepgating wilvcfront 111. The distance from a reference linc of cacli fnrcground pixel is converted into the phase of a complex sine wrlvc. Tlic detcction algorithm, based on radar signal processing, dctcrmincs the spatiill coherence bctwccn thc contrihtions from diffcrcnt rows in the image. Aghajan and Kailath [l] claiincd that their method was more efficient and more accurate C m tcxt skcw than the Hough algoi-ithm (which is, however, srldcrm used for documents without extensive rnodifiratiori). I( is not clear from the paper whether any paramctcr rcquirca adjustment for type size or line spacing.</p><p>One method was desigiicd spccifically for Indian scripts like Devanagari and Bangla [13] that have i i tiead line (shiuowklra or mntm). It was develiipcd RS part of a complete Bangla. OCR system. 'I'he rcsulls rrf skew detection proved comparable to those from the Hough transform, but require lcss computation.</p><p>After skew detection, the page image is often rotated to a reference direction to lacililatc furthcr format analysis and OCR. On binarized pagcs the rotpired resampling tends to distort the ctiaracter pattcms. Instead, it may be possible to modify the proccssiiig algurithrns to take into accnuiit the skew <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[34]</ref>. Alternatively, eithrr the dr)cumcnt can be rotated bcfore binarization, or the rotation can bc approximated by small, distortion-free translations ol entiru word blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Character Segmentation</head><p>In 1996, Casey and Lccolinct [ l l ] surveyed the many approaches that have been proposcd since 1959 to segment touching or lragincritcd character patterns. Missegmentation of characters is responsible for many OCR errors (e.g., r II .-1 i n 01 111 4 I-n). It is thp consensus that light patterns arc' inore difficult than //envy patterns, perhaps bccilust? of the greater import ol missing and already scarce foreground pixels. The degrcc of difficulty dcpcnds on the typeface and print-sourcc (smudged italics are difficult to segment) as rvcll as on tlie ratio of font sizc to scanner resolution (poinl-sprcad function and spatial sampling rate).</p><p>Cascy and Lecolinet [ II] dpfined disscctim as the attempt t o dividc thc image into classifiablc units, whereas recugnitiuji-btmd s c p w i tntioli either classifies a inulticharacter block at once, or segments the image according to features extracted from the entire block. Hybrid clasdfication is a kind of sofl wgmcntation, where the choice bctwccn inultiplc scgmentation candidates is bnscd on recognition. A finc example of the latter appcarcd in PAMI soon after the survey 1511. Ifere thc rviiincrs among the jaggcd boundaries, imposed on the gray-scalu pattcrns by pie-segmentation, are determitied by the optimal path through a word-scale lattice (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[68]</ref>).</p><p>This comprehensive and scholarly survcy cniicentrated evalitate the effectirreness of the various approaches. (By happcnstanco, a l i w l y cxplnnation of the difficulties of benchmarking scgmcntalirm, in a diCfcrctit vctiiic, appcared in the preceding article of the same issue <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>).

Rcsampling on gray-level arrays is relatively cnsy, but bilincar or bicubic interpolation distorts bilcvcl cliaracl-crs. The standard alternative is a two-stage proccss.</p><p>Thc original smooth contour of the salnplcd cliaracter is First apprtixiinatcd usiiig R weighted convolution filter and bilevel stnplitude quantization.

The three Oriental scripts are then recognized according to histograms of foreground pixel densitics. Thc languages in Latin scripts are identified by the frequency of chnrncteristic Word Shape Tnkens (such as high-high-lnw For "the" in English, high-low for "lc" and "la" in French, and high-low-low for "der" and "das" in German). Spitz uses run-lcngth coding, bounding boxes, atid the pass codcs of CCX'lTG4 to specd up processing. The Han/Liitin dichotomy apyoars infallible. The thrcc Oriental scripts arc rccognizcd when more than a couple of text lines are awilablc. Sume European languages arc rccognlizcd with only YO percent accuracy.

[I51 presented thcir formal analysis of the GR lGmlilr Keprusertlotiun) of a bilevel image long a f k r applying it to the large-scale convcrsioil of land register maps. The GK is a general-purpose structure of adjaccnt foreground runs similar to thc LAG and the BAG. It can be used for extracting conncctcd components, Euler numbcrs, diameters, convcx hulls, concavities, and convexities. It is also an efficient data structure for vectorjxatiun.</p><p>13ccausc of the large size of maps, thcre is a premium on spccd. <ref type="bibr">Yaiiiada et al. [95]</ref> developed R set of mdtiailgled parallcl (MAP) anisotropic neighborhood operations, that they called dircctional morphology, for cartographic fcaturci;. Tlicy extracted linear features and hatchcd areas using a VITcc image processor attached to a SUN. The main contribution of this paper was the extension of the multiplane computational framework to symbol inatclung.</p><p>The fundamental priiblcm in line art analysis is accurate, fast vectorization. Since most drawings consist of an overwhelming majority of background pixels and long chains of connected foreground pixels, the trick is to avoid processing all the backgruund pixels while recovering the continuity d the foreground pixels, Most vectorization algorithms approximate curved lines by sequences o f short straight-line scgments, but that only postpones intcrpretation. Uori [MI applied to arc segmentation the orthogonal zig-zag vectorizatioi~ (OZZ) algorithm that he had developed a few years earlier, The basic zig-zag algorithm finds a chain of "bars." Arc centers are hypothesizcd at the intersections of the perpendicular bisccturs of straight-line segments with monotonically changing slopes. More complex pixel-level processing is required to detect circles, locate accurately thc ccnter and end points of circular arcs, maintain continuity with tangent lincs, and alleviate the cffccts of small holes and islands.</p><p>Furthci* cxperimentation evidently convinccd Dori's group to base arc segmcntatioil on fully vectorized images. The resulting incremental method <ref type="bibr">[93]</ref>, that progressively chcckv tlie cocircdarity of clustered arc fragments, is faster than thc above hybrid method. X t is also very accurate, as deinoi~strated both on a multitudc of synthetically generated bitmaps and on a "host" of real-life drawings including dashed arcs. The algorithm was rcportcd to work well on arc segments greater than 10 pixels in radius, 7r/4 in angle, and one pixel in width.</p><p>Dnri also revisited O Z Z and turncd it into the Sparse Pixel Vectorization (SPV) algorithm [ 171. SPV approximates arc fragments more accurately and visits only a subset of points on the medial axis of a segment. The tracing bounces from the edge of a strip to its center and, hence, to an edge fiuther along the curve. Points between the detected ccntcr points are interpolated. Line width is preserved. Special provisions are, of course, necessary for line endings, junctinns, and intersections. Several quality measures were dcvolopcd and applied to vectorization of complex drawings from different source's. As expected, the algorithms performed well. It takes 3 to 5 seconds for a 1,000 x 1, Olio pixel drawing with mderate line densities. The code for Sun Solaris is available by ftp. This article contains an informative discussion of vectorization and of the pros and cons of alternative appruachcs.</p><p>The separation of tuxt from graphics has been challcnging researchers for many years. A recent communicaticiii in PAMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[54]</ref> proposed extracting thc text by erasing all the pixels that are part of long lincar components, are in regions of low stroke density, belong to largc dense configurations, or art? not adjacent to a siring of similar components. This is accomplished in a series of steps that draw on the recognition of already idmtificd components and gradually isolate the text. Thc method was demonstrntcd on many examples, some with inixcd Chinese/l.atin/Greek/Arabic lettering or digits. Although most of the text was extracted successfully, it is marred by graphics residuals that would impede recognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Drawing Interpretation</head><p>In 1983, Hunke <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> extcndcd the notion of attributed programmed string grammars to graph grammars. Prugrammed grammars control the order in which productions are applied. An attribute can be the location of a vertex or the l w g f h of a line segment. The graph grainmar acts as a generator to transform thc graph representation of an input drawing to the graph represontation of its description. The method was applied tci schematic diagrams. Extensions were presented, without any direct application tn graphic documents, in <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref>. In addition to his influential work in DIA, Burtke hosted and cditcd the 1992 SSPIZ, and was coeditor of the Hn?adbook uf Uitaritctur Recognition and Uocunretzt hinge <ref type="bibr">Annlysis.</ref> Sometime bcforc 1983, researchers at the Toshiba Rcsuarch and Development Center reached the remarkable conclusion that drawing logic circuit schematics carefully on paper, scanning them on a drum scanner, recognizing them using a special-purpose computer, and correcting thc residual errors with an intmactive computer-aided drafting/design systcin, would be about twice as fast as cntcriiig and correcting them with CAD tools alone. Ozaki and his colleagues [6G] developcd tlw required automatic drawing interpretation system. Their article, which is one of the few detailed descriptions of an operational graphics-recognition system, has been widely citcd. Evcn now, it represents an endeavor far beyond thc scope of most academic rcscarcliers.</p><p>Ozaki ct <ref type="bibr">al. [66]</ref> focused 011 the recognition of loop symbols that occur by tlic hundreds in logic diagrams. Their decision-tree-cont roll ed approach combined connected component analysis, thinning, filtering, lino tracing, multiple clipping-windows, 2 x 2 masks, geometric and topolo-gical features, and digital tcmylaks dcrivcd from drafting templates. They distinguishcd 93 clnssos of ~ymlmls divided into 14 subcategories. The image processor was implemented with special-purposc, pipelined, multiprocessor tiard- ware (this wzs probably initiated about 1980; the saiiie issw nf PAMI contains two articles about parailel imagc processing computers of the same vintage). A n interaclive decision-tree editor: provided the required support for adding new symbols and characters to the recognition logic. Character rccognition was accomplished with nttributed string matching developed earlier.</p><p>The system was tested in the development nf 79 gatearray circuits on over 8511 drawings of up to JIS A1 size (594 mm x 811 mm), gray-scanned at 250 dpi. The 'IO participating draftsmen wc'rc hold to strict drawing standards. Thc symbols wow rccogiikcd with less than 1 percent crror and lcss than 3 percent reject. Processing A1 drawings took 30 minutes, of which half was taken for symbol and character recognition. One catinol help wondering how much the trade-off between interactive graphics entry and automated drawing recognition has been affectcd by their relative progress in the intervening years.</p><p>At about the same time, Kasturi, nt Pcnnsylvania State University, began to systematically tackle tlw various subtasks of graphics conversion. With Flctchcr, he extracted strings of text from lint! drawings [20]. Their method is based on connected component analysis followed by thc application of the Hough transform to find isolated collinear blubs of the size predicted by area-histcigram analysis of all the components. The paper contains a listing of the requirements on the size and spacing of the characters for robust text extraction. (This papor really belongs in Seclioii 5.1, but is inclitded here for crmtiiuiity.)</p><p>In 1390, with a largc group of MS students, <ref type="bibr">Kastiiri [42]</ref> developed the tuols ncccssary to identify outline and solid polygonal objects and their spatial containment hierarchy, circular arc segments, hatched areas, dashed lines, connectors between objects, and text strings (including phrases and words touching or overlapping tlic linc art). '['hey exploited many of thc same graphics techniques as Ozaki c t al., including coniwcted components, collinear compoiwnt grouping, thinning, boundary tracking, loop analysis. The image-specific parameters and thresholds that would have to bc modified for different applications are tabulated. A test imagc dcvdopcd fur tuning some of the algorithms (Pig. 10) found application as a bench rnark.</p><p>The next correspondence, with h i , nddrussed a n important component of mechanical drawings, thc dimension sets. ' h i s was also the targct of Dori's early research, published elsewhere. ANSI dimeiisions have a complex syntax for arrowhuads and tails, leaders, datum markcrs and fcature control frames. They are normally either horizontal or vertical, and although thc lcadcr pairs may cross other graphic components, the lettering is isolated. To avoid confusion with dashed lines and to take advantage cif the isothetic orientation, Eai mid <ref type="bibr">Kasturi [49]</ref> abandoncd the Hough transform and resorted to tmciiig the text strings from small cnnnoctL*d compoiients suspected of characterhood. A large (20,000 lines of C cridu) and principled experimental systcm model.ed on the human perception cycle is prcscntcd in [35].

A set of schema classes describes solid, dashed, and chained lincs, solid aiid dashed curves, cross hatching, physical outlines, text, witncss and leader lines, and certain forms uf dimensioning. Each schcma inaintains geometric and structural clcscriptitriis of the entity it represents. Tracing the drawing can bc initiated autoinatically and refined with interactively specified start p i n t s and radii. The article is concerned more with methodology than performance. Like Icasturi's, the system had nrr provision for text recognition, but it could Teconstrwt (render) the recognized data structure for coniparison with tlihc <ref type="bibr">original.

MAGELLAN (Map Acquisition of Ccographic L.abels by Legend Analysis) is the front-end imagc processing system for MARCO.

His objective was to determine whether a scanned photo is, or is not, the same as the originally scanned photo. Differences in the photo-signatrirc between tlw two digitized itnages may arise due to scanning and to physical dctcrioration of the printed photo betwccn the two scans. The method encodes several multiresolution versions of the photo (constructed from the highest resolution image) into a few dozen bytes according to the relative intensities of adjacent pixels. The photo-signature (a well-chosen term) yielded error rates of under '1 percent on a few hundred small mug shuts (from the NIST database) gray-scanned at 300 dpi. O'Gorman suggested that ihc signahires be stored in a central database, or combined with some textual information, encrypted with thc ANSI standard nigilal Signature Algorithm, and stored on thc identification card itself. Alternative identification methods bawd on signatures, fingcrprints, and face recognition are discussed elsewhere in this issue.</p></div>

Additive noise and isolated specks have been filterud and averaged out and are now on thc elidangered species list.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Problems Remaining</head><p>There are still a few aspccts of preprocessing that might benefit from incrcascd attention. :Exploiting compressed formats for improving the spccd of subsequent processing remains appealing. We need to find better techniques for color separation o f few-color documents and halftone backgrounds or expioit color as we do gray scale. The reconstruction of overlapping rulings and text (often the result of printing from multiplc source layers) needs building on some good beginnings.</p><p>We arc far from being able to c{invcrt complex enginceriiig drawings and maps to any CAD format. lnstcad of attempting tu build graphics interpretation from the ground up, perhaps we should bcgin where the commercial systems leave off. To the extent that human intervention remains nccussary, we might givc more thought to whew it is best applied a i d how the automated parts of the system can profit from it.</p><p>OCR rcscarch must aim tn decrease ci'ror rates by more than an order uf majpitude on poor images from old fax machines, copiers, or high-speed printing on cheap paper. It is vexing that language context hclps least where acciiracy is most important, as on propcr nouns and numcric fields! Several directions c m be explorcd:</p><p>Feature-based multifont document image dccr&gt;ding; Adaptation of more direct I-IMM methods to twodimensional document pixel maps (instead of considering text lines as a form of speech); Largc-vocabulary word or partial-word rccngnition combined with word-transition probabilities; Style-based recognition that exploits consistency of typeface, layout, and documcnl-quality; and Application-oriented benchmarking and classification of tccliniqucs. We can nwcr resist pi4osdytizing for Ieaming and adaptation. Pcrhaps static rccognition is now good enough to Lakc a frcsh look at dynamic systems. Confidently recognized pat terns can hclp identify their inore ambigiious brethren. (The speech community is certainly moving in that direction. Bootstrap training is widely used h r HMM). Exploiting feedback from human editing and downstream validation stiftwarc that rcflects the application-specific error pntkrns should lead to systems that improve with use. JZecent theoretical results that cxplorc the combination of supcrviscd aiid unsupervised learning might apply. Pcrlxips tlw SSS (syntactic, structural, and statistical) fedciation should seck a rapprochement with the machinc-learning community. Document content tagging is just around the corner. XML will play ail important role as a target representation in application-specific DIA. Extracthg XML tags will require a principled approach to the critical interface between DlA front-ends and back-ends that incorporate database managemcnt systems, wwk-flow, or formal table-models. Similar considerations apply to drawings and high-level CAD/ CAM data interchangc standards, and to maps and <ref type="bibr">GIs. 13IA</ref> products cannot bo expected to function in isohtion.</p><p>Computer-generated documents in impoverished digital h m a t s that preclude full access to content are proliferating.
