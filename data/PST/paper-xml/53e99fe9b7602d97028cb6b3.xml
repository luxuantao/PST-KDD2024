<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction 1.Approach</head><p>Coalition formation has been a research topic of continuing interest in the area of coalitional games. It has been analyzed from several points of view, starting with <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, where the static situation of coalitional games in the presence of a given coalition structure (i.e. a partition) was considered.</p><p>In this paper we consider the perennial question 'how do coalitions form?' by proposing a simple answer: 'by means of merges and splits'. This brings us to the study of a natural problem, namely under what assumptions the outcomes of arbitrary sequences of merges and splits are unique.</p><p>These considerations yield an abstract approach to coalition formation that focuses on partial preference relations between partitions of a group of players and simple merge and split rules. These rules transform partitions of a group of players under the condition that the resulting partition is preferred. By identifying conditions under which every iteration of these rules yields a unique partition we are brought to a natural notion of a stable partition.</p><p>This approach is parametrized by a generic preference relation. The obtained results depend only on a few simple properties, namely irreflexivity, transitivity and monotonicity, and do not require any specific model of coalitional games.</p><p>In the case of coalitional TU-games the preference relations induced by various well-known orders on sequences of reals, such as leximin or Nash order, satisfy the required properties. As a consequence our results apply to the resulting preference relations and coalitional TU-games. We also explain how our results apply to hedonic games (games in which each player has a preference relation on the sets of players that include him) and exchange economy games.</p><p>This approach to coalition formation is indirectly inspired by the theory of abstract reduction systems (ARS), see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, one of the aims of which is a study of conditions that guarantee a unique outcome of rule iterations. In an earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> we exemplified another benefit of relying on ARS by using a specific result, called Newman's Lemma, to provide uniform proofs of order independence for various strategy elimination procedures for finite strategic games.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Related work</head><p>Because of this different starting point underpinning our approach, it is difficult to compare it to the vast literature on the subject of coalition formation. Still, a number of papers should be mentioned even though their results have no bearing on ours.</p><p>In particular, rules that modify coalitions are considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in the presence of externalities and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> in the presence of binding agreements. In both papers two-stage games are analyzed. In the first stage coalitions form and in the second stage the players engage in a non-cooperative game given the emerged coalition structure. In this context the question of stability of the coalition structure is then analyzed.</p><p>The question of (appropriately defined) stable coalition structures often focused on hedonic games. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> considered four forms of stability in such games: core, Nash, individual and contractually individual stability. Each alternative captures the idea that no player, respectively, no group of players has an incentive to change the existing coalition structure. The problem of existence of (core, Nash, individually and contractually individually) stable coalitions was considered in this and other references, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> compared various notions of stability and equilibria in network formation games. These are games in which the players may be involved in a network relationship that, as a graph, may evolve. Other interaction structures which players can form were considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, in which formation of hierarchies was studied, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, in which only bilateral agreements that follow a specific protocol were allowed.</p><p>Early research on the subject of coalition formation is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. More recently, various aspects of coalition formation are discussed in the collection of articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and in the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Initially, we obtained the corresponding results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in a limited setting of coalitional TU-games and the preference relation induced by the utilitarian order.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Plan of the paper</head><p>The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we set the stage by introducing an abstract comparison relation between partitions of a group of players and the corresponding merge and split rules that act on such partitions. Then in Section 3 we discuss a number of natural comparison relations on partitions within the context of coalitional TU-games and in Section 4 by using arbitrary value functions for such games.</p><p>Next, in Section 5, we introduce and study a parametrized concept of a stable partition and in Section 6 relate it to the merge and split rules. Finally, in Section 7 we explain how to apply the obtained results to specific coalitional games, including TU-games, hedonic games and exchange economy games.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Comparing and transforming collections</head><p>Let N = {1, 2, . . . , n} be a fixed set of players called the grand coalition. Non-empty subsets of N are called coalitions. A collection (in the grand coalition N ) is any family C := {C 1 , . . . , C l } of mutually disjoint coalitions, and l is called its size.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">If additionally l j=1 C j = N , the collection C is called a partition of N . For C = {C 1 , . . . , C k }, we define C := k i=1 C i .</formula><p>In this article we are interested in comparing collections. In what follows we only compare collections A and B that are partitions of the same set, i.e. such that A = B. Intuitively, assuming a comparison relation £, A £ B means that the way A partitions K, where K = A = B, is preferable to the way B partitions K.</p><p>To keep the presentation uniform we only assume that the relation £ is irreflexive, i.e. for no collection A, A £ A holds, transitive, i.e. for all collections A, B, C with A = B = C, A £ B and B £ C imply A £ C, and that £ is monotonic in the following two senses: for all collections A, B, C, D with A = B, C = D, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A ∩ C = ∅, A £ B and C £ D imply A ∪ C £ B ∪ D,<label>(m1)</label></formula><p>and for all collections A, B, C with A = B and A ∩ C = ∅,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A £ B implies A ∪ C £ B ∪ C.<label>(m2)</label></formula><p>The role of monotonicity will become clear in Section 5, though property (m2) will be already of use in this section. In what follows we study coalition formation by focusing on the following two rules that allow us to transform partitions of the grand coalition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">merge: {T 1 , . . . , T k } ∪ P → { k j=1 T j } ∪ P , where { k j=1 T j } £{T 1 , . . . , T k } split: { k j=1 T j } ∪ P → {T 1 , . . . , T k } ∪ P , where {T 1 , . . . , T k } £{ k j=1 T j }</formula><p>Note that both rules use the £ comparison relation 'locally', by focusing on the coalitions that take part and result from the merge, respectively split. In this paper we are interested in finding conditions that guarantee that arbitrary sequences of these two rules yield the same outcome. So, once these conditions hold, a specific preferred partition exists such that any initial partition can be transformed into it by applying the merge and split rules in an arbitrary order.</p><p>To start with, note that the termination of the iterations of these two rules is guaranteed. Note 2.2. Suppose that £ is a comparison relation. Then every iteration of the merge and split rules terminates.</p><p>Proof. Every iteration of these two rules produces by (m2) a sequence of partitions P 1 , P 2 , . . . with P i+1 £ P i for all i ≥ 1. But the number of different partitions is finite. So by transitivity and irreflexivity of £ such a sequence has to be finite.</p><p>The analysis of the conditions guaranteeing the unique outcome of the iterations is now deferred to Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TU-games</head><p>To properly motivate the subsequent considerations and to clarify the status of the monotonicity conditions we now introduce some natural comparison relations on collections for coalitional TU-games. A coalitional TU-game is a pair (N, v), where N := {1, . . ., n} and v is a function from the powerset of N to the set of non-negative reals<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> such that v(∅) = 0.</p><p>For a coalitional TU-game (N, v) the comparison relations on collections are induced in a canonic way from the corresponding comparison relations on multisets of reals by stipulating that for the collections A and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">B A £ B iff v(A) £ v(B),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where for a collection Given two sequences (a 1 , . . ., a m ) and (b 1 , . . ., b n ) of real numbers we define the (extended) lexicographic order on them by putting</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A := {A 1 , . . ., A m }, v(A) := {v(A 1 ), . . ., v(A m ) },</formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">(a 1 , . . ., a m ) &gt; lex (b 1 , . . ., b n ) iff ∃i ≤ min(m, n) (a i &gt; b i ∧ ∀j &lt; i a j = b j ) or ∀i ≤ min(m, n) a i = b i ∧ m &gt; n.</formula><p>Note that in this order we compare sequences of possibly different length. We have for example (1, 1, 1, 0) &gt; lex (1, 1, 0) and (1, 1, 0) &gt; lex <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1)</ref>. It is straightforward to check that it is a linear order.</p><p>We assume below that a = {a 1 , . . ., a m } and b = {b 1 , . . ., b n } and that a * is a sequence of the elements of a in decreasing order, and define</p><p>• the utilitarian order:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">a ut b iff m i=1 a i &gt; n j=1 b j ,</formula><p>• the Nash order:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">a N ash b iff m i=1 a i &gt; n j=1 b j ,</formula><p>• the elitist order:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">a el b iff max(a) &gt; max(b),</formula><p>• the egalitarian order:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">a eg b iff min(a) &gt; min(b),</formula><p>• the leximin order:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">a lex b iff a * &gt; lex b * .</formula><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> these relations were considered for sequences of the same length. For such sequences we shall discuss in Section 4 two other natural orders. The intuition behind the Nash order is that when the sum m i=1 a i is fixed, the product m i=1 a i is largest when all a i s are equal. So in a sense the Nash order favours an equal distribution.</p><p>The above relations are clearly irreflexive, transitive and linear. Additionally the following holds.</p><p>Note 3.1. The above relations are all monotonic both in sense (m1) and (m2).</p><p>Proof. The only relation for which the claim is not immediate is lex . We only prove (m1) for lex ; the remaining proof is analogous.</p><p>Let arbitrary multisets of non-negative reals a, b, c, d be given. We define, with e denoting any sequence or multiset of non-negative reals, len(e) := the number of elements in e, µ := (a ∪ b ∪ c ∪ d) * with all duplicates removed, ν(x, e) := the number of occurrences of x in e,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">β := 1 + len(µ) max k=1 {ν(µ k , a ∪ b ∪ c ∪ d)}, #(e) := len(µ) k=1 ν(µ k , e) • β -k .</formula><p>So µ is the sequence of all distinct reals used in a ∪ b ∪ c ∪ d, arranged in a decreasing order. The function #(•) injectively maps a multiset e to a real number y in such a way that in the floating point representation of y with base β, the kth digit after the point equals the number of occurrences of the kth biggest number µ k in e. The base β is chosen in such a way that even if e is the union of some of the given multisets, the number ν(x, e) of occurrences of x in e never exceeds β -1. Therefore, the following sequence of implications holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">a * &gt; lex b * and c * &gt; lex d * ⇒ #(a) &gt; #(b) and #(c) &gt; #(d) ⇒ #(a) + #(c) &gt; #(b) + #(d) ⇒ #(a ∪ c) &gt; #(b ∪ d) ⇒ (a ∪ c) * &gt; lex (b ∪ d) *</formula><p>Consequently, the corresponding five relations on collections induced by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>) are all semi-linear comparison relations.</p><p>As a natural example of a transitive relation on multisets of reals that is not monotonic consider av defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">a av b iff ( m i=1 a i )/m ≥ ( n j=1 b j )/n.</formula><p>Note that for</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">a := {3 }, b := {2, 2, 2, 2 }, c := {1, 1, 1, 1 }, d := {0 } we have both a av b and c av d but not a ∪ c av b ∪ d since {3, 1, 1, 1, 1 } av {2, 2, 2, 2, 0 } does not hold.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Individual values</head><p>In the previous section we defined the comparison relations in the context of TU-games by comparing the values (yielded by the v function) of whole coalitions. Alternatively, we could compare payoffs to individual players. The idea is that in the end, the value secured by a coalition may have to be distributed to its members, and this final payoff to a player may determine his preferences.</p><p>To formalize this approach we need the notion of an individual value function φ that, given the v function of a TU-game and a coalition A, assigns to each player i ∈ A a real value φ v i (A). We assume that φ is balanced, i.e. that it exactly distributes the coalition's value to its members:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">i∈A φ v i (A) = v(A).</formula><p>For a collection C := {C 1 , . . . , C k }, we put</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">φ v (C) := {φ v i (A) | A ∈ C, i ∈ A }.</formula><p>Given two collections C = {C 1 , . . . , C k } and C = {C 1 , . . . , C l } with C = C , the comparison relations now compare φ v (C) and φ v (C ), which are multisets of | C| real numbers, one number for each player. In this way it is guaranteed that the comparison relations are anonymous in the sense that the names of the players do not play a role.</p><p>In this section, to distinguish between comparison relations defined only by means of v and those defined using both v and φ, we denote the former by £ v and the latter by £ φ .</p><p>We now examine how these two different approaches for defining comparison relations relate. To this end, we will clarify when they coincide, i.e. when given a comparison relation defined in one way, we can also obtain it using the other way, and when they are unrelated. We begin by formalizing the concept of anonymity. Definition 4.1. Assume a coalitional TU-game (N, v).</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">• An individual value function φ is anonymous if for all v, permutations π of N , i ∈ N , and A ⊆ N φ v i (A) = φ v•π -1 π(i) (π(A)). • v is anonymous if for all permutations π of N and A ⊆ N v(A) = v(π(A)).</formula><p>Note that for all A we have (v•π -1 )(π(A)) = v(A). Intuitively, φ is anonymous if it does not depend on the names of the players and v is anonymous if it is defined only in terms of the cardinality of the argument coalition.</p><p>The following simple observation holds.</p><p>Note 4.2. For any v and φ, if £ v and £ φ are the utilitarian order (as defined in Section 3), then for all collections C and C , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">φ v (C) £ φ φ v (C ) iff v(C) £ v v(C ). Proof. Immediate since A∈C v(A) = A∈C i∈A φ v i (A) = A∈C,i∈A φ v i (A).</formula><p>For other orders discussed in Section 3 no relation between £ v and £ φ holds. In fact, we have the following results.</p><p>Theorem 4.3. Given v and £ v , it is in general not possible to define an anonymous individual value function φ along with £ φ such that for all collections C and C , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">φ v (C) £ φ φ v (C ) iff v(C) £ v v(C ).</formula><p>This holds even if we restrict ourselves to anonymous v.</p><p>Proof. Consider the following game with N = {1, 2}:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">v({1}) := 1 v({2}) := 1 v({1, 2}) := 2,</formula><p>and take £ v to be the Nash order as defined in Section 3. This yields both</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">v({{1, 2}}) = {2 } £ v {1, 1 } = v({{1}, {2}}) and v({{1}, {2}}) £ v v({{1, 2}}).</formula><p>However, the symmetry of the game and anonymity of φ forces</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">φ v ({{1, 2}}) = {1, 1 } = φ v ({{1}, {2}}),</formula><p>so we have either</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">φ v ({{1, 2}}) £ φ φ v ({{1}, {2}}) and φ v ({{1}, {2}}) £ φ φ v ({{1, 2}}) or φ v ({{1, 2}}) £ φ φ v ({{1}, {2}}) and φ v ({{1}, {2}}) £ φ φ v ({{1, 2}}).</formula><p>Theorem 4.4. Given v, φ and £ φ , it is in general not possible to define £ v such that for all collections C and C , we have v(C)</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">£ v v(C ) iff φ v (C) £ φ φ v (C ).</formula><p>This holds even if we restrict ourselves to anonymous v, anonymous φ, and a Nash, elitist, egalitarian or leximin order (as defined in Section 3) for £ φ .</p><p>Proof. Consider N = {1, . . . , 4} and</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">v(A) := 6 for all A ⊆ N φ v i (A) := v(A) |A| .</formula><p>Then we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">φ v ({{1}, {2, 3, 4}}) = {6, 2, 2, 2 } φ v ({{1, 2}, {3, 4}}) = {3, 3, 3, 3 },</formula><p>which are distinguished by each of the mentioned £ φ , while</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">v({{1}, {2, 3, 4}}) = v({{1, 2}, {3, 4}}) = {6, 6 }.</formula><p>These results suggest that the two approaches for defining preference relations are fundamentally different and coincide only for the utilitarian order.</p><p>In the case of individual values we can introduce natural orders that have no counterpart for the comparison relations defined only by means of v. The reason is that for each partition P , φ v (P ) can be alternatively viewed as a sequence (of payoffs) of (the same) length n. Such sequences can then be compared using</p><p>• the majority order :</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">(k 1 , . . ., k n ) m (l 1 , . . ., l n ) iff |{i | k i &gt; l i }| &gt; |{i | l i &gt; k i }|,</formula><p>• the Pareto order :</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">(k 1 , . . ., k n ) p (l 1 , . . ., l n ) iff ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n} k i ≥ l i and ∃i ∈ {1, . . . , n} k i &gt; l i .</formula><p>The relation m is clearly irreflexive and monotonic both in sense (m1) and (m2). Unfortunately, it is not transitive. Indeed, we have both (2, 3, 0) m (1, 2, 2) and (1, 2, 2) m (3, 1, 1), but (2, 3, 0) m (3, 1, 1) does not hold. In contrast, the relation p is transitive, irreflexive, monotonic both in sense (m1) and (m2), and linear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Stable partitions</head><p>We now return to our analysis of partitions. One way to identify conditions guaranteeing the unique outcome of the iterations of the merge and split rules is through focusing on the properties of such a unique outcome. This brings us to the concept of a stable partition.</p><p>We follow here the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, although now no notion of a game is present. The introduced notion is parametrized by means of a defection function D that assigns to each partition some partitioned subsets of the grand coalition. Intuitively, given a partition P the family D(P ) consists of all the collections C := {C , . . . , C l } whose players can leave the partition P by forming a new, separate, group of players ∪ l j=1 C j divided according to the collection C. Two most natural defection functions are D p , which allows formation of all partitions of the grand coalition, and D c , which allows formation of all collections in the grand coalition.</p><p>Next, given a collection C and a partition P := {P 1 , . . . , P k } we define  • if C is a partition of N , then C[P ] = P ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">C[P ] := {P 1 ∩ C, . . . , P k ∩ C} \ {∅}</formula><p>• if C ⊆ P , that is C consists of some coalitions of P , then</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">C[P ] = C.</formula><p>In general the following simple observation holds. The following observation holds, where we call a partition P of N £maximal if for all partitions P of N different from P , P £ P holds.</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">Theorem 5.3. A partition of N is D p -stable iff it is £-maximal.</formula><p>In particular, a D p -stable partition of N exists if £ is a semi-linear comparison relation. P</p><p>Proof. Note that if C is a partition of N , then C[P ] = C is equivalent to the statement P = C, since then C[P ] = P . So a partition P of N is D p -stable iff for all partitions P = P of N , P £ P holds.</p><p>In contrast, D c -stable partitions do not need to exist even if the comparison relation £ is semi-linear. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> another example is given for the case of TU-games and utilitarian order. More precisely, a TU-game is defined in which no D c -stable partition exists, where £ is defined through (1) using the utilitarian order ut .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Stable partitions and merge/split rules</head><p>We now resume our investigation of the conditions under which every iteration of the merge and split rules yields the same outcome. The following main result of the paper provides an answer in terms of the D c -stable partitions. Theorem 6.1. Suppose that £ is a comparison relation and P is a D c -stable partition.

P This theorem generalizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, where this result was established for the coalitional TU-games and the utilitarian order. It was also shown there that there exist coalitional TU-games in which all iterations of the merge and split rules have a unique outcome which is not a D c -stable partition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Applications</head><p>The obtained results do not involve any notion of a game. In this section we show applications to three classes of coalitional games. In each case we define a class of games and a natural comparison relation for which all iterations of the merge and split rules have a unique outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Coalitional TU-games</head><p>To show that the obtained results naturally apply to coalitional TU-games consider first the special case of the utilitarian order, according to which given a coalitional TU-game (N, v), for two collections P := {P 1 , . . ., P k } and Q = {Q 1 , . . ., Q l } such that P = Q, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">P £ Q iff k i=1 v(P i ) &gt; l i=1 v(Q i ).</formula><p>Recall that (N, v) is called strictly superadditive if for each pair of disjoint coalitions A and B v(A) + v(B) &lt; v(A ∪ B).</p><p>Further, recall that given a partition P := {P 1 , . . ., P k } of N and coalitional TU-games (P 1 , v 1 ), . . ., (P k , v k ), their union (N, ⊕ k i=1 v i ) is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">(⊕ k i=1 v i )(A) = k i=1 v i (P i ∩ A).</formula><p>We now modify this definition and introduce the concept of a semi-union of (P 1 , v 1 ), . . ., (P k , v k ), written as (N, ⊕ k i=1 v i ), and defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">(⊕ k i=1 v i )(A) := (⊕ k i=1 v i )(A) if A ⊆ P i for some i (⊕ k i=1 v i )(A) - otherwise</formula><p>where &gt; 0.</p><p>So for P -incompatible coalitions the payoff is strictly smaller for the semiunion of TU-games than for their union, while for other coalitions the payoffs are the same. It is then easy to prove using Lemma 6.3 that in the semiunion (N, ⊕ k i=1 v i ) of strictly superadditive TU-games the partition P is D cstable. Consequently, by Theorem 6.1, in this game P is the outcome of every iteration of the merge and split rules.</p><p>The following more general example deals with arbitrary monotonic comparison relations as introduced in Sections 3 and 4.</p><p>Example 7.1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Hedonic games</head><p>Recall that a hedonic game (N, 1 , . . ., n ) consists of a set of players N = {1, . . ., n} and a sequence of linear preorders 1 , . . ., n , where each i is the preference of player i over the subsets of N containing i. In what follows we shall not need the assumption that the i relations are linear.

It is straightforward to check that £ is indeed a comparison relation and that the partition P satisfies then conditions (2) and (3) of Lemma 6.3. So by virtue of this lemma P is D c -stable. Consequently, on the account of Theorem 6.1, the partition P is the outcome of every iteration of the merge and split rules.</p></div>

The intuition is that the players' preferences over outcomes weigh most, but in case of ties the players prefer smaller coalitions.</p><p>It is easy to check that £ is a comparison relation. We now prove that the partition P is D c -stable w.r.t. £. First, note that by the definition of the initial endowments for all l ∈ {1, . . . , k} and coalitions A ⊆ P l there is an outcome z A ∈ V (A) which gives exactly |A| units of good j to each player j ∈ A. We have z A i x for all i ∈ A and x ∈ V (A). This implies that P is D c -stable by Lemma 6. Consequently, in the above game, by Theorem 6.1 the partition {P 1 , . . ., P k } is the outcome of every iteration of the merge and split rules.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Definition 2 . 1 .</head><label>21</label><figDesc>By a comparison relation we mean an irreflexive and transivite relation on collections that satisfies the conditions (m1) and (m2).

P This brings us to the following notion. Assume a defection function D and a comparison relation £. We call a partition P D-stable if C[P ] £ C for all C ∈ D(P ) such that C[P ] = C. The last qualification, that is C[P ] = C, requires some explanation. Intuitively, this condition indicates that the players only care about the way they are partitioned. Indeed, if C[P ] = C, then the partitions of C by means of P and by means of C coincide and are viewed as equally satisfactory for the players in C. By disregarding the situations in which C[P ] = C we therefore adopt a limited viewpoint of cooperation according to which the players in C do not care about the presence of the players from outside of C in their coalitions.</figDesc></figure>
