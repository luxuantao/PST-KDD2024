Please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for a more comprehensive overview of the field.</p><p>As an important research topic in the distributed coordination of multi-agent systems, group consensus (also called cluster synchronization) has attracted much attention from various scientific communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Roughly speaking, the whole network in the group consensus problem will be divided into multiple sub-networks with information communication between them, and its research focuses involve the design of appropriate protocol to drive the agents in the same subnetworks to an agreement.</p><p>Encouragingly, great deals of excellent research results about group consensus have emerged constantly. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Yu and Wang considered the group consensus problem in a multi-agent system with switching topologies and communication delays. Furthermore, by introducing double-tree-form transformation, the dynamic equation of agents was transformed into a reduced-order system, and some sufficient conditions were presented. It should be noted that the protocols proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> are purely continuous-time ones, which means that the channels between different groups must exist continuously. Based on the above framework, Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> investigated the group consensus problem with the novel hybrid protocol in case of discontinuous information transmissions among different groups, and some algebraic criteria to guarantee the group consensus were established. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Wang and Cao studied the cluster synchronization problem in nonlinearly coupled non-identical dynamical systems, and obtained some useful synchronization criteria by applying pinning control to a fraction of network agents. Moreover, Su et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> considered the pinning control problem for cluster synchronization of undirected complex dynamical networks, and proposed a novel decentralized adaptive pinning-control scheme on both coupling strengths and feedback gains. More recently, Qin and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> investigated the cluster consensus control for generic linear MASs under fixed and switching directed interaction topology, and it was shown that the cluster consensus behavior was irrelevant to the magnitude of the couplings among agents under the interaction topologies with acyclic partition. Furthermore, based on the above results, Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> studied the cluster synchronization for network of linear systems via a generalized pinning control strategy, and it was proven that the cluster synchronization can be achieved if the induced network topology of each cluster has a directed spanning tree. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, Ji et al. elaborated the group consensus of the linearly coupled multi-agent systems including firstorder and second-order, respectively, and two novel linear protocols were proposed.</p><p>However, almost all the aforementioned results are based on some conservative assumptions, which need to be further generalized in several cases of real applications. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, it is required that the weights between different sub-networks satisfy the in-degree balance condition, i.e., the sum of adjacent weights from every agent in one sub-network to all agents in the other sub-network should be equal to zero, which is too strong to make the multi-agent systems achieve group consensus in reality. Moreover, the in-degree balance condition has been removed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, but it is required that the adjacent weights between different sub-networks are nonnegative, hence the topology considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is the cooperation network. Recently, competition relationship between agents has been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which is inevitable due to the limited resources. Thus, it is more practical to investigate the group consensus problem in the cooperation-competition network. It needs to be emphasized that the adjacent weights between different sub-networks rely on the in-degree balance condition is permitted to be negative, which means that the topology in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> can be the cooperation-competition network. Meanwhile, the group consensus in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is the static case, where the consensus state of every sub-network is a constant, and it also limits its practical applications. Furthermore, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Pinning control strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> has been proposed to force the agents in the same sub-network to follow a desired trajectory, which is a dynamic group consensus. Note that in pinning control framework, one need to determine how many agents to pin and to design the pinning control gains. However, it is still a quite difficult problem to find at least how many agents should be pinned for a given network in reality, and the pinning control gains obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> are very conservative, which are much larger than the needed values.</p><p>Mainly with the above inspirations, in this paper, we focus on a dynamic group consensus problem in the cooperationcompetition network without the in-degree balance condition and pinning control strategy. Specifically, in our framework, the whole network is divided into two sub-networks, and the weights between the agents in the same sub-network are positive, while the weights between the agents among different sub-networks are negative. It means that the agents cooperate with their neighbors in the same sub-network, while they compete with the neighbors from different sub-networks. Then, the couple-group consensus problem is firstly studied, and the concept of a mirror graph of a cooperation-competition network is defined to solve this problem. Moreover, it is proven that the couple-group consensus problem can be achieved provided that the mirror graph of the cooperation-competition network is strongly connected. Besides, it is not necessary to assume that the interaction topology of each sub-network is strongly connected or contains a directed spanning tree, instead competition relationship plays a positive role in the dynamic group consensus. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the sum of the couple-group consensus states is zero (called reverse group consensus in this paper), which is sometimes referred as bipartite consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Moreover, bipartite consensus in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> has been studied by the characteristic of signed graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and it was shown that bipartite consensus can be achieved when the signed graph of the network is structurally balanced. Interestingly, signed graph can be used for predicting the outcome of an opinion forming process in a social network <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Recently, interval bipartite consensus has been investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, which has been proved that all the agents can reach interval bipartite consensus if the associated signed digraph has a spanning tree. Furthermore, as an extension, the decomposing of the cooperation-competition network is discussed. The concept of a condensation undirected graph of a cooperation-competition network, as well as the path balance condition, is defined. It is found that if the condensation undirected graph is path balance, the cooperation-competition network can be divided into two sub-networks with competition relationship between them.</p><p>An outline of this paper is as follows. In Section II, some basic definitions in the cooperation-competition network and system model are provided. In Section III, reverse group consensus is proposed, and the main analytical results are obtained. In Section IV, a numerical example is presented to verify the theoretical analysis. Finally, Section V gathers our conclusions and ideas for future work.</p><p>Throughout this paper, R and R n denote the set of real numbers and the set of n × 1 real column vectors, respectively, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 n = [1, . . . , 1] T ∈ R n .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES</head><p>In this section, some basic definitions in the cooperationcompetition network and system model are firstly introduced for the subsequent use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Topology Description</head><p>In general, information communication between agents in a multi-agent system can be modeled by a network or graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Specifically, let = (V, ζ, A) be a weighted directed network with a vertex set V = {π 1 , π 2 , . . . , π N }, an edge set ζ ⊆ V × V , and a weighted matrix A = [a ij ] representing the communication topology. Moreover, an edge means that there is a directed path form π j to π i of , and is denoted by e ij = (π i , π j ) which is associated with a nonzero weight, i.e., (π i , π j ) ∈ ζ ⇔ a ij = 0, and the neighbor set of agent π i is denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N i = {π j |(π j , π i ) ∈ ζ}. A directed path of length l in = (V, ζ, A</formula><p>) is a sequence of edges in a directed graph of the form ((π i 1 , π i 2 ), (π i 2 , π i 3 ), . . . , (π i l , π i l+1 )), where (π i j , π i j+1 )∈ ζ for j = 1, . . . , l. Here, it should be noted that a ij &lt; 0 also makes sense, which means that agent π j competes with agent π i , and such a network is called the cooperationcompetition network <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Then, for every agent π i , the neighbor set can be divided into two parts, i.e., N i = {π j |a ij &gt; 0} {π j |a ij &lt; 0}, which are denoted by N i + and N i -representing the cooperation and competition neighbors of π i , respectively.</p><p>Next, let us introduce a new directed graph = (V , ζ, A) with the same vertex set in , there is an edge between a pair of distinct agents π i and π j if and only if (π i , π j ) ∈ ζ( ), and the weight of the edge (π i , π j ) in is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">|a ij |. The new directed graph = (V , ζ, A) is called the mirror graph of the cooperation-competition network = (V, ζ, A).</formula><p>Note that the mirror graph is the cooperation network due to non-negative weight. Furthermore, to investigate the dynamic group consensus problem, the whole network will be divided into multiple sub-networks, then denote c as the condensation undirected graph of the cooperation-competition network , which is defined as follows: the vertex set consists of all the sub-networks in , i.e., denote π i as sub-network i, and there is an edge between a pair of distinct sub-networks π i and π j if and only if there exists</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">π i ∈ V ( π i ) and π j ∈ V ( π j ), such that (π i , π j ) ∈ ζ( ).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. System Model</head><p>Motivated by the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, we consider the dynamic group consensus problem in the cooperation-competition network. In our framework, the whole network is divided into multiple sub-networks, and the weights between the agents in the same sub-network are positive, whereas the weights between the agents among different sub-networks are negative. Furthermore, each agent with time-varying input has the following dynamics:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ ẋi (t) = ṙi (t) -α(x i -r i ) + β j∈N i + a ij (x j -x i ) + γ j∈N i - a ij (x j + x i ) + v i vi (t) = αβ j∈N i + a ij (x j -x i ) + αγ j∈N i - a ij (x j + x i ) (1)</formula><p>where x i , v i ∈ R are variables associated with agent i, and r i (t) is the input of agent i. Obviously, the inputs of the agents varies from one to another, and it makes our results more general. Moreover, α, β, and γ are the positive constants, which can be used to tune the algorithm performance.</p><p>Remark 1: In (1), the term a ij (x jx i ) represents the information communication between the cooperation neighbor j and agent i, which is the same as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and while the term a ij (x j + x i ) is considered as the information communication between the competition neighbor j and agent i. Moreover, it is easy to see that the competition term is different from those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Due to the fact that a ij (x j + x i ) = (-a ij )(-x jx i ), competition relationship in this paper is defined as that agent j competes against agent i if and only if the inverse of agent j cooperates with agent i.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MAIN RESULTS</head><p>In this section, the reverse group consensus problem for multi-agent system (1) is investigated. The convergence analysis is presented and several effective sufficient conditions are established. Furthermore, the decomposing of the cooperationcompetition network as an extension is also discussed.</p><p>Firstly, suppose the whole network consists of two subnetworks, and the agents have the dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Without loss of generality, let a network topology = (V, ζ, A) consist of n + m(n, m &gt; 1) agents. Then the first n agents constitute a subnetwork 1 with the Laplacian matrix L 1 , and the rest m agents constitute the other sub-network 2 with the Laplacian matrix L 2 . Meanwhile, it is assumed that the weights in the same sub-network are positive, while the weights between different sub-networks are negative. Furthermore, denote the index sets</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I 1 = {1, 2, . . . , n}, I 2 = {n + 1, n + 2, . . . , n + m}.</formula><p>In order to obtain the main results, the following definition is needed.</p><p>Definition 1: For the cooperation-competition network with two sub-networks, the multi-agent system (1) is said to asymptotically achieve quasi-reverse group consensus under the condition that (1/n) j∈I 1 r j (t)=-(1/m) j∈I 2 r j (t), if for any initial states of systems (1), there exists a parameter σ &gt; 0, such that the states of agents satisfy lim t→∞ x i (t)-(1/n) j∈I 1 r j (t) ≤ σ, ∀ i ∈ I 1 , and lim t→∞ x i (t)-(1/m) j∈I 2 r j (t) ≤ σ, ∀ i ∈ I 2 . Furthermore, if σ = 0, the multi-agent system (1) is said to asymptotically achieve reverse group consensus.</p><p>Remark 2: The parameter σ in Definition 1 is called the error level <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which reflects the deviation degree of (1/n) j∈I 1 r j (t) (or (1/m) j∈I 2 r j (t)). It should be noted that the inputs of the agents are required to satisfy the condition that (1/n) j∈I 1 r j (t) = -(1/m) j∈I 2 r j (t), which is necessary to achieve reverse group consensus for the multi-agent system (1). In fact, when the multiagent system (1) achieves reverse group consensus, information communication between the agents should vanish, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">j∈N i -a ij ((1/n) j∈I 1 r j (t)+(1/m) j∈I 2 r j (t)) = 0, ∀ i ∈ I 1 I 2 , and one has (1/n) j∈I 1 r j (t) = -(1/m) j∈I 2 r j (t).</formula><p>Next, the term <ref type="formula">1</ref>) represents information communication between the agents in the cooperation-competition network, which can be rewritten with a compact form (2), shown at the bottom of the next page, and the matrices in (2) are denoted as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">β j∈N i + a ij (x j -x i )+γ j∈N i -a ij (x j +x i ) in (</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">Λ 1 = diag ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ j∈I 2 a 1j , . . . , j∈I 2 a nj ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ Λ 2 = diag ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ j∈I 1 a n+1j , . . . , j∈I 1 a n+mj ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ B 1 = ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ a 1n+1 • • • a 1n+m . . . . . . . . . a nn+1 • • • a nn+m ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ∈ R n×m B 2 = ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ a n+11 • • • a n+1n . . . . . . . . . a n+m1 • • • a n+mn ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ∈ R m×n . Furthermore, denote Γ = γΛ 1 -βL 1 γB 1 γB 2 γΛ 2 -βL 2</formula><p>, and it is obvious that matrix Γ = [Γ ij ] affects the behavior of the agents in the cooperation-competition network. Hence, before the main results are introduced, the following lemma combines Gershgorin disk theorem to provide spectral characterization of matrix Γ = [Γ ij ] of the cooperation-competition network .</p><p>Lemma 1: Suppose that matrix Γ = [Γ ij ] represents a cooperation-competition network with two sub-networks, then the following statements hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(i) All of the nonzero eigenvalues of Γ = [Γ ij ] have nega- tive real parts; (ii) Matrix Γ = [Γ ij ] has a zero eigenvalue with the eigen- vector 1 T n , -1 T m T ∈ R n+m ; (iii) If the mirror graph of the cooperation-competition network is strongly connected, then zero is a simple eigenvalue of Γ = [Γ ij ].</formula><p>Proof: According to the definition of matrix Γ = [Γ ij ], one can obtain that</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Γ ii = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ γ j∈I 2 a ij -β j∈I 1 a ij ∀ i ∈ I 1 γ j∈I 1 a ij -β j∈I 2 a ij ∀ i ∈ I 2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and one has Γ ii ≤ 0, ∀ i ∈ I 1 I 2 . Moreover, it follows that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">j =i |Γ ij | = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ -γ j∈I 2 a ij + β j∈I 1 a ij ∀ i ∈ I 1 -γ j∈I 1 a ij + β j∈I 2 a ij ∀ i ∈ I 2 . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>Hence, one concludes that</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Γ ii + j =i |Γ ij | = 0, ∀ i ∈ I 1 I 2 ,</formula><p>and Gershgorin disk theorem implies that all of the nonzero eigenvalues of Γ = [Γ ij ] have negative real parts, and this completes the proof of (i).

This completes the proof. Remark 4: In Theorem 1, by using the mirror graph, the reverse group consensus of the multi-agent system (1) is solved asymptotically. In our framework, the initial states of the agents should satisfy the condition i∈I 1 v i (0) = i∈I 2 v i (0), which yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, then the states of the agents in the same sub-network track the dynamic average of their inputs, and the sum of group consensus states of two sub-networks is zero (called reverse group consensus).</p><p>Remark 5: It should be noted that different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the in-degree balance condition is removed in this paper, and the extra competition relationships between the agents in different sub-networks is considered, where the adjacent weights are negative. Moreover, we do not assume that the sub-network topology is strongly connected or contains a directed spanning tree in Theorem 1, thus the whole network described by matrix Γ = [Γ ij ] has a more general network topology than those considered in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which makes our results more promising in a broad range of practical applications. Meanwhile, competition relationship plays a positive role in the reverse group consensus of this paper. In fact, competition relationship indirectly increases the chance of information communication between the agents in the same sub-network without information communication.</p><p>Remark 6: The convergence rate is crucial for the reverse group consensus, which indicates how quickly the agents in the cooperation-competition network achieve it. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, one can conclude that the multi-agent system (1) achieves reverse couple-group consensus exponentially with the convergence rate min {α, ρ, ξ}. Obviously, the convergence rate of reverse group consensus depends on the design parameters α, β, γ, the communication topology represents by matrix Γ = [Γ ij ], and the characteristic of the inputs of the agents. Furthermore, when the multi-agent system (1) achieves quasi-reverse group consensus, the explicit expression of the error level in Theorem 1 is derived by σ = c Γ /ρ, which can also tune the parameters α, β, γ to improve the performance of the error level.</p><p>Obviously, one precondition in Theorem 1 is that a cooperation-competition network can be divided into two subnetworks, and the relationship between them is competitive. However, in the practical multi-agent systems, the number of agents may be large, making it quite difficult to verify this premise directly. Therefore, it requires us to seek an effective technical way to solve this problem.</p><p>Given a cooperation-competition network = (V, ζ, A), one may relegate the agents with positive weights to the same sub-network firstly. It should be noted that the number of sub-networks may be larger than two. Without loss of generality, suppose that the cooperation-competition network is composed of k(k &gt; 2) sub-networks, and the qth subnetwork has n q agents with the Laplacian matrix L q , q = 1, 2, . . . , k. Then, the weights in the same sub-network are positive, and it implies that the agents cooperate with its neighbors in the same sub-network, meanwhile the weights between the agents among different sub-networks are negative, which leads to the fact that the agents compete with its neighbors from different sub-networks. Denote the index sets I 1 = {1, 2, . . . , n 1 }, I 2 = {n 1 + 1, n 1 + 2, . . . , n 1 + n 2 }, . . . , I k = { k-1 i=1 n i + 1, k-1 i=1 n i + 2, . . . , k i=1 n i }, then the path balance condition in the condensation undirected graph c of the cooperation-competition network is introduced as follows.</p><p>Definition 2: The condensation undirected graph c is path balance if the lengths of all the paths between π i and π j have the same parity for each pair of distinct vertexes ( π i , π j ).</p><p>Then, the following theorem provides some sufficient condition about the decomposing of the cooperation-competition network.</p><p>Theorem 2: Consider a cooperation-competition network is composed of k(k &gt; 2) sub-networks, and assume that the condensation undirected graph c is path balance, then the cooperation-competition network can be finally divided into two sub-networks with competition relationship between them.</p><p>Proof: We first denote the indicated number C q of the qth sub-network ( π q in c ), where C q ∈ {0, 1}, q = 1, 2, . . . , k. Then, select a sub-network randomly, and assume that the jth sub-network is selected. Here, the indicated number C j is defined as 1, i.e., C j = 1. Next, consider the neighbors of the jth sub-network, and the indicated numbers of the neighbors are defined as 0, i.e., C i = 0, ∀ πi ∈ N πj , where N πj is the neighbor set of the jth sub-network. Furthermore, for the ith sub-network, the indicated numbers of the neighbors of the ith sub-network are defined as 1, i.e., C p = 1, ∀ πp ∈ N πi , πi ∈ N πj . Note that this process is well-defined. In fact, suppose that this process is not well-defined, then there exist i 0 and p 0 , such that πi 0 ∈ N πj , πp 0 ∈ N πi 0 , and C p 0 can be 1 as well as 0. When C p 0 = 0, one can conclusion that πp 0 ∈ N πj , there exists a path from πj to πp 0 , i.e., (π j , πp 0 ). Meanwhile, if C p 0 = 1, there also exists a path from πj to πp 0 , i.e., (π j , πi 0 ) and (π i 0 , πp 0 ). Obviously, the condensation undirected graph c is not path balance, and this results in a contradiction. Therefore, by induction we can define all the indicated numbers of the k sub-networks, which indicates that the cooperation-competition network can be finally divided into two sub-networks with competition relationship between them. This completes the proof.</p><p>According to Theorem 2, when the condensation undirected graph c is path balance, the vertex set of c can be divided into two categories, denoted by k and k , respectively. Next, in this case, information communication between the agents in the whole network is described by matrix Γ = [Γ ij ], and it has the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">Γ = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ γΛ 1 -βL 1 γB 12 • • • γB 1k γB 21 γΛ 2 -βL 2 • • • γB 2k . . . . . . . . . . . . γB k1 γB k2 • • • γΛ k -βL k ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">Λ i = diag j/ ∈I i a (n 1 +•••+n i-1 +p)j ∈ R n i ×n i , p = 1, 2, .</formula><p>. . , n i , and B ij ∈ R n i ×n j , which represents the informa-  </p><formula xml:id="formula_62">(-1) C 1 1 T n 1 , (-1) C 2 1 T n 2 , . . . , (-1) C k 1 T n k T ∈ R k i=1 n i ,</formula><p>where the parameter C i is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">C i = 0, if i ∈ k 1, if i ∈ k . IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATION</formula><p>In this section, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.</p><p>Consider nine agents in the cooperation-competition network, with their interaction topology presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, and the solid lines represent cooperation relationship between agents, while the dotted lines represent competition relationship between agents.</p><p>According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the mirror graph ¯ of the cooperationcompetition network is strong connected. Then, according to positive weights, one has four sub-networks, i.e., 1 = {1, 2, 4}, 2 = {3}, 3 = {5, 6, 7}, and 4 = {8, 9}. Next, one obtains the condensation undirected graph c presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, which satisfies the path balance condition.</p><p>Therefore, from Theorem 2, one can conclude that the cooperation-competition network finally can be divided into two sub-networks, i.e., 1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}, 2 = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the relationship between them is competitive, which is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is satisfied that a ij = 1 for j ∈ N i + , and a ij = -1 for j ∈ N i -. It should be noted that the topologies of two sub-networks are neither strongly connected nor containing a directed spanning tree. Next, the initial values of x i (t) are randomly chosen from the interval [0, 30], and the initial values of v i (t) are randomly chosen from the interval [0, 50], which satisfies the condition in Theorem 1, i.e., 4 i=1 v i (0) = 9 i=5 v i (0). Moreover, the input of agent i is defined as r 1 (t) = arctg(t), r 2 (t) = arctg(2t), r 3 (t) = arctg(3t), r 4 (t) = arctg(4t), r 5 (t) = -(1/2) (r 1 (t) + r 4 (t)), r 6 (t)= -(1/2) (r 4 (t)+r 3 (t)), r 7 (t)= -(1/2) (r 3 (t) + r 2 (t)), r 8 (t)= -(1/2) (r 1 (t)+r 2 (t)), r 9 (t)= -(1/4)(r 1 (t) + r 2 (t)+ r 3 (t) + r 4 (t)).</p><p>Obviously, the inputs of the agents satisfy the condition in Definition 1, i.e., (1/4) 4 j=1 r j (t) = -(1/5) 9 j=5 r j (t). Due to the fact that lim t→+∞ arctg (at) = (π/2) with a &gt; 0, one has lim t→+∞ (r i (t)r j (t)) = 0 for ∀ i, j ∈ I 1 or ∀ i, j ∈ I 2 . Furthermore, one can conclude that there do not exist δ and ξ &gt; 0 such that the inputs of the agents in the same sub-network satisfies lim t→∞ e ξt (r i (t)r j (t)) = δ. Thus, the multi-agent system (1) asymptotically achieves quasi-reverse couple-group consensus. According to (1) with the parameters α = β = 1, γ = 2, the evolutions of x i (t) in sub-network 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>, respectively. Note that the black solid line represents (1/4) 4 j=1 r j (t) in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, and (1/5) 9 j=5 r j (t) in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, which are the group consensus states, respectively.</p><p>In Theorem 1, the explicit expression of the error level is derived by σ = c Γ /ρ. By some calculations, one obtains c = arctg2arctg(1/2) = 0.6435, Γ = 12.4067, and ρ = 2.8107, thus σ = 2.8405. Furthermore, the error of agent i is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">e i (t) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ x i (t) - 1 4 j∈I 1 r j (t) , i ∈ I 1 x i (t) - 1 5 j∈I 2</formula><p>r j (t) , i ∈ I 2 .</p><p>(28) Then, the evolution of the errors of agent 1 and 5 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. It should be noted that the red dotted lines in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> represent the error level σ = 2.8405, which shows that the estimation of the error level in Theorem 1 is precise. Furthermore, to investigate the reverse couple-group consensus, we choose the inputs of the agents as follows: Then, the inputs of the agents satisfy the condition in Definition 1, i.e., (1/4) 4 j=1 r j (t) = -(1/5) 9 j=5 r j (t). Moreover, it follows that lim t→∞ e 0.5t (r i (t)r j (t)) exists, for ∀ i, j ∈ I 1 or ∀ i, j ∈ I 2 . Therefore, the multi-agent system (1) asymptotically achieves reverse couple-group consensus, and the evolutions of x i (t) in sub-network 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref>, respectively. Note that the black solid line represents (1/4) 4 j=1 r j (t) in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, and (1/5) 9 j=5 r j (t) in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, which are the group consensus states, respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ r 1 (t) = e t -</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has discussed the reverse group consensus problem for the dynamic agents with the inputs in the cooperationcompetition network. In our framework, the whole network can be divided into two sub-networks, and the weights between the agents in the same sub-network were positive, while the weights between the agents among different sub-networks were negative. Firstly, the reverse group consensus has been studied without the in-degree balance condition presented by the majority of the relevant research works. To solve this problem, the concept of the mirror graph of the cooperation-competition network has been defined, and it has been proven that the reverse group consensus problem can be achieved if the mirror graph is strongly connected. Meanwhile, the explicit expression of the error level has been derived, which would be vanished for special classes of the inputs of the agents. It should be emphasized that the sub-network topology is not required to be strongly connected or contains a directed spanning tree, which means that competition relationship plays a positive role in the reverse group consensus of this paper.</p><p>In addition, the decomposing of the cooperation-competition network has been discussed. It has been proven that the cooperation-competition network can be divided into two subnetworks with competition relationship between them if the condensation undirected graph is path balance. Finally, the theoretical results have been verified by representative numerical simulations.</p><p>Future work will focus on solving the reverse group consensus of non-linear multi-agent systems in the presence of delayed information communication, as well as switching network topologies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
