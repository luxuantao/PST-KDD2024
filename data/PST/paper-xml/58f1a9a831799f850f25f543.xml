<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, pattern division multiple access (PDMA), a novel non-orthogonal multiple access scheme, is proposed for 5G radio networks. PDMA pattern defines the mapping of transmitted data to a resource group which can consist of time, frequency, and spatial resources or any combination of these resources. The pattern is introduced to differentiate signals of users sharing the same resources, and the pattern is designed with disparate diversity order and sparsity so that PDMA can take the advantage of joint design of transmitter and receiver to improve system performance while maintaining detection complexity to a reasonable level. System level simulation results show that PDMA can support 6 times simultaneous connections than that of conventional and at least 30% improvement in spectrum efficiency over OFDMA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The fifth generation (5G) needs to support much higher capacity and also provide much larger number of connected users <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. These requirements are rather challenging and it is difficult to satisfy the requirements by using OMA schemes. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has thus been considered as a promising candidate to meet the requirements in connection numbers and system capacity of 5G. Signal of multiple users are superposed and advanced detection algorithm are employed to separate the superposed signal. Theoretically, NOMA is optimal in terms of achieving the capacity boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Actually NOMA has been used in previous wireless systems such as 3G WCDMA system. For example, in the uplink of WCDMA, data symbols are spread by long spreading codes, and multiple users transmit their spread signals on the same frequency and time resources. Since long spreading codes are used, only linear detection algorithm is possible at the receiver due to the complexity of non-linear detection algorithm. As a result, non-orthogonal transmission of this type is demonstrated to be inefficient in terms spectrum efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, a number of NOMA techniques are studied in both industry and academy, such as interleave division multiple access (IDMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, bit division multiplexing (BDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, sparse code multiple access (SCMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and multi-user sharing access (MUSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, etc. With IDMA, different users are distinguished by user-specific interleavers. BDM was first proposed to provide differentiated services for broadcasting system. It extends the multiplexing from symbol level to bit level. Both SCMA and MUSA are based on code domain superposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. To separate users being multiplexed on the same resource, nonlinear detection algorithms such as successive interference cancellation (SIC), maximum a posteriori (MAP) or maximum likelihood (ML) are suggested for receiving. MAP and ML are so complex that it is very difficult to be implemented. SIC receiver reaches a good tradeoff between performance and complexity. However, SIC suffers from the error propagation problem and degrades the performance of NOMA transmission. Specifically, if a user happens to be not correctly detected, the following user will be likely to be erroneously detected, i.e., the performance of SIC relies heavily on the correctness of precedent detected users.</p><p>This paper proposes a novel NOMA scheme based on code pattern, called Pattern Division Multiple Access (PDMA). Joint optimization of transmitting and receiving is considered with SIC amenable pattern design at the transmitter side and SIC based detection at the receiver side. PDMA pattern are designed to offer different order of transmission diversity, so that disparate diversity order between multiple users could be introduced to alleviate the error propagation problem of SIC receiver. PDMA pattern is also required to be sparse to facilitate advanced detection algorithm such as belief propagation <ref type="bibr">(BP)</ref>. Iterations between BP and channel decoding could further boost system performance. PDMA pattern is also extended to include power scaling and phase shifting to harvest additional constellation shaping gain. It is demonstrated by simulation results that PDMA could provide significant gain over OFDMA at both link level and system level.</p><p>The main contribution of this paper is giving a complete reporting about PDMA, including the principle, framework, key technologies, application analysis, and performance evaluation. The rest of this paper is organized as following: In section II, principle of PDMA as well as system model for both uplink and downlink are introduced. In section III, PDMA pattern design at transmitter is discussed, including principle of PDMA pattern design and extension of PDMA pattern matrix. In section IV, detection algorithms at receiver are discussed and analyzed. PDMA application scenarios and system design aspects are described in details in section V. Performance evaluation as results are provided for PDMA and OFDMA in section VI. Finally, in section VII, conclusion remarks are given.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Principle of PDMA</head><p>According to theoretical results of multi-user channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, superposition coding, at a transmitter and SIC at a receiver, are able to achieve capacity boundary of multiple access channels (MAC) or degraded broadcast channels (BC) when T&amp;R are working together. From theoretical perspective it is rational to use SIC to achieve channel capacity, since the packet error rate tends to be zero with the increased code length as long as a user's transmission rate is below the channel capacity. However, in a real system, detection error is inevitable due to various non-ideal conditions, such as, limited code length, channel fading, and glitches, etc.</p><p>For SIC receiver, if a former user's packet is detected erroneously, it is very unlikely that the following users' packet could be detected correctly. This is the so-called error propagation problem. Since multiple users are detected one by one in serial order, the detection order of all users is usually arranged according to their signal strength. That is, the signal of the first detected user is the strongest, the signal of the second detected user is weaker, and so on. For the first detected user, it is recovered directly from the original receiving. While for the following detected users, they are recovered respectively from related cancellation receiving which should cancel those former detected users from the original receiving by user reconstruction. If a user is not correctly detected, its reconstruction is impossible to be correct. In addition, the accuracy of reconstruction also impacts on the performance of following users. For example, based on distorted channel estimation, the reconstructed signal will also be distorted. Even though the user's packet is detected correctly, it still has adverse effect on the following users' detection.</p><p>Error propagation is a crushing blow for multi-user detection and it will deteriorate the performance of SIC based multiuser system. In general, two approaches can be considered to alleviate the error propagation problem. The first is to enhance the reliability of those early-decoded users, either by selecting users with good channel condition or by designing transmission parameters such that the early-decoded users have higher reliability and better channel condition.</p><p>Analytical results of MIMO detection from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> show that the i th detected layers of SIC receiver could achieve diversity order</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N div (i) = N R -N T + i (1)</formula><p>where N R is the receiving antenna number, N T is number of data layers.</p><p>The diversity order increases with the detection order. PDMA design is inspired by above result <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Multiuser channel can be viewed as a virtual MIMO channel and the above result could be generalized to multi-user non-orthogonal transmission. For non-orthogonal transmission employing SIC receiver, diversity order of each user varies with the order of detection. The first detected user has the lowest diversity order, and the last detected user has the highest diversity order. In a fading channel, diversity order affects transmission reliability significantly. Increasing the diversity order typically leads to more reliable transmission. With SIC receiver, the first detected user actually determines the overall detection performance, but unfortunately its diversity order is the lowest. To optimize system performance, it is desirable to have identical pro-detection diversity order for each user.</p><p>Diversity could be obtained from transmission or reception, or from both. Assuming that transmission diversity order of the i th detected user is D T (i), the diversity order after SIC receiver can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N div (i) = D T (i) -K + i (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where K is the number of users. By joint design from transmitter and receiver, PDMA deliberately selects D T (i) so that the diversity order after SIC receiver is as close as possible.</p><p>The definition of transmission diversity means that multiple copies of a signal are transmitted from independent resources to avoid transmission error due to deep fading on one resource. The resources could be time, frequency or spatial resource.</p><p>PDMA maps transmitted data onto a group of resources according to PDMA pattern to realize disparate transmission diversity order. A PDMA pattern defines the mapping from transmitted data to a resource group. A resource group can consist of time resource, frequency resource, spatial resource or any combination of these resources. The number of mapped resources in a group determines the order of transmission diversity. Data of multiple users can be multiplexed onto the same resource group with different PDMA pattern. In this way, non-orthogonal transmission is realized. By assigning PDMA pattern with different diversity order, disparate transmission diversity order among users could be achieved.</p><p>The second approach to alleviate error propagation problem is to adopt more advanced and complex detection algorithm such as ML or MAP. It is anticipated that PDMA with advanced detection algorithm can alleviate error propagation effect to a substantial degree. However, ML or MAP algorithm incurs tremendous detection complexity and it is hard to implement.</p><p>Fortunately, the detection complexity could be reduced significantly by making the PDMA pattern sparse. That is, data are only mapped to a small part of the resources in the resource group. This draws on the idea of sparse coding in low density parity check (LDPC) coding. Sparsity makes it possible to use low complexity BP algorithm to approach the MAP detection. In addition, convergence of BP algorithm could be speed up by disparate transmission diversity of PDMA.</p><p>In summary, PDMA uses PDMA pattern to define sparse mapping from data to a group of resources. PDMA pattern could be represented by a binary vector. The dimension of the vector equals to number of resource in a group. Each element in the vector corresponds to a resource in a resource group. A "1" means that data shall be mapped to the corresponding resource. Actually, number of "1" in the PDMA pattern is defined as its transmission diversity order.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example of resource mapping according to PDMA pattern. Six users are multiplexed on four resource elements (REs). A PDMA pattern is assigned to a user. User1's data are mapped to all four REs in the group, and user2's data are mapped to the first three REs, etc. The order of transmission diversity of the six users is 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, and 1 respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. System Model of Uplink</head><p>Without loss of generality, we assume both transmitter and receiver have single antenna, and an example of uplink PDMA system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>. At the transmitter, a PDMA encoder maps the modulation symbols x k onto resources and generates PDMA modulation vector v k . At the receiver, PDMA multi-user detector is used to detect data of multiplexed users.</p><p>The uplink PDMA system consists of K users and their data are mapped onto N REs by using distinguished PDMA patterns. The PDMA modulation vector v k of user k is obtained by spreading the user's modulation symbol x k according to the PDMA pattern g k :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v k = g k x k , 1 ≤ k ≤ K (3)</formula><p>where g k is an N × 1 binary vector with elements "0" or "1". "1" means that the user's data are mapped to the corresponding RE, otherwise not. The K users' PDMA patterns on N REs construct PDMA pattern matrix G</p><p>[N,K]</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P DM A with the dimensions of N × K: G [N,K] P DM A = [g 1 , g 2 , • • • , g K ] . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>The received signal y at the base station (BS) can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y = K ∑ k=1 diag(h k )v k + n (5)</formula><p>where n represents noise and interference at receiver; h k is the uplink channel response of the k th user; y, n and h k are vectors with length N . diag(h k ) represents a diagonal matrix with elements from h k . Considering ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) can be written in a compact form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">y = Hx + n (6)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x = [x 1 x 2 • • • x K ]</formula><p>T , H is the PDMA equivalent channel response matrix of K users multiplexed on N REs and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">H = H CH • G [N,K] P DM A (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">H CH = [h 1 , h 2 , • • • , h K ]<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where the (n, k) element of H CH is the channel response from the k th user to the base station on the n th RE, and • indicates element-wise product of two matrices. Overload factor is defined as the ratio between the number of users and the number of REs in a resource group. It reflects the multiplexing times of PDMA relative to orthogonal scheme. Taking N = 3, K = 6 as an example, the overload factor is then α = K/N = 200%, which means that PDMA supports two times user compared with OMA. In an example, the PDMA pattern matrix is expressed as G <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P DM A =   1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1  <label>(9)</label></formula><p>The received signal is then given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">  y 1 y 2 y 3   =   h 1,1 h 1,2 0 h 1,4 0 0 h 2,1 0 h 2,3 0 h 2,5 0 0 h 3,2 h 3,3 0 0 h 3,6   H         x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6         +   n 1 n 2 n 3   . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>As a further extension, the constellation mapping and PDMA encoding can be realized by mapping the user's data bits directly to a PDMA modulation vector. This is a joint operation between PDMA encoding and constellation mapping -joint PDMA modulation. Specifically, the candidate set of PDMA modulation vector for user k, called codebook, shall be designed according to the PDMA pattern of user k. The codebook is designed offline and stored in a receiver and transmitter pair. Once the user's PDMA pattern is decided, the associated codebook is therefore determined. Joint PDMA modulation is to choose a PDMA modulation vector from the codebook based on the user's data bits. The vectors in the codebook and the PDMA pattern associated with it have the same sparsity property, i.e., the zero elements appear at the same position. Actually, non-zero elements in the vector is a multi-dimensional constellation in high dimensional space. Joint PDMA modulation completes the PDMA encoding and the constellation mapping simultaneously in high dimensional space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. System Model of Downlink</head><p>In a downlink system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(b), we assume that each user is assigned a PDMA pattern. After PDMA encoding, multiple data streams are superimposed at the base station and transmitted simultaneously. The received signal y k at user k can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where n k represents noise and interference at receiver; h k is the downlink channel response of the k th user; y k , n k and h k are vectors with length N .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PDMA PATTERN DESIGN</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Pattern Matrix Design</head><p>Users multiplexed PDMA patterns, on the same resource group, can construct a PDMA pattern matrix. Each column of the PDMA pattern matrix represents a PDMA pattern. Properties of PDMA pattern matrix such as dimension and level of sparsity contribute both complexity and system performance.</p><p>Given a certain overload factor, there are a number of pattern matrices available, as long as K and N are selected properly. For example, overload factor of 150% could be achieved by a 2 × 3 pattern matrix, i.e., 3 users are multiplexed on two REs. The pattern matrix is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">G [2,3] P DM A = [ 1 1 0 1 0 1 ]</formula><p>and another design for 150% overload is 4 × 6 pattern matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">G [4,6] P DM A =     1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1     .</formula><p>Though both pattern matrices have the same overload factor, G <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> P DM A can achieve better performance while the cost of detection complexity is higher comparing to that of G <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> P DM A . PDMA pattern matrices with different dimensions are able to achieve a given overload factor. With a higher dimension, detection complexity is also higher, and better performance is expected. Given overload factor, dimension of pattern matrix shall be selected to reach a tradeoff between complexity and performance.</p><p>If N is the size of resource group (row number of PDMA pattern matrix), there are 2 N -1 possible binary vectors for a pattern matrix. Assuming K is the column number determined based on overload factor, we can thus choose K patterns out from 2 N -1 candidates to construct PDMA pattern matrix.</p><p>Selection of patterns also gives impacts on performance and complexity:</p><p>1) A pattern with heavier weight (number of "1" elements in the pattern) provides higher diversity order. More reliable data transmission can be anticipated, and detection complexity is also increased. If the system can conduct complex computation, patterns with heavy weight will be preferable; otherwise, light weight patterns have to be selected, aiming at sparse PDMA pattern matrix. 2) According to design principle of PDMA, it is desirable to have different diversity orders in the pattern matrix to alleviate error propagation problem of SIC receiver or fasten convergence of BP receiver. Thus the selected patterns shall have as many different diversity orders as possible.</p><p>3) For patterns with identical diversity order, smaller inner product between the patterns leads to less interference against each other. Small inner product means that the two patterns have less "1" elements in common positions. That is, the number of REs shared by the two patterns is low. Data of two users are multiplexed on only few REs. For example, if two patterns have inner product of 0, the two patterns actually maps data onto a different set of REs, hence there is not interference between the two patterns. For a given diversity order, the selected patterns shall minimize the maximum inner product between any two patterns. Of course this rule is also applied to patterns with different diversity order. The design of pattern matrix shall take overload factor, diversity order and detection complexity into account. A good pattern matrix can reach good trade-off among these aspects.</p><p>The criteria of maximum constellation constrained capacity (CC-Capacity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> can be used to design PDMA pattern matrix especially for uplink application. That is, with the input information on matrix dimension and its row weight, all candidate sets of PDMA pattern matrix are calculated by CC-capacity, then the PDMA pattern matrix with maximum CC-capacity is selected <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">G [N,K] opt = arg max{C(N, K, Ω)∥G [N,K] ⊂ G [N,M ] }, st.∥G [N,K] (:, k)∥ 2 = 1(k = 1, 2, • • • , K), x ∈ Ω K×1 (13)</formula><p>where C(N, K, Ω) denotes CC-Capacity for the parameter N , K and Ω, Ω denotes constellation set, M = 2 N -1 and x is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><p>As an example, assuming the matrix dimension is 4 × 6, the calculation of C(N, K, Ω) is as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">C(4, 6, Ω QP SK ) = I(v 1 ; y) + I(v 2 ; y|v 1 ) + I(v 3 ; y|v 1 , v 2 ) + I(v 4 ; y|v 1 , v 2 , v 3 ) + I(v 5 ; y|v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , v 4 ) + I(v 6 ; y|v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , v 4 , v 5 )<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where I(.) represents the mutual information between the input QPSK symbol and the output of a Gaussian channel, and I(v 2 ; y|v 1 ) denotes the conditional mutual information between v 2 and y with the given value of v 1 , where v k and y are defined in (3) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), respectively.

Assuming a noiseless channel, if the receiver receive -2, or +2 on a RE, then the receiver can infer that the transmitted symbols on the RE is [-1, -1] or [+1, +1]. But if 0 is received, it is impossible for the receiver to recover the transmitted symbols, as both [+1, -1] and [-1, +1] resulting in the same output. Furthermore, if each user adopts QPSK or 16QAM modulation, the combined constellation consists of 9 or 49 constellation points.</p><p>From the above discussions, we can see that the combined constellation has non-uniform distribution and it is no longer one-to-one map between a constellation point and an input user data, i.e., the combination leads to ambiguity.</p><p>To resolve the ambiguity, power scaling and phase shifting can be introduced in PDMA pattern matrix. Specifically, before two users' symbols are mixed, a power scaling factor and a phase shifting factor shall be applied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">v = √ βx 1 e jφ + √ 1 -βx 2 (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>where β is power scaling factor and φ is phase shifting factor.</p><p>As an example, by setting φ = π/4 and β = 0.5, i.e., only phase shifting difference is introduced between users, the combined constellation is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. It can be observed that by adding a phase shifting factor, the ambiguity is resolved. Moreover, the distribution of combined constellation is closer to Gaussian distribution. It is known that, Gaussian 0018-9545 (c) 2016 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. distribution is the capacity maximizing input distribution for AWGN channel. That is, by introducing a phase shifting factor, channel capacity gain is reaped. The gain is also called shaping gain.</p><p>When both power scaling and phase shifting are introduced, the effect is exemplified in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. As expected, the shape of constellation is changed, and it also approaches a Gaussian distribution.</p><p>For PDMA, the power scaling and phase shifting can be naturally incorporated into PDMA pattern matrix. That is, the value "1" in PDMA pattern matrix is substituted with a complex value reflecting both power scaling and phase shifting, forming an extended PDMA pattern matrix.

DETECTION ALGORITHM AT RECEIVER Detection algorithm at receiver is the key to reap performance gain of PDMA in uplink and downlink. This section is dedicated to the details of the three algorithms suitable for PDMA: SIC, BP, and BP-IDD. By arranging diversity order of PDMA patterns, error propagation problem of SIC receiver could be alleviated to certain extent. Sparsity of PDMA pattern greatly reduces the complexity of BP and BP-IDD algorithm, making them suitable for PDMA system. In addition, PDMA pattern could be designed to speed up convergence of BP and BP-IDD. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. SIC</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, the basic idea of SIC receiver is to reconstruct a user's signal and then subtract it from the received signal. The construction could be carried out either at symbol level or codeword level. For the symbol level SIC (SL-SIC), the construction is made from the demodulated symbols. Instead, the codeword level SIC (CW-SIC) is based on signal construction from decoded data bits. As channel decoding is able to correct most errors, CW-SIC is expected to perform better than SL-SIC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. BP-IDD</head><p>The basic principle of BP based iterative detection and decoding (BP-IDD) algorithm is that the decoded bit-LLR is fed back from Turbo decoder and converted to symbol-LLR as the a priori information of the BP detector. There are two iterative processes in the BP-IDD receiver: inner iteration processing of BP detector and outer iteration processing between BP detector and Turbo decoder. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, besides a traditional BP multi-user detector, the BP-IDD receiver includes multiple parallel iterative processes, each of which is composed by modules of deinterleaver, Turbo decoder and interleaver. Here soft information is transferred between the multi-user detector and the Turbo decoder, in the form of log-likelihood ratio (LLR).</p><p>A factor graph of BP-IDD algorithm based on PDMA pattern matrix G <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> P DM A is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>.

The connection between UND and VND shall satisfy certain condition imposed by channel encoding. According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>, the iterative process between UND and CND, described in the previous section BP detection, is called inner iteration, and the iterative process between UND and VND is named outer iteration.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. PDMA IN 5G SYSTEM</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Application Scenarios</head><p>PDMA can be applied in typical scenarios of 5G, for example, in enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) or massive machine type communication (MTC).</p><p>In eMBB scenario, the main challenge is to enhance the transmission rate. Massive MIMO, ultra dense networking, and high frequency communication are candidate technologies. PDMA can be used in conjunction with these technologies.</p><p>In massive MTC scenario, a base station needs to provide connection to a huge number of low cost terminals. The main challenge for massive MTC scenario is how to effectively deal with massive connection with power constraint.</p><p>In 4G LTE system, to transmit data, a user shall first issue scheduling request (SR) on periodically occurred resources which is configured by base station. Base station then makes scheduling decisions and sends uplink grant to the user indicating the resources on which the user can transmit data. Generally, the procedure may take 10ms or more. For some massive MTC application, such a long latency is unacceptable. Moreover, the uplink grant is carried by downlink control signaling, and with massive number of connections the downlink control channel may become a bottleneck. In such situation, grant-free transmission is a viable option.</p><p>By means of grant-free transmission, a user autonomously selects resource for transmission without SR and scheduling of base station. To avoid interfering with other traffic scheduled by base station, resource for grant-free transmission shall be confined within a certain set of resources. The resource set is called resource pool. For orthogonal transmission, resource pool consists of resource in time and frequency domains. A user selects a resource from the pool for transmission.</p><p>As there is no coordination between users sharing the same resource pool, it is likely that two users select the same resource. When a collision happens, it may lead to failure in detection. The probability of collision is proportional to the number of users sharing the resource pool, and is inverse proportional to the number of resources in the pool. That is, enlarging the resource pool could reduce collision probability.</p><p>As a non-orthogonal transmission scheme, PDMA could naturally be incorporated into grant-free transmission to reduce the collision probability. That is, PDMA provides another dimension for resource sharing -PDMA pattern. A traditional resource pool could be extended to include PDMA pattern. Specifically, each resource group in the pool is associated with a PDMA pattern matrix. A UE selects a time-frequency resource as well as a PDMA pattern from the pattern matrix for transmission. Even though two users may select the same time-frequency resource, as long as their PDMA patterns are different, the receiver is able to decode the two users data successfully.</p><p>The resource pool is α -1 times larger than a traditional resource pool where α is the overload factor of the PDMA pattern matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. System Design Aspects</head><p>To enable PDMA in practice, a number of aspects in system design shall be considered.</p><p>Air interface and process design PDMA enables large number of users to transmit on the same resource, especially when PDMA is used jointly with massive MIMO. The need for reference signal will be multiplied accordingly. Reference signal shall be designed carefully to meet the requirements of detecting PDMA signal and keeping the overhead incurs by the reference signal to a reasonable level.</p><p>Multi-user transmission of PDMA also leads to demanding requirements on control channel, as each users data shall be accompanied by a control channel to provide necessary information for detection. Techniques such as multi-subframe scheduling, group control signal design and the control signaling content design could serve as a starting point to cope with the problem. Link adaptation for downlink PDMA is based on user of the channel quality information (CQI). However, the multi-user pairing nature of PDMA makes it difficult for a user to predict CQI without knowing its paring users and their PDMA patterns. Power domain optimization may further complicate the problem, as the user will not know what the transmission power is going to be before making the scheduling decision. A flexible CQI calculating and reporting mechanism is needed.</p><p>As discussed above, the grant-free transmission is able to reduce data latency and to control overhead. Though by introduction of PDMA, a resource pool could be extended, it is still possible that two users collide on the same resource and PDMA pattern especially when the system is heavy loaded. To facilitate grant-free transmission, resource selection method and mechanism to resolve conflicts play a fundamental role.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Radio resource management</head><p>Traditionally, the radio resource management deals with the allocations of time, frequency, and spatial resources to make full use of the wireless resources. PDMA introduces another dimension -PDMA pattern. The optimization problem becomes really challenging, as more optimization variables are involved. Low complexity radio resource management algorithm, that could achieve near-optimal performance, is worthy to seek.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION A. Comparison of PDMA and OMA</head><p>Taking LTE orthogonal system as a reference, uplink and downlink performances of PDMA are evaluated and results are provided in this section. The assumptions of the link-level simulations are shown in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, and the results are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref>. The system-level simulation assumptions are shown in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>, and the simulation results are provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref> shows the total spectrum efficiency (SE) of uplink PDMA under the overload factors of 150%, 200%, and 300% as well as SE of OFDMA. For fair comparison, same number of source bits is assumed for PDMA and OFDMA. For the given overload factors of 150%, 200% and 300%, SE gains of 50%, 100% and 200% can be achieved by PDMA over OFDMA when SNR is high enough.</p><p>In a downlink system, the SNR differences between users have tremendous influence on the performance of PDMA.  The performance gain of PDMA over OFDMA gets more remarkable when the difference gets larger. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref>, when the SNR difference of two users is 12dB, the SE gain is 14% when the SNR is -4dB; reaches the maximum of 50% when SNR is 0dB; and vanishes when the SNR is higher PDMA uplink system performance (Supported packet arrival rate when packet drop rate = 1%) 0.17 than 10dB.</p><p>The uplink grant-free OFDMA and PDMA transmissions are evaluated under traffics with small burst packet and the latency is required to be not more than 1ms. Gain of 500% in terms of the number of supported users under the given system packet drop rate of 1% is observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref>. The gain comes from two facts. First, PDMA provides a larger resource pool than OFDMA does, so that the collision probability of PDMA is lower than that of OFDMA. Second, the BP-IDD employed by PDMA is more capable of dealing with interference when collision occurs.</p><p>From the results of downlink PDMA shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>, PDMA can get about 30% gain compared with OFDMA in terms of both SE at cell edge and cell average SE. The gain increases with the user number in a cell increasing, because with more users it is easier to find suitable users for pairing in PDMA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Comparison of Different Pattern Matrix</head><p>Taking overload factor 150% and 200% as examples, uplink performances of PDMA with different pattern matrices are provided in this section. For the given pattern matrix 4 × 6, 3 × 6 and 4 × 8 described in section III.A, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> shows their performance comparison.  As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>, higher row weight (d f ) can get better performance. For PDMA pattern matrix 4×6, row weight d f = 3 has 1dB gain compared with row weight d f = 2. In addition, PDMA pattern matrix with higher dimension can get better performance. For the same overload 200%, pattern matrix 4×8 has 0.8dB gain compared with pattern matrix 3 × 6. However, a higher row weight or a higher dimension in construction PDMA pattern matrix means a higher complexity in detection. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref> gives a comparison of the computation complexity about these pattern For the same dimension 4 × 6, the complexity of pattern matrix with row weight d f = 3 is 6 times of pattern matrix with row weight d f = 2. For the same overload 200%, the complexity of pattern matrix 4 × 8 is 1.33 times of pattern matrix 3 × 6. Therefore, a tradeoff between performance and complexity should be considered in pattern matrix design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Comparison of Different Receivers</head><p>For those receivers described in section IV, uplink performances of PDMA with BP or BP-IDD receivers are compared, and the results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>. Also, downlink performances of PDMA with BP or SIC are compared, and   the results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">15</ref>. Table <ref type="table">V</ref> gives comparisons of the computation complexity.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>, BP-IDD receiver has gain compared with BP receiver. Especially, the gain is higher with overload increasing, e.g., the gain is 0.8dB for overload 150% with pattern matrix 2 ×3, and the gain is 1.6 dB for overload 300% with pattern matrix 4×12. This is because that the performance of BP algorithm converges more slowly for overload factor of 300% compared with 150% and the frequency diversity degree is higher for 300% than 150%. Whereas, from computation complexity, addition in BP-IDD receiver is 3 times of that in BP receiver.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">15</ref>, BP receiver has a gain of 2 dB compared with SIC receiver in downlink where MCS of the near user and far user is QPSK 1/2, and power factor is 0.2 and 0.8. Whereas, the computation complexity of BP receiver is about 1.67 and 15 times higher than SIC receiver in multiplication and addition, respectively VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS Pattern division multiple access (PDMA) has been incorporated into ITU-R Report "Future technology trends of terrestrial IMT systems" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> by ITU organization since 2014. It is a novel NOMA scheme based on successive interference cancellation (SIC) amenable multiple access (SAMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. To achieve an integral optimization for multiuser communication system, PDMA considers joint design of transmitting and receiving, with SIC amenable pattern design at the transmitter and SIC based multi-user detection at the receiver.</p><p>This paper provides a whole picture of PDMA, including system model, PDMA pattern design, PDMA detection algorithm, application in 5G system, and performance evaluation. System-level simulation results show that PDMA can support up to 6 times connected users and at least 30% improvement in spectrum efficiency over OFDMA. Further research directions of PDMA include combination of PDMA encoding and modulation, low complexity detection algorithm, and combining with multiple antennas, etc.</p><p>At present, with the support of the 863 project (Item No.2015AA01A709) by Chinese government, PDMA testbed is being developed including multiple transmitters and multiple receivers. The PDMA field tests in both eMBB scenario and massive MTC scenario are expected in 2016.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
