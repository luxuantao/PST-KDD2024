<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Index Terms-Mobility modeling, random waypoint model, ad hoc networking, connectivity. A NALYSIS of wireless systems, either via simulation or analytical modeling, often requires that the effect of node (or user) mobility on system performance can be modeled. The construction and use of mobility models based on the actual, say, measured characteristics of mobile nodes is difficult. Instead, one often uses elementary synthetic mobility models, which still capture the essential impact of mobility on the performance measure under study. The advantage of using synthetic models is that they can be more easily treated in analysis or implemented in simulations.</p><p>The most widely used synthetic mobility model is the Random Waypoint model (RWP), which was originally proposed for studying the performance of ad hoc routing protocols by Johnson and Maltz <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In this model, a mobile node moves in a convex domain along a zigzag path, where each of the straight line segments is called a leg. At each turning point the node chooses a new destination randomly and then moves toward the destination at a constant speed, which is drawn independently from a given speed distribution at each turning point. The node may also remain stationary for a random pause time before starting its movement towards the next destination.</p><p>Analytical performance evaluation of ad hoc networks requires analyzing the properties of the mobility models. For example, one important intrinsic property of any mobility model is the distribution of the node location (or shortly the node distribution), which may be far from uniform. On the other hand, the uniform distribution is commonly assumed in many performance studies, for example in studies on ad hoc network capacity (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) and connectivity properties of random networks (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). Thus, knowledge of the actual node distribution is often needed in order to study the impact of mobility on the performance measure of interest.</p><p>In this paper, we derive an explicit expression for the node distribution of RWP in an arbitrary convex domain and demonstrate the use of the result for various shapes of the domain. Accurate polynomial approximations for the density function are derived for a regular triangle, square, and hexagon. We comment on the relation of our results to other related work separately in Section 1.1. Additionally, a generalized RWP model is considered, where the waypoints may have an arbitrary distribution, for which a general expression for the node distribution is derived. As a special case of this, we further study a variant of the RWP model, named as RWPB, where the waypoints are located on the perimeter of the area. The motivation for introducing and analyzing the RWPB model is that, whereas the RWP model yields a distribution that concentrates more probability mass near the center of the domain, the RWPB model gives a distribution with more probability mass near the edges than in the center. Hence, these models serve as two elementary mobility models with fundamentally different spatial characteristics, and any practical networking mechanism should be robust with respect to different mobility patterns. As an application of our results, we consider the connectivity properties of ad hoc networks. In particular, we compare the impact of nodes moving according to either RWP or RWPB against the assumption of nodes being uniformly distributed in the area. Knowledge of the exact node distribution allows the derivation of accurate polynomial approximations. Such approximations facilitate numerical computations in another application, where we study the impact of node mobility on the traffic load distribution in ad hoc networks with shortest path routing.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the traditional RWP model together with some of the notation. The RWP model is analyzed in Section 3, where analytic expressions for the node distribution and its polynomial approximations are derived and illustrated for several geometries. Correspondingly, the results for the generalized RWP model with an arbitrary waypoint distribution are given in Section 4. Applications of our results are given in Section 5. Section 6 contains our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work and Our Contribution</head><p>The RWP model and its spatial properties have been analyzed recently in a number of other papers. The observation that the initial definition of the speed distribution (i.e., the uniform distribution in the range ½0; v max ) was indeed ill-defined was made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Since then the same observations have been made in several other papers as well, see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The impact of the speed distribution on simulations is further discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for more general mobility models.</p><p>Concerning the derivation of the node distribution, results for some special shapes of the movement region have been given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Navidi and Camp <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> basically give the definition of the node distribution in a rectangular area, resulting in a four-dimensional integral over all possible locations of the starting and ending points. Using our approach, we are able to simplify this expression considerably (in an arbitrary convex domain). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Bettstetter et al. derive simple explicit results for the node distribution in circular and rectangular regions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> contains new results on temporal properties of RWP and repeats the results on the node distribution from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), but the derivations have been performed using approximations at certain steps resulting in slight inaccuracy in the results (as indicated in our numerical examples).</p><p>Our analysis is similar to that of Bettstetter et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, we complete the analysis without using approximations or a special shape for the region and derive an explicit analytical expression for the node distribution in an arbitrary convex region. The point at which our analysis differs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is indicated in our derivation in Section 3. As mentioned earlier, the direct application of the definition for the node distribution results in a four-dimensional integral. We are able to simplify the expression to a onedimensional integral, which gives the distribution up to a normalization constant. The evaluation of the normalization constant requires integration of the density expression over the considered region. Our result was first given in report form in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A generalization of this result to IR n has been published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>We also give results on the mean length of a leg, which can be obtained in our case in two ways. The mean length of a leg can be related to the normalization constant. On the other hand, it can be expressed as a four-dimensional integral, which we reduce to a two-dimensional one (in the appendix). Note that the results for the mean leg length can be also found in the literature (see, e.g., "line picking" problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>).</p><p>More recently, independent of our work, the theory of Palm calculus has been applied for analyzing RWP in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The main result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is that the stationary node distribution is independent of the velocity distribution. This issue is also discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and we take this property established. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a much more general class of mobility models, of which RWP is a special case, is treated formally using Palm calculus. The paper discusses both transient and time stationary distributions of these processes, and the aim is to develop simulation methods, where the process can be initialized according to the stationary state of the system, thus avoiding any special transient handling. However, the formal results on the distributions cannot be readily applied for obtaining explicit expressions of the node distribution, e.g., for RWP that can be numerically evaluated easily.</p><p>Also, we note that the properties of the RWP process are in some sense related to the theory of Poisson line processes studied in the field of stochastic geometry, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Typically, the processes in stochastic geometry are treated on an infinite plane, but in RWP the region of motion is bounded. To the best of our knowledge, results as explicit as ours are not available from this field of science either.</p><p>We additionally derive the node distribution for the RWP model in IR 2 with the generalization that the waypoint distribution can be arbitrary (instead of the uniform distribution). As a special case of that, we consider a modified RWP process introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, where the waypoints are always on the perimeter of the region. As mentioned earlier, this model, referred to as the RWP on border (RWPB), has a node distribution fundamentally different from the node distribution of RWP. The RWPB model has been analyzed using simulations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Again, the model fits in the framework as studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, but to utilize the results requires Palm calculus. We derive our result using the same method as for RWP giving a simple explicit numerically integrable expression for the node distribution.</p><p>An application of the analysis presented in this paper is the use of the results for the derivation of more efficient simulation methods. Yoon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> have illustrated how, for a class of mobility models, the transient time can be substantially shortened by sampling the initial node speed from the known stationary node speed distribution. However, in a simulation of any mobility model, just initializing the speed appropriately still leaves the transient corresponding to the time until the node location obeys its stationary distribution. For the RWP model, Navidi and Camp <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have utilized their theoretical results for deriving algorithms with which the entire state (speed and location) of the RWP model (with and without pause times) can be initialized according to its stationary state. Le Boudec and Vojnovi c c <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> refer to this way of initialization as perfect simulation, and they show how this can be achieved for a large class of simulation models by applying the insights from using Palm calculus. Our results can be used to facilitate the generation of samples from the stationary node distribution, and we comment on this briefly later on.</p><p>As an application of our results with impact on ad hoc networking, we consider connectivity properties of ad hoc networks. More specifically, we concentrate on the probability that a given network of n nodes, each moving according to RWP (or RWPB), is connected. As a part of our earlier work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we have derived a very accurate approximation for connectivity under the assumption of nodes moving according to the RWP model. However, in this paper we use those results to compare connectivity properties of RWP and RWPB. Our approach to approximate the connectivity is similar to the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, with the distinction that our results have been obtained using exact results for the node distribution. Finally, both our approximation and the one used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> are motivated by the theoretical results found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Another networking application of our analytical results concerns evaluating the traffic load distribution in ad hoc networks. An analytical model for this has been given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, where it has been assumed that the node distribution obeys a uniform distribution. We study how nodes moving according to the RWP model affect the traffic load distribution using a similar approach as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RANDOM WAYPOINT MOBILITY MODEL</head><p>The process representing the movement of a node within a convex area A &amp; IR 2 according to the RWP model can be described as follows. Initially, the node is placed at the point P 1 chosen from a uniform distribution over A. Then, a destination point (also called waypoint) P 2 is chosen from a uniform distribution over A and the node moves along a straight line from P 1 to P 2 with constant velocity V 1 drawn independently of the location from a velocity distribution with pdf f V ðvÞ. Once the node reaches P 2 , a new destination point, P 3 , is drawn independently from a uniform distribution over A and velocity V 2 is drawn from f V ðvÞ independently of the location and V 1 . The node again moves at constant velocity V 2 to the point P 3 , and the process repeats. Formally, the RWP process is defined as an infinite sequence of triples <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ðP 0 ; P 1 ; V 1 Þ; ðP 1 ; P 2 ; V 2 Þ; ðP 2 ; P 3 ; V 3 Þ; . . .<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>This is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Thus, the path of a node consists of straight line segments, called legs, defined by a sequence of independently and uniformly distributed waypoints, fP i g, in a convex set A &amp; IR 2 . Furthermore, on each leg ðP iÀ1 ; P i Þ the node velocity V i is an i.i.d. random variable independent of the node location having the pdf f V ðvÞ. It is also possible to extend the model by defining random pause times (i.i.d. random variables) at the waypoints. The influence of this generalization on the node distribution can be analyzed in a rather straight forward manner as the process consists of two independent and alternating modes, mobile and stagnant <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Next, we introduce some notation used throughout our analysis of RWP. Let the random variable X denote the location of a waypoint P . The waypoints are uniformly and independently distributed over A, i.e., the probability density function (pdf) of X is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">gðrÞ ¼ 1 A ; r 2 A; 0; otherwise; 8 &gt; &lt; &gt; :</formula><p>where A denotes the area of the set A &amp; IR 2 . We denote this uniform distribution by UðAÞ and write X $ UðAÞ. The random variable representing the location of the node at an arbitrary point of time is denoted by R and its pdf by fðrÞ.</p><p>Note that two consecutive legs in the RWP process (see (1)) share a common waypoint and thus are not independent. However, many properties of the RWP process can be analyzed by studying the corresponding independent leg process, where the legs are, as the name suggests, independent and identically distributed. Formally, for a given RWP process the corresponding independent leg process can be obtained by considering, e.g., every second leg (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ðP 0 ; P 1 ; V 1 Þ; ðP 2 ; P 3 ; V 3 Þ; ðP 4 ; P 5 ; V 5 Þ; . . .<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>For example, the stationary node distributions of both processes are the same.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the velocities were taken from a uniform distribution in the range ½v min ; v max , but any distribution can be used (e.g., the beta distribution and a discrete distribution have been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). Given the pdf f V ðvÞ from which the velocities at the waypoints are drawn, the stationary distribution of the velocity for a node moving according to the RWP model is given by ð1=vÞf V ðvÞ up to a normalization constant. This is because the time spent on a leg is proportional to 1=v, and V and X are independent. From this, it is also obvious that for f V ðvÞ ¼ U½v min ; v max the stationary distribution is only defined for v min &gt; 0. Hence, letting v min ¼ 0 implies that stationarity is never reached or, more precisely, in the stationary state all the nodes are stopped, as pointed out by Yoon et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and later by others in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Finally, note that the stationary distribution of the location of a node and the stationary node velocity distribution are independent of each other, as has been formally shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SPATIAL NODE DISTRIBUTION wITH ARBITRARY WAYPOINTS</head><p>In this section, the traditional RWP model is considered. General expressions for the node distribution and the mean length of a leg are derived. The results are then illustrated for the RWP process in some regular geometries, for which also accurate polynomial approximations are derived.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Approach and Derivation</head><p>Consider a convex area A and a node moving within this area at a speed V according to the RWP from waypoint P 1 at r 1 to waypoint P 2 at r 2 . Our aim is to derive the probability density fðrÞ giving the probability per unit area of finding the node at r. Similarly, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we consider a small area element dA located at r. Let P 1 and P 2 be two consecutive points on the path. Denote by ' the length of leg P 1 P 2 , ' ¼ jP 1 P 2 j, and by ' \ dA the length of the leg inside a small area element dA. The desired probability density is the expected proportion of time spent in dA, divided by dA (probability per unit area),</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">fðrÞ ¼ E½ð' \ dAÞ=V E½'=V Á dA ¼ 1 E½' E½' \ dA dA ;</formula><p>i.e., as the speed on each leg is drawn independently of the waypoints, the probability density equals the ratio of expected length of the leg segment inside dA to the mean leg length E½'. The expectation in the numerator is calculated by conditioning on the position r 1 of the point P 1 ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E½' \ dA ¼ 1 A Z A E½' \ dA j P 1 ¼ r 1 d 2 r 1 :</formula><p>The conditional expectation (expectation over all possible locations of P 2 ) is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E½' \ dA j r 1 ¼ 1 A Z A ð'ðr 1 ; r 2 Þ \ dAÞ d 2 r 2 ;</formula><p>where we have made it explicit that the line segment ' is from r 1 to r 2 . We note that these equations are already given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where the authors use an approximation for E½' \ dA j r 1 . However, no approximation is necessary at this point. Now, refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, and where the shape of the area dA has been chosen in a special way to facilitate the derivation. (It is easy to see that the result is the same irrespective of the shape of dA.) The intersection of 'ðr 1 ; r 2 Þ and dA is Á when r 2 is in the shaded area and 0 otherwise. So, the integral equals Á times the shaded area and we have with the notation of the figure,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E½' \ dA j r 1 ¼ 1 A Á 1 2 d ððr þ a 1 Þ 2 À r 2 Þ ¼ dA 2 A r ð2 r a 1 þ a 2 1 Þ; since dA ¼ Á r d. Substitution into the original definition gives, fðrÞ ¼ 1 E½'A 2 Z A 2 r a 1 þ a 2 1 2 r d 2 r 1 ¼ 1 E½'A 2 Z 2 0 d Z a2 0 r a 1 þ 1 2 a 2 1 dr;</formula><p>where, in the second form, polar coordinates have been used, d 2 r 1 ¼ r dr d, and a 2 denotes the distance to the boundary in the opposite direction, þ , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>The radial integral can be evaluated explicitly, yielding the final result</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">fðrÞ ¼ 1 E½'A 2 Z 2 0 1 2 a 1 a 2 ða 1 þ a 2 Þ d ¼ 1 E½'A 2 Z 0 a 1 a 2 ða 1 þ a 2 Þ d;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where both a 1 and a 2 are functions of r and , a 1 ¼ a 1 ðr; Þ and a 2 ¼ a 2 ðr; Þ. The latter form follows because a 2 ðr; Þ ¼ a 1 ðr; þ Þ, i.e., adding to interchanges the roles of a 1 and a 2 . The integration turns "the propeller" one turn around, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. For future purposes, we denote the latter integral in (3) by hðrÞ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">hðrÞ ¼ Z 0 a 1 a 2 ða 1 þ a 2 Þ d:<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>Because fðrÞ is a distribution integrating to unity,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R A fðrÞ d 2 r ¼ 1, we immediately obtain E½' ¼ 1 A 2 Z A hðrÞ d 2 r:<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>An alternative expression for E½' is given in Appendix A.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Example: Polynomial Approximations for Regular Polygons</head><p>First, we note that it is straightforward to evaluate (3) numerically for any convex polygon. Here, our aim is to derive reasonably accurate polynomial approximations for the exact pdf of the node location in the regular polygons illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The center of each polygon is chosen so that the polygon is symmetrical relative to the x-axis (and possibly to the y-axis also) and the distance from the center to the base is equal to 1. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> contains the numerical values for the mean leg length E½' and the normalization constant C for regular triangle, square, and hexagon. Polynomial approximations can be motivated by different reasons. For one, they can be used to generate efficiently samples from the stationary node distribution by using the rejection method. The speed improvement over the existing algorithms (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) is roughly by a factor of two. Second, computation of performance quantities based on the stationary node distribution requires integration over all locations, which can be a rather tedious task if the integrand itself is an integral expression. A similar application for     polynomial approximations with nonzero even coefficients is discussed later in Section 5.2.</p><p>To clarify our approach, let us first consider a square having corner points at ðÀ1; À1Þ, ð1; À1Þ, ð1; 1Þ, and ðÀ1; 1Þ. As already mentioned, by choosing the corner points this way the resulting pdf is symmetric relative to both axes and diagonals. It turns out that polynomials of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">X i;j a ij ðx 2 þ y 2 Þ i ðx 2 y 2 Þ j ;</formula><p>exhibit this symmetry. Furthermore, we know that the pdf is zero at the border of the domain and, hence, the respective lines,</p><p>x AE 1 ¼ 0 and y AE 1 ¼ 0; should be factors in the polynomial approximation. The symmetry and the boundary requirements lead us to consider polynomials of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">P 4 ðx; yÞ ¼ ð1 À x 2 Þð1 À y 2 Þ X i;j a ij ðx 2 þ y 2 Þ i ðxyÞ 2j :</formula><p>Similarly, for a (regular) triangle and hexagon, the suitable polynomials must be even functions of x and invariant under rotations by 120 and 60 for a triangle and hexagon, respectively. Hence,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">P 3 ðx; yÞ ¼ ð1 þ yÞðð2 À yÞ 2 À 3x 2 Þ Á X i;j a ij ðx 2 þ y 2 Þ i ðy ð3x 2 À y 2 ÞÞ j ; P 6 ðx; yÞ ¼ ð1 À y 2 Þððy þ 2Þ 2 À 3x 2 Þððy À 2Þ 2 À 3x 2 Þ Á X i;j a ij ðx 2 þ y 2 Þ i ðy ð3x 2 À y 2 ÞÞ 2j :</formula><p>First, we fix the degree of the polynomial, i.e., decide on a finite set of coefficients a ij to be determined. As a fitting criterion we use the mean square error (MSE) given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">9</ref>). To ease the computational burden, we exploit the symmetry and evaluate the MSE integral only over the shadowed areas in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> contains the numerically obtained coefficients. In all cases the obtained polynomial approximation differs from the exact pdf mainly near the corners, where the maximum absolute error is in the range of 0:01 À 0:02. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> illustrates the results for the regular triangle. The fitted polynomial consists of five terms resulting in a polynomial of the eighth degree. The MSE is about 0:004, and the maximum absolute error is about 0:014.</p><p>For the square, we have chosen to fit a polynomial of the sixth degree. The resulting approximation has a MSE of about 1:4 Á 10 À3 and a maximum absolute error of about 0:010 which is obtained near the corners. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Bettstetter et al. give an approximation, which is almost as accurate as ours. It turns out that their approximation has a MSE of about 7:1 Á 10 À3 and a maximum absolute error of about 0:012, which is obtained in the middle of the region. However, the approximation proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> has two deficiencies. First, it is defined piecewise in eight symmetrical areas and is not completely smooth across the borders of those areas. Second, the expression is rather complex when compared to our polynomial. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> illustrates the exact pdf (solid line), our polynomial approximation (dotted line), and the approximation by Bettstetter et al. (dashed line). Note that, the spatial pdf of the node location, e.g., in an arbitrary rectangle with sides a and b, cannot be obtained by simple scaling of the pdf of a square. Hence, if one is considering an arbitrary rectangle, one should evaluate (3) using appropriate expressions for a 1 (and a 2 ).</p><p>Finally, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> contains the results for a regular hexagon area. The resulting pdf is already rather close to the pdf in a unit disk. The fitted polynomial was chosen to consist of terms up to the ninth degree, which yields a satisfactory approximation with a MSE of about 0.0012 and a maximum absolute error of about 0.016.   </p></div>

Assume that there are k line segments on the border B with lengths B i , i ¼ 1; . . . ; k, while the total length of the border is B. There is clearly a strictly positive probability that two consecutive waypoints reside on the same line segment and, consequently, that the node is on the border, i.e., R 2 B. Thus, the system can be seen to be in two alternating states: "border mode" and "interior mode." The border mode corresponds to legs along some straight line segment and the interior mode corresponds to legs passing through the area. In particular, let p i denote the probability that an arbitrary leg occurs on line segment i, p i ¼ Pftwo consecutive waypoints on line segment ig</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">¼ B i B 2 ;</formula><p>and p 0 the probability that a transition belongs to interior mode, for which we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">p 0 ¼ 1 À X k i¼1 p i :</formula><p>As the arriving point and the departing point on any line segment i are uniformly distributed, the two modes (interior/border) can be treated separately.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Connectivity in Ad Hoc Networks</head><p>Connectivity properties are an essential reliability performance characteristic of ad hoc networks because of the use of multihop paths for communication. As part of earlier work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we studied a network consisting of n nodes moving according to RWP within the unit circle and we have derived a very accurate approximation for the probability that the network is k-connected, i.e., that there are at least k node disjoint paths in the network. Here, we apply Approximation 1 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to compare the connectivity properties of RWP and RWPB, which have very different spatial properties.</p><p>Below, we restate the approach used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for the special case of 1-connectivity (i.e., probability that all nodes can reach all other nodes) since we will only concentrate on that. We consider n nodes moving within the unit disk. To define when two nodes are directly connected, it is assumed that the coverage area of each node is circular with a radius of d and is denoted by B d ðrÞ, and that two nodes can hear each other's transmissions if they are within a distance of d from each other (i.e., we assume the so-called Boolean network model). Also, we denote by pðr; dÞ the probability that a given node is within B d ðrÞ, where we emphasize that this probability depends only on the distance r ¼ jrj from the center. We can express pðr; dÞ as pðr; dÞ ¼ Z x2BdðrÞ fðjxjÞ dA; where x denotes the vector for the location of a point inside B d ðrÞ, and fðÁÞ is the density of the RWP or RWPB process in a unit disk. The approximation is based on computing the probability that a given node has at least one neighbor, Q n ðdÞ. Since all nodes are independent and the probability that a node is at a distance r from the center equals 2rfðrÞ, Q n ðdÞ is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">Q n ðdÞ ¼ 2 Z 1 0 rfðrÞ 1 À ð1 À pðr; dÞÞ nÀ1 dr;</formula><p>which is an exact result. Motivated by results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, we approximate 1-connectivity by</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">C n ðdÞ ¼ Pfn-node network is 1-connectedg % ðQ n ðdÞÞ n :<label>ð21Þ</label></formula><p>Next, we compare the impact of a uniform node location distribution, the RWP node location distribution, and the RWPB node location distribution on 1-connectivity. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>. The graphs show the probability of the network being 1-connected as a function of the transmission range d of each node for networks with n ¼ 20 (left figure), n ¼ 100, (middle figure), and n ¼ 500 nodes (right figure). In each figure, the result for the RWP model is shown with dashed lines, the result for the RWPB model is shown with solid lines and the result for the uniform distribution is shown with dotted lines. To evaluate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> for RWP, fðrÞ is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, for RWPB, fðrÞ ¼ F 0 ðrÞ=ð2rÞ with F ðrÞ given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, and for the uniform distribution fðrÞ ¼ 1=.</p><p>As can be seen from the figure, for a small number of nodes the connectivity properties are better for RWP than RWPB or the uniform distribution. As the number of nodes is increased, the situation changes and RWPB and the uniform distribution yield better connectivity characteristics. Also note that the results for RWPB and the uniform distribution are close to each other, which is understandable as the RWPB node distribution is indeed quite close to uniform except near the border, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13 (right)</ref>.</p><p>It is worth noting that the minimum transmission range required to achieve a high connectivity probability increases slower with the RWP model than with the other two cases, i.e., adding one additional node has a smaller effect to connectivity with the RWP model than with the other two. This behavior is due to the different stationary node distributions and can be explained as follows: Roughly speaking, with the uniform node distribution and the RWPB model, the nodes are evenly distributed and the disconnected node may be located anywhere. Also, an additional node is equally likely to appear in the neighborhood of the disconnected node, thus resolving the disconnected state of the network. With the RWP model the nodes are concentrated near the center of the area and a disconnected node is likely to be near the border. At the same time, an additional node is more likely to be located in the center of the area and, thus, contributes less to the connectivity than is the case with uniformly distributed nodes or the RWPB model.</p></div>

The aim is to determine the pdf for the location of an arbitrary packet. The obtained pdf can then be interpreted as the traffic load distribution in the network with an appropriate scaling. Our initial assumptions and steps are similar to the ones in Pham and Perreau's work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> where the primary motivation has been to compare single-path routing to multipath routing. The comparison between single-path and multipath approaches is further extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> assume a uniform node distribution in a disk. Here, our aim is to apply the RWP formulae to give an estimate for the traffic load in an ad hoc network with single-path routing where the network nodes may not be uniformly distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Let ðrÞ denote the traffic rate experienced by a node located r units away from the center of a unit disk. The expression derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> states that</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">ðrÞ ¼ À 1 ð ÞÁ þ ð1 À r 2 Þ 2 À Á =2 Á ;<label>ð22Þ</label></formula><p>where is the node density, the mean pairwise transmission rate, and some small positive constant reflecting the fact that the routes are not straight lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The first term corresponds to the node's own traffic, as is equal the average number of nodes in a unit disk. The second term corresponds to the relayed traffic, which will be also our focus here. Thus, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, the volume of the relayed traffic is some constant times ð1 À r 2 Þ.</p><p>In our idealized model, we mean by traffic load the amount of (relayed) traffic passing through a differential area element around the node's location. We assume that the number of nodes is large and, hence, a typical route a packet takes consists of several hops and is roughly a straight line segment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Furthermore, we assume that the average time it takes for a packet to travel from one location to another is directly proportional to the distance between the locations. This approximation is justified for straight line routes when the network load is low and queueing delays can be neglected. With these assumptions, the process defining the location of a randomly chosen packet corresponds to the independent leg process (2) where the waypoints, i.e., the locations of the source and the destination node, are drawn from a given distribution. Hence, the stationary distribution of the packet location obeys the stationary node distribution of the corresponding nonuniform RWP process and can be obtained by evaluating <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>Note that obtaining the mean number of packets residing in a given area is a matter of simple scaling. Consider a network with n nodes each with a (constant) transmission range of d. Let denote the mean transmission time of a packet and the average pairwise packet sending rate. Furthermore, let Ã denote the total sending rate of packets, Ã ¼ nðn À 1Þ. On average, the multihop route consists of E½'=d hops and the packet transmission time at each hop is equal to 1=. Thus, for the mean sojourn time of a packet in the network, we have " T T % E½'=ðd Á Þ. By Little's result there are " N N ¼ Ã Á E½'=ðd Á Þ packets under transmission on average. The mean number of packets in a given area is then obtained by multiplying the probability that a single packet moving according to the RWP model is in the area by " N N. As an example, we consider two cases. In the first example, similarly as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the nodes are assumed to be uniformly distributed in a unit disk. In the second example, the nodes are assumed to be moving according to the (uniform) RWP process in a unit disk. When the nodes are uniformly distributed in a unit disk, the stationary distribution of the location of the packet is clearly the same as the node distribution in the (uniform) RWP model, i.e., it is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Note that the polynomial approximation P 1 ðrÞ of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> for the node location in a unit disk is in fact equal to the relayed traffic term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> with an appropriate scaling.</p><p>Next, let us assume that the nodes move according to the (uniform) RWP process in a unit disk. Consequently, their stationary distribution is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Without loss of generality, we can consider point ð0; hÞ, for which the distance to the border in direction is given by aðh</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">; Þ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 À h 2 cos 2 p À h sin :</formula><p>The waypoint distribution, resulting from the underlying uniform RWP process, depends only on the distance from the center of the disk, i.e., with a slight abuse of notation, we have gðrÞ ¼ gðrÞ with r ¼ jrj. It turns out that if the waypoint distribution is a function of r 2 the integrand in (11) (or ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">10</ref>)) simplifies considerably. In particular, in this case, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">fðhÞ ¼ 2 E½' Z 2 0 d Z a 1 0 dr 1 r 1 Á g Ã ðh 2 þ r 2 1 þ 2hr 1 sin Þ Á Z a 2 0 dr 2 g Ã ðh 2 þ r 2 2 À 2hr 2 sin Þ ! ;</formula><p>where g Ã ðr 2 Þ ¼ gðrÞ, a 1 ¼ aðh; Þ, and a 2 ¼ aðh; þ Þ. Substituting to the above expression any polynomial approximation P ðrÞ with nonzero coefficients for the even degree terms yields an integral expression that can be easily evaluated.</p><p>Here, we have chosen to use P 2 ðrÞ from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>, for which the normalization condition gives the mean leg length, E½' % 0:715. For the uniform waypoint distribution, the mean leg length in a unit disk is considerably higher, E½' % 0:905. Note that the mean leg length corresponds to the mean route length in our ad hoc network model. The resulting pdf's are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref>. On the left figure, the (initially) lower curve corresponds to the packet distribution with a uniform network node distribution, and the upper curve corresponds to the packet distribution when the network nodes move according to the (uniform) RWP mobility model. From the figure, it can be seen that with the RWP mobility model probability mass gets more concentrated around the center of the area than in the case of uniform node distribution. Hence, as intuition suggests, the relayed traffic load with nodes moving according to the (uniform) RWP model is considerably higher in the center of the area than is the case with uniformly distributed nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>One of the most widely used mobility models is the RWP model. We have analyzed the spatial distribution of a node moving according to the RWP model. The main result of our paper is the general expression giving the node distribution up to a normalization constant. While the approach shares some similarities with the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we directly consider an arbitrary convex domain and are able to perform the derivations without any approximations. The resulting expression consists of a one-dimensional integral, which is easy to evaluate numerically for any given geometry. The results have been illustrated for several geometries (unit circle, unit square, and hexagon) for which also accurate polynomial approximations have been given. In general, the shape of the node distribution for any geometry is such that the probability mass is concentrated in the center of the area, where the equivalue contours are circular/elliptical, and the density decreases roughly linearly toward the borders with the equivalue contours gradually transforming to curves resembling the geometry of the considered area.</p><p>We have also provided results on a generalization of the basic RWP model where the locations of the waypoints are drawn from an arbitrary distribution. As a special case we have analyzed the RWPB model, where the waypoints are located on the border of the area. If the border contains straight line segments, the distribution of the location of the node is composed of two components corresponding to the border mode and the interior mode. We have given general expressions for both components of the node distribution. An explicit result was derived for the unit circle, having only the interior component. In general, the node distribution in the RWPB model differs from the RWP model by concentrating the probability mass near the border of the area and, eventually, yielding a nonzero probability mass on the border if it contains straight line segments.</p><p>In addition to the application to efficient sample generation, our results can also be applied to study certain performance quantities in a wireless multihop network with mobile users. In this paper, we have given two such applications. As a first application, we have considered connectivity properties of an ad hoc network with nodes moving according to different patterns. The connectivity of the network has been studied, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> where it is assumed that the nodes are either uniformly distributed or move according to (basic) RWP process. The performance quantity of interest has been the probability that a network is (1-)connected, for which accurate approximations have been given. In this paper, we have used the same approach to evaluate the difference between the RWP model, RWPB model, and the assumption that nodes are uniformly distributed in the region. The comparison showed that the connectivity properties of RWP and RWPB yield very different results; connectivity properties under RWP are better than with RWPB or the uniform distribution when the number of nodes is small, and vice versa for a large number of nodes.</p><p>As a second application, the results were used to analyze the traffic load in a dense ad hoc network. Under certain assumptions, we are able to derive an expression for the network load in an ad hoc network with an arbitrary node distribution. As an example, we have studied the traffic load with the node distribution resulting from the RWP model and compared it with the load resulting from the uniform node distribution. The result has been obtained by using the integral expression for spatial node distribution of nonuniform RWP model together with a polynomial approximation for the node pdf according to the uniform RWP model. The results show that due to the mobility the traffic load increases even more in the center of the area than in the case of uniformly located nodes.</p><p>Regarding future work, the RWP mobility model itself perhaps offers limited scope for further extensions and new useful analytical results. However, some of the methods developed in this work may be found useful also in the analysis of more elaborate and realistic mobility models.</p></div>
