<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The model theory of abelian groups was developed by <ref type="bibr">Szmielew ([28]</ref> quantifier elimination and decidability) and Eklof &amp; Fisher <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[4]</ref>, who observed that K1saturated abelian groups are pure injective. Eklof &amp; Fisher related the structure theory of pure injective abelian groups with their model theory.</p><p>The extension of this theory to modules over arbitrary rings became possible after the work of <ref type="bibr">Baur [l]</ref>, Monk <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref>, Fisher <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[6]</ref> and Warfield <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[30]</ref>. Baur proved that -for any fixed module A4 -every formula is equivalent to a boolean combination of positive primitive formulas cp(x,, . . . , x,,) <ref type="bibr">(</ref> finite systems of linear equations with parameters x1, . . . , x,,). The lattice of pp-definable subgroups cp(M) of M gives a lot of information: The elementary type of M is determined by the indices cp/$(M) = (q(M) : $(I@) (~{1,2, . . . , m}), <ref type="bibr">(Monk [14]</ref>). A4 is totally transcendental iff the lattice of pp-definable subgroups of M is well-founded. Therefore totally transcendental modules are 'compact' (Garavaglia and Macintyre <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref>).</p><p>Warfield and Fisher defined and developed the structure theory of pure injective modules. (We use 'compact' for 'pure injective'.) Fisher proved the uniqueness of the representation of a compact module as the pure hull of a direct sum of indecomposable compact (short: 'indecomposable') modules. This was completed by a theorem of Zimmermann &amp; Zimmermann-Huisgen <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[19]</ref>: The endomorphism ring of an indecomposable module is local.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref> Garavaglia showed that a compact module with elementary Krull dimension (i.e. there is no densely ordered chain of pp-definable subgroups) is the pure hull of a direct sum of indecomposables.</p><p>In a sense our paper is a continuation of Garavaglias work. To keep our paper self-contained we reprove the results mentioned above. In Section 1 Baur's and Monk's results are proved. In Section 2 we give the characterization of totally transcendental and superstable modules by means of their lattice of pp-definable subgroups <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref>. In Sections 3 and 6 we present Warfield's theory of smallness, pure hulls (this is also in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[20]</ref>) and prove a slight generalization of a theorem of Fisher:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Every compact module has a unique representation as the pure hull of a direct sum of indecomposables and a compact module without indecomposable factors.</head><p>We begin our study of indecomposable modules in Section 4 with a new proof of the theorem of Zimmermann &amp; Zimmermann-Huisgen (4.3). Our main technical tool is based on this theorem: A syntactical characterization of indecomposable types (4.4): Let a be a non-zero element of the compact module M. There is a minimal direct factor H(a) of M which contains a. (H(a) is unique up to an isomorphism. M = H(a) if M is indecomposable.) We have:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">H(a) is indecomposable ifl for all pp-definable subgroups 4,,(M), &amp;(M) not containing a there is a pp-definable subgroup p(M) s.t. a E(~(M), a$4~~(M)ncp(M)+&amp;(M)ncp(M).</head><p>As one application of 4.4 one can define a quasi compact topology on U, the set of all isomorphism types of indecomposable R-modules. A base for the open sets consists of all (cp/4) ={UsU 1 cp/~,!~(u)&gt; 1). The closed sets are U, ={UEU 1 U is a direct factor of a module elementarily equivalent to M} (4.9, 4.10).</p><p>As a second application one can construct a lot of indecomposables:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.8.">If (p/+(M) &gt; 1, (cpl+) contains an element of IJill.</head><p>Consequences are:</p><p>6.9. Every module is elementarily equivalent to a direct sum of indecomposables. For the computation of the IU it is enough to let the pairs cp, C/J range over a base of neighbourhoods (cp/$) of U. For a suitable choice of bases we obtain (for R =Z) the Szmielew invariants as a special case (cf. 6.12,9.6).</p><p>In Section 5 we determine the indecomposables in several cases: injective indecomposables (5.10) and indecomposable R-modules for a commutative ring R whose localization RQ at maximal ideals Sp are valuation rings (5.2) (proofs are given in the case where all R, are fields or discrete valuation rings.) Here we can restrict ourselves to the case that R is a valuation ring, since for commutative rings R:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Indecomposable R-modules are indecomposable R%-modules for maximal ideals @.</head><p>For Dedekind rings R we give an explicit description of the topological space U in 9.5. For effectively given Dedekind rings (e.g. R = Z) this yields the decidability of the theory of all R-modules (9.7). This is a general theorem:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.4.">Let R be a recursive ring and (cpJ~,$), i EN, an effective enumeration of a base of u = WJjcN. Then the theory of all R-modules is decidable if Cpi/~i(Ui) depends recursively on i, j.</head><p>Similarly we reprove the theorem of Koslov &amp; Kokorin <ref type="bibr">[21,</ref> 221 (generalized to Dedekind rings): the decidability of torsion free abelian groups with a distinguished subgroup (9.10). In fact most of our general theory holds for more general structures than modules: for abelian groups with a family of additive relations.</p><p>Let M be a module. When are all compact modules elementarily equivalent to M the pure hull of a direct sum of indecomposables?</p><p>By the above mentioned result of Garavaglia this is the case, if M has elementary Krull dimension. Also if the lattice of pp-definable subgroups of M is linearly ordered this is true. On the other hand the pure hull of an atomless boolean ring is not the pure hull of a direct sum of indecomposables.</p><p>In Section 7 we define the notion of 'bounded width' and show:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">(1) If M has bounded width, then every compact module elementarily equivalent to M is the pure hull of a direct sum of indecomposables.</head><p>(2) If R is countable, the converse is true.</p><p>The width of a module depends only on the structure of the lattice of pp-definable subgroups. Elementary Krull dimension implies bounded width.</p><p>In Section 8 we study modules with elementary Krull dimension. (Often we say simply 'Krull dimension', but we do not mean the classical notion.)</p><p>Here we assign to every pair 4(M) c p(M) of pp-definable subgroups of a module M an ordinal (or a) dim,(cpl+), which measures the extent to which there is 'almost' a dense chain of pp-definable subgroups between 4(M) and q(M). Then M has Krull dimension iff dim,(M/O) &lt;a.</p><p>(Garavaglia has a similar 'dimension' in <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>.) We prove in Section 8: 8.6. If R is countable or dim,(qol+)&lt; 03, dimM(q/tJ) equals the Cantor-Bendixson rank of the topological space (q/+)nU,.</p><p>I do not know if the countability of the ring R is necessary. Thus, if R is countable and M has Krull dimension, eJM must be countable. The converse is also true:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8.1,8.4. Let R be countable. Then M has Krull dimension if UILI is countable ifi U, has a Cantor-Bendixson rank, which is then dim,(M/O).</head><p>As an application we give for modules M with Krull dimension an explicit description of all compact N, elementarily equivalent to M (9.1). It turns out that there is a smallest such N. This is the first step towards our solution of the (uncountable) spectrum problem for complete theories of infinite modules over a countable ring in Section 10.</p><p>Let for infinite M, I,(K) denote the number of non-isomorphic modules of cardinality K which are elementarily equivalent to M.

E.g. that M has finite Krull dimension if I&amp;+J &lt; 2"o.</p><p>Finally we characterize &amp;-categorical (that is due to Baur <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[27]</ref>) and X1categorical modules in (10.6).</p><p>We conclude this paper with an investigation of some notions of stability theory in the case of modules (this again was first done by Garavaglia in a special case <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>). Note that every module is stable. In 11.1 we characterize 'forking' by means of pp-definable subgroups. Then we determine regular and orthogonal types using indecomposables (this is in the special case when M@ M = M.) It turns out that regular types correspond to certain indecomposables.</p><p>(Most of the result in Section 11 were independently obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[26]</ref>.)

Whence a proper descending sequence of pp-definable subgroups of N/M yields a descending sequence of pp-definable subgroups of N with infinite indices. Algebraically compact modules Definition. A module M is algebraically compact (we say 'compact') if every homomorphism from a pure submodule N' of a module N to M can be extended to a homomorphism from N to M. pp-type is a type consisting of pp-formulas. For every Module M the following are equivalent: (a) M is a direct factor in every pure extension. (b) Every consistent pp-type p(x) over A c M, IA161RI+K0, is realized in M. (c) Every consistent pp-type p(x'&gt; over M is realized in M. (d) M is compact. Proof. (d)+(a). Let N be a pure extension of M. Apply the definition to the diagram N M----+M id to obtain h: N+ M. Then N= M@Ker h. (a)+(c). Let a' realize p in an elementary extension N of M. Since M is a direct factor of N there is a projection TT: N -+ M, rr r M = id,. Then r(a') realizes p in M. (c) -+ (b). Clear. (b) + (d). We note first that by 1.3, (b) implies that every consistent pp-type p(x) over M is realized in M. Let N' be a pure submodule of N and g a homomorphism from N' to M. Then g is a 'partial homomorphism' from N to M in the following sense: Defbftion. A partial mapping f from N to M which preserves pp-formulas (and negations of pp-formulas), i.e. Nkcp(a) + M~dfbN, cp PPf7 aedom f, (a) is called a partial homomorphism (isomorphism) from N to M. If dom f is a pure submodule of N, then f is a partial homomorphism (isomorphism) iff f is a homomorphism (isomorphism onto a pure submodule of M). Now, to prove (d), let f : A + M be a maximal extension of g to a partial homomorphism from N to M. Let b E iV be arbitrary. The pp-type P(X) =f(tp+WA)) =(&amp;f(a)) 1 Nbqo(b, a), UEA, cp PP) is consistent in M. For if Q(X, f(u)), i C n are in p, then realize p. Then f' = f U {(b, c)} extends f. Thus b E A. Corollary 3.3.

Realize p in a compact elementary extension N of M, by c. g = id, U((b, c)} is a partial homomorphism from M to N, extend it to a partial homomorphism f defined on B. f is not a partial isomorphism -for Mkcp(b, a), Nk ~(c, a) -but partially isomorphic on A.

Extend the partial homomorphism f-' 1 f(A) to a partial homomorphism g from N to an elementary extension M' of M with dom g = C. For all bE B we have tp+(gf(b)lA) 3 tp+(b/A) and therefore tp(gf(b)/A) = tp(b/A). Thus gf and f are partial isomorphisms. This shows that B is small over A. Corollary 3.8.

We call p indecomposable if H(p) is indecomposable. (See 3.6 for notation.) Note that every indecomposable has the form H(p).

If the set of pp-definable subgroups of M is linearly ordered, ppcomplete types which do not contain x A 0 are indecomposable. Proof. Let H(p)=H(a), where tp*(a)=p.

This implies that K and K/A are indecomposable.Let k be the residue class field A/Y%? For every A-moduleM[p] = {x E M 1 px = 0) and M/PM are k-vector spaces. If M is A/m", dimk(M[p]) = 1.Thus, if N, @A$ is a decomposition of M, we have dimk(iV1[p]) = 0 (say). Then Ni is torsionfree and must be 0.If M = di, dimk(M/pM) = 1. Thus, if Ni @A$ is a decomposition of M, we have e.g. dimk(N,/piV1) = 0. Then Ni is divisible and must be 0. Thus A is indecomposable and the pure hull of A.(3) All indecomposables occur. Let U be an indecomposable A-module. Choose aE U\O. We write h(a) = sup(n 1 p" divides a (in U)} ('height') and Ann(a)={rEA 1 ra=O} ('annihilator'). If Ann(a) = Ap"+' , we have Ann(p"a) =!IX Whence we can assume that Ann(a) = llJz or Ann(a) = 0. Case 1: h(a) = n, Ann(a) = YJ2. Choose b E U s.t. p"b = a. Then Ab =A/YJ2n'1 via b H 1 +!l8"+' and Ab is pure in U. Therefore U = Ab = A/YDnfl. Case 2: h(a) =m, Ann(a) = 0. Then a is uniquely divisible (in U) by all r E A \O. Ka is a well-defined submodule of U and isomorphic to K. Therefore U=Ka=K. Case 3: h(a) = n, Ann(a) = 0. Choose b E U s.t. p"b = a. Ab = A is then pure in U. Whence U = H(Ab) = Ab= A. Case 4: h(a) =a, Ann(a) = Vk By compactness there is a sequence a, = a, p%+i = ai, in U. Let M be the submodule generated by {ai}iEo. Then M=K/A via ai ++ l/pit1 +A. Thus U= MsK/A.Our proof shows that every compact non-zero A-module has an indecomposable direct factor. This follows also from the fact that every A-module has Krull dimension. See 7.3, 8.2. Remark. Let R be a valuation ring, K its quotient field. A fractional ideal is an additive subgroup of K which is closed under multiplication with elements of R. The indecomposable R-modules are A/B=pure hull of A/B, where B s A are fractional ideals. AIB and CID are isomorphic iff A/B and C/D are isomorphic iff A = XC, B = xD (x E K \O). Sketch of proof. Up to logical equivalence the pp-formulas q(x) are conjunction of formulas (P~,~(x) = 3y ay A bx (a E R, b E R \aR). The only relations between these formulas are l-(Pa,b(X) -+ (Pc,db(X) (c divides da).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_22"><head>Using 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>4 one sees that indecomposable types p correspond to pairs Q, h of proper ideals via P(X) = {VW,(X) t b E alu{-m,b(x) 1 W a&gt; U{cp,,l(X) I ati ~~U~bPdo,,,,b) I a E hl.It is easy to check that these types are just the types of the non-zero elements in the modules A/B. These modules are clearly small over every non-zero element. This proves the first assertion.Let k be an immediate maximally valued extension of the valued field K. To every fractional ideal A of K there corresponds, a fractional A = RA of I% A/B is a pure submodule of the compact module A/B. A type which is realized in A/B is realized in A/6 and therefore in A/B (for y + B and z + R are of the same type, if they have the same value). But if A/B and C/D realize a common non-zero type, they are isomorphic. This proves the second assertion.Note, that -using 5.4 -we have also determined the indecomposables for all commutative rings R where all localizations at maximal ideals are valuation rings (e.g. for Priifer rings). A local-global principle (5.4) allows us to transfer the result of 5.1 to more general rings. Theorem 5.2. Let R be a commutative ring for which all the Eocalizations RI, at maximal ideals are fields or discrete valuation rings. The indecomposable R-modules are Rm if RIoz is a field, and R&amp;R&amp;W' (n 2 l), Quot(R&amp;/R,, I&amp; Quot(R&amp; if Rm is a discrete valuation ring, where $I is any maximal ideal (all modules are viewed as R-modules.) Examples are: Dedekind rings, e.g. 7. The indecomposable abelian groups are Z(p") = cyclic group of order p" (n 3 l), Z(p") = the Pruefer group, Z, = the p-adic integers and (lJ, (p a prime number). Regular von Neumann rings (commutative, x2 divides x). Here all localizations Rm= R/m are fields. Thus e.g. if R is a boolan ring the indecomposable R-modules are Z(2) with R-module structure coming from a ring homomorphism R + Z(2). Thus the indecomposables correspond to the ultrafilters.</figDesc></figure>

Then MS @m Mm, where 9X ranges over all maximal ideals of R. Proof. It is well known that IN\ = b )Nm( mod 00. Now by 5.5 =rJ =n !mMm . &gt;Next we treat 'indecomposable pairs'. First note that most of our general theory holds for more general structures:Let L be any language containing 0, +, -. An additive L-structure '3 is an L-structure which is an abelian group (w.r.t. 0, +, -) and where f" : A" --, A is a homomorphism cf an n-place function symbol, in L), R" c A" is a subgroup (R an n-place relation symbol in L). pp-formulas are of the form 3x(p where cp is a conjunction of atomic formulas. It is now clear how to define "pure, compact, indecomposable, small, pure hull, etc." for additive structures. R-modules are additive I&amp;-structures which satisfy r(sx) = (rs)x and rx +sx = (r + s)x and lx = x. Now let R be a ring and L = LR U(P), P a unary predicate. A pair (U, V) where V is a submodule of the R-module U, is a special additive L-structure. Theorem 5.7. Let R be a Dedekind ring and V a submodule of the torsion-free R-module U. The pair (U, V) is indecomposable ifi it is of the form (Quot(R), 0), (Qc;t(R), Quot(R)), (I&amp;, I?* * '$Y), (l&amp;, 0) or (Quot(I&amp;), I&amp;,&gt;, '@ a prime ideal, n--Proof. By 5.4 (generalized version) we can assume that R is a discrete valuation ring. Let Rp be the maximal ideal, K the quotient field of R and k the quotient field of I?. The pairs (K O), UC K), (R tip?, (R 0) are indecomposable since U is indecomposable as an R-module and V is a pp-definable submodule. Assume (2, I?) = ( U1, VI&gt; 63 (U,, V,), a non&amp;trivial decomposition. Then -since I? and k/i? = K/R are indecomposable -we have e.g. VI = 0 and V, = U,. But then k cannot be the divisible hull of 8. It remains to show that (2, I?) is compact.

Let R be a recursive Dedekind ring with an effective l-l list Qi = Ra, + Rbi of all maximal ideals. Suppose that the cardinality of k,, can be computed from i. Then the theory of all R-modules is decidable. Proof. See 9.Note that in the case of 9.7, Theorems 9.4 and 9.5 yield also the decidability of the theory of torsion free or the theory of divisible R-modules. Pairs of torsion free modules over a Dedekind ring R. We determined the indecomposable torsion free pairs in 5.7 as (R,, R* . VI na 1, (i&amp;b 01, U&amp;3, &amp;3), C&amp;3, &amp;~3), K 01, (K M. By 8.2 (also true in this case) every torsion free pair has Krull dimension (we will show ~2). Thus every compact torsion-free pair is the pure hull of a direct sum of the indicated indecomposables. Notation. Let Q(X) be a pp-formula without the new predicate symbol P. "g mod P" is satisfied by a E (M, N) if a + N satisfies p(x) in M/N. We compute the rank in the topological space U of all torsion free indecomposables. Here (cp/$) is restricted to U. Since Ri,/(R&amp;3") z R/q", I&amp;/&amp;~K/R~ the pairs "A$ mod P" isolate the (I&amp;, R&amp;3"), which have therefore rank 0. Since (BG mod P) = {(k-,, Rv_x)} U{(&amp;, RI&amp;') 1 n &gt; ml, these sets form a base for the neighbourhoods of (I&amp;, I?,). (k*, I&amp;&gt; has rank 1. (Use quasicompactness.)

Thus let (M, N) be weakly saturated and compact and elementarily equivalent to (Z?,, R,) or (R, 0). Then M/N is weakly saturated, compact and elementarily equivalent to K/R, or I&amp;. Now one of the indecomposable direct factors of M/N must be K. Since all indecomposable factors of M/N are of the form U/V, where (U, V) is an indecomposable factor of (M, N), (K, 0) is an indecomposable factor of (A4, N).

The proof of 2.1(2) constructed 2"o contradictory pp-types with parameters sia. Now we need only the parameter a. This yields 2Ho contradictory types with 2 variables without parameters. Thus I,&amp;) = 2Ko. There is no sequence as above. Then there is rE R\O s.t. rM is divisible. rM is injective and, by 5.9, totally transcendental. rM is pure in M. N = M/rM is bounded: riV = 0. Then z is a finite sum of multiples of modules R/5$3". Therefore totally transcendental. Now M is totally transcendental by 2.2(l). Proof of 10.3 (contd.). (3) Let k be a finite field. R is the ring obtained from the polynomial ring k[X,, X,, . . .] by factoring through the ideal generated by all XiXi. Whence R is a commutative k-algebra, with k-basis 1, Ti, T2, . . . which satisfies TiTj = 0. Now look at the following R-modules M: M = M[T,] = M[T,] 1 M[T,] 1. -. , the T,M are contained in all M[Tj] and k-linearly independent.It is easy to see that all such modules are elementarily equivalent and that there are exactly K0 many countable M. (A countable M is determined up to isomorphism by dimk(n {M[T-,]1 i E w}/@~_, TiM).) Clearly M is not superstable (2.1(3)).(Case1: M does not have Krull dimension. By 6.8, M is elementarily equivalent to a direct sum eiel Ui of indecomposables, where all UE LJM occur-up to isomorphism-among the I_&amp;. A Loeweheim-Skolem argument shows, that there is a countable J c I with M = ejEJ Uj.

G(tp(u/O)) = G(tp(a/A)) just expresses independence of a and A in the sense of (b) of the definition before 6.3.

Injective modules (see 5.10, 5.11): If R is commutative, the regular types (which determine injective indecomposables) are in l-1 correspondence with the prime ideals of R. (For !$ is prime iff maximal among the irreducible ideals % with H(v) = H(g). See the proof of 5.11.) For noetherian commutative rings this result is due to Kucera [12]. p, q E S(A) are orthogonal iff for all B 3 A, a, b EM, tp(a/B), resp. tp(b/B) is a non-forking extension of p, resp. q+ tp(a/B U(b)) does not fork over A. Theorem 11.6 (*). Assume that M has bounded width. Then p, q E S(0) are orthogonal, ifl H(p) and H(q) have no isomorphic indecomposable factor in common. Proof. Let a, resp. b realize p, resp. q. If H(a) and H(b) have a common factor, H(a) n H(b) # 0. Whence a and b are not independent and p, q not orthogonal. (Take B = 0 in the definition above.) Assume now, that H(p) and H(q) have no non-trivial common factor. Let B, a, b as in the definition of orthogonality. Since H(b) has bounded width, H(b) = Q, Vi indecomposable. tp(b/B) does not fork over 0, the family H(B), Ui(i E I) is therefore independent. Suppose that H(a) depends on {H(B)}U {Ui}iEr_ Since no Ui is isomorphic to a direct factor of H(a), 6.2 shows that H(a) depends on H(B) alone. But this contradicts our assumption that tp(a/B) does not fork over 0. Thus H(a) does not depend on H(B) U{Ui}, i.e. a and B U(b) are independent.</figDesc></figure>

Then T is decidable if qi/$i ( Ui) depends recursively on i, j.</head><p>Proof. Note that {Ui}iEN is a closed subspace of UR. By a suitable adaptation of 6.13 two models M, N of T are elementarily equivalent iff qi/t,!ri(M) = c~J$~(N) for all i.

Since every sentence which is satisfiable in a model of T is satisfied in some finite direct sum of the Ui, we get an effective enumeration of all sentences consistent with T. Since also the set of all consequences of T is effectively enumerable we obtain the decidability of T.</p><p>Remark. One can prove that T is decidable iff T is axiomatizable and there is effective list cpi/+i of a base of UJJT s.t. The modules R/q" are isolated by the pairs Thus the R/q" have rank 0. (We compute the rank w.r.t. UJ".) K/R% is isolated by every pair B@ = ('@x 10 A'$" ) x)/(x&amp; 0). Since the (B$) = N/R,} U {R/V' 1 n &gt;m} are quasicompact, every infinite sequence of Rl!jF's converges to K/R%. Therefore K/R% has rank 1 and the (B,$) form a basis of neighbourhoods of K/R%.</p><p>The same reasoning shows that I&amp; has rank 1 and that the (C$) = ifi:,&gt; U {WV" 1 n &gt; ml form a basis of the neighbourhoods of I&amp;. C$ is the pair (!JP-1 1 x)/(v" 1 x). Since UR is quasicompact, the last indecomposable K must be of rank 2. The proof of 5.1 (case 2) shows that the *-type of any non-zero element of K is axiomatized by the pairs (r-1 x)(rIx~rx~O) (rgR\O).</p><p>Thus-by the proof of 4.9-these pairs constitute a base for the neighbourhoods of K. Every such neighbourhood contains all K/R,, I&amp;, and almost all R/q". Whence also the pairs D' = (x G x)/(mG 0) defines a basis of neighbourhoods of K.</p><p>Corollary 9.6. Let k, = IR/@\. Then the elementary type of an R-module M is determined by the invariants I,(M), where this is I*. This proves 10.1 in the case that M is totally transcendental.</p><p>If M is not superstable, we have IM = I6 for uncountable K by a general theorem of Shelah [17, VIII 0.33.

Therefore 2"i"'"'2"b'+4,4(K)~1M(K).</p><p>To prove the inverse inequality for K &gt; 2*0, we need the following lemma (here R is arbitrary). Lemma 10.2.

We conclude this section with a description of KO-and K,-categorical modules. (An infinite module is K-categorical iff the complete theory of it is K-categorical.) Theorem 10.6.

Since W is infinite, (JI = 1 and W is the only Uj (use (+) above). Thus I must be empty and {V,, . . . , v,} = {U,,}&amp;&amp;. Now the N = M are as claimed and therefore M is K,-categorical. Now let M be as in (b). M is not &amp;,-categorical, since dim M&gt;O. Since M is totally transcendental all N = M are given by 9.1. There is only one U, : W, which must be of rank I. Whence dim M = 1. Since cp/$(1M) is finite for all pairs cp/1,4 of dimension 0, 1 and J are empty. This shows that the N= M are as we wanted, which implies that M is X,-categorical.</p><p>Let conversely M be tC,-categorical.

Let PES(A), q the (!) non-forking extension of p to H(A). One knows that p is regular iff q is regular. q can be decomposed: If a realizes q and is written as a1 + a2 according to a decomposition H(A) @A, = M, tp(aJ is uniquely determined by p, and is regular iff p is. Therefore we will restrict ourself in the sequel to complete types over 0. We identify these types with pp-complete types.  Examples. If R is a Dedekind ring, the indecomposable modules which belong to regular types are Rl'$", R/R=, K.</p></div>			</div>
