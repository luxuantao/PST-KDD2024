<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) aims to provide a new convenient, comfortable, and safe driving way, and in turn enables intelligent transportation through wireless communications among road-side units, on-board units (OBUs), phones, and other devices inside a vehicle. However, significantly increasing reliance on wireless communication, control, and computing technology makes IoV more vulnerable to potential attacks, such as remote intrusion, control, and trajectory tracking. Therefore, efficient authentication solutions preventing unauthorized visitors need to be addressed to cope with these issues. Hence, in this paper we focus on the security and privacy-preserving by developing a dual authentication scheme for IoV according to its different scenarios. First, the OBU self-generates an anonymous identity and temporary encryption key to open an authentication session. Second, the legitimacy of the vehicle's real and anonymous identity can be verified by trust authority (TA). After that, the vehicle's reputation is evaluated according to its history interactive behavior and the session key for V2V can be finally established. There are three major advantages, including privacy-preserving and security enhancement without a burden of key management in the condition of acceptable time delay range, introducing trust evaluation into authentication protocol, as well as considering the vehicle behavior attributes in the new reputation evaluation method. In addition, we also prove the correctness of this scheme using the Manuscript</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>V EHICLES as mobile devices are usually equipped with sensors(e.g., speed, acceleration, position, rotational speed sensor), processor and wireless communication equipments (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3G/4G, OBU) to perform all terminal perception, computation and communication tasks. RSUs as public traffic infrastructure are fixed at the roadsides to connect vehicles to internet. They can communicate with each other using wireless technologies such as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) to form different scenarios including Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), which enable the warnings inclulding accidents (e.g., forward collision warning, blind spot warning), traffic conditions (e.g., congestion, emergency brake, pavement defect), online infotainment, and online payment to be shared to improve the driving comfort and safety. However, at the same time, the vulnerability of IoV to many potential attacks has also been revealed in some literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Therefore, in recent years, lots of network security protocols and solutions considering the characteristics (e.g., highly dynamic, selforganizing network topology) have been widely studied and applied to IoV. Among which, the identity authentication technology as an effective way is the first step to protect information security (e.g., integrity, confidentiality, non repudiation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Meanwhile, authentication and key agreement technology are also widely studied in other fields (e.g. smart grid, internet of things, mobile cloud networks) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It is an interesting and important research subject.</p><p>These authentication schemes mainly focus on privacy, efficiency and security, which can be roughly classified into three categories: cryptography based <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, reputation evaluation based <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and hardware based (e.g., Trusted Platform Module abbreviated as "TPM", Tamper Proof Device abbreviated as "TPD") trust enhancement architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Generally speaking, the cryptography based schemes (e.g., Public Key Infrastructure abbreviated as "PKI", Identity-Based Encryption abbreviated as "IBE") only consider whether the vehicle holds correct evidence or not, but ignore the vehicle behavior reputation. In particular, the PKI schemes require complex certificates and key management system, which will lead to Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) problem and cause high packet loss rate in high-traffic locations. Moreover, it is likely that the key escrow issue will occur in the IBE cryptosystem. The reputation system can dynamically increase or decrease vehicle credibility based on its behavior experience and achieve trust threshold verification, which is suitable for the highly self-organizing characteristic of IoV. But the system is usually subjective and lacks robustness to uncertain vehicle nodes. TPM-based authentication schemes are committed to building a trusted computing platform for vehicle node at the terminal layer. It controls vehicle reliability by monitoring its hardware (e.g. electronic control units, actuators, interfaces) and software (e.g. embedded operating system, on-board applications) operating environments and other intrinsic properties integrity. Through which, the authentication speed can be improved by using its self-cryptographic engine and the confidential information can be kept more securely. However, vehicles in IoV are no longer isolated but co-operative. Only with terminal security constraints is not enough.</p><p>These authentication methods mentioned above mainly address one aspect of security requirement. Although they can serve as an important reference for security goals achieving, they are usually not entirely satisfied with the special security requirements in V2V scenario because of vehicles' highly dynamic topology and self-organizing characteristics. In short, it's not enough merely with identity authentication, and behavior authentication is also needed to be taken into account. In this paper, TPM is redesigned to embed in every vehicle as a trusted root to provide integrity assessment report and store sensitive information. With its help, the comprehensive reputation can be evaluated from more dimensions. By PPDAS, the security and decision-making accuracy as well as privacy-preserving are expected to enhance.</p><p>The major contributions of PPDAS are listed as following: 1) Enhanced Security: In this paper, PPDAS leverages vehicle identity verification and reputation evaluation dual authentication to enhance security for some special V2V scenarios (e.g. temporary cooperative driving with high-security requirements). From which, the legitimacy of vehicle real and anonymous identity is firstly verified and followed by reputation evaluating.</p><p>2) Avoided Key Escrow Issue: Once an authentication session is opened, a temporary encryption key is established by using the bilinear pair theory. It can avoid the burden of key management and is difficult for attackers to obtain the key or even tamper message with it.</p><p>3) Strong Privacy-Preserving: Due to the using of temporary anonymous identity, the peers cannot resolve the real identity of each other and the privacy can be protected accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Time Delay Tolerance:</head><p>The confidentiality and information integrity are ensured only based on symmetric encryption and message authentication code to maintain efficiency.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II summarizes the related and previously published work on authentication. In Section III, the preliminary knowledge is presented. In Section IV, the proposed scheme is described in detail including scenario model and authentication process. In Section V, analysis and comparisons are included to prove the correctness and performance of PPDAS. The last Section VI concludes the whole paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>Some existing authentication techniques are available in the literature. On the basis of temporary certificate authentication, the papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduced preloading a set of short-term anonymous public and private key pairs, as well as the corresponding anonymous certificates for each vehicle. Roughly speaking, the message sender randomly selects a private key to sign messages, and the message receiver uses the public key of sender extracted from the associated certificate to verify its validity. However, this approach leads to CRLs problem and generates high communication overhead, as well as high computation cost and storage cost. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, a detailed authentication based on identity is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Later, the documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed IBE cryptosystems to achieve privacy-preserving authentication without considering the vehicle subjective behavior factors. Meanwhile, the document <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> summarized and presented an IBE communication framework for future networks. And the document <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> combined IBE with traditional public key encryption, in which, a vehicle can self-generate private key from its identity to free from the requirement of PKI.</p><p>Meanwhile, the reputation system was applied to the authentication process <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The survey papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> commented that the trust management was crucial to ensure IoV security due to its distinctive characteristics. They described and summarized the trust computing models, as well as analyzing characteristics suitable for ordinary fixed network and mobile ad hoc networks. Then, they pointed out the key issues we should pay attention in trust modeling for IoV. After that, based on vehicular application services, the documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> combined direct trust with neighbor recommendation trust together to evaluate node behavior reputation, which can pre-judge the trend of node behavior but involves subjectivity. In addition, the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> presented a new reputation evaluation method by taking both the trustworthiness of node and data into account. In the hybrid reputation system, the reputation is assessed in two dimensions of entity-oriented and data-oriented trust models to resist attack.</p><p>In order to improve the authentication efficiency, some researchers proposed to embed the dependable hardware (e.g., TPM, TPD), as a security chip into vehicles. Therefore, the encryption and decryption operation can be hardwareaided carried out and some sensitive information can be kept secretly. Later, TPM and TPD were comparatively analyzed in document <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, demonstrating that they both have message encryption ability, and TPD is of high price and intolerable to the high temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. And a scheme was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which uses TPM to check whether every component in a vehicle works accordingly in perfect order without tempering to secure IoV.</p><p>Inspired by previous works and the special issues on Internet of Things summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, The PPDAS is proposed to primarily address privacy-preserving, accuracy improvement of decision-making and security enhancement for V2V authentication. It is designed from two dimensions: identity authentication protocol and reputation system on the basis of TPM. It is different from the traditional methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PRELIMINARIES</head><p>Vehicles as intelligent mobile terminals in IoV are faced with more complex issues than traditional network terminals. But with the rapid development and successful application of trusted computing technology, it is possible to design new methods to evaluate node reputation and in turn guarantee secure V2V communications. Before describing PPDAS in detail, a brief introduction on the bilinear maps, some background on trusted computing and the definition of several terms are described in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Bilinear Maps</head><p>The basic definition of the pairing is described simply. More comprehensive description of pairing technique can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Let G 1 of large order q denotes a cyclic additive group and G 2 be a cyclic multiplicative group with |G 1 | = |G 2 |. P denotes a random generator of G 1 and the pairing is a map e :G 1 × G 1 → G 2 . The bilinear maps has the following three properties.</p><p>1) Bilinearity: For any P, Q ∈ G 1 and a, b ∈ Z * q , the formula e (a P, bQ) = e(P, Q) ab holds, Z * q = {ρ|1 ρ q -1}.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. TPM and Trusted Computing Technology</head><p>The concept of trusted computing is proposed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which is committed to addressing the growing trusted computing problem in information security field by integrating TPM as a trusted root on any device. TPM is a piece of hardware but requires software infrastructure to communicate with itself to protect data. It provides three basic features: data protection capability, integrity measurement, and integrity reporting to protect terminal security. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, illustrates the main components and the module structures of TPM.</p><p>In this paper, these components are summarized into three parts including: Execution, Storage and Crypto-related algorithm. And the most important function used in the paper is that TMP can run a secure program to record onboard software run-time configuration and send these data as an integrity assessment report to TA. TA then verifies the reported configurations with the required ones to confirm whether software has been attacked. Besides, TPM can sign or encrypt data sensed by vehicle using the stored information (e.g., SPK, key) and crypto-related algorithm.</p><p>The main goal of TPM is the integrity assessment. In this paper, assuming each vehicle has embedded TPM to assure data authenticity received from sensors, and contribute to the upper layer to calculate the direct trust in definition 3.</p></div>

PROPOSED SCHEME This section describes the proposed PPDAS in detail from the aspects of its typical scenario model and its authentication process. It addresses the security from two dimensions including the authentication protocol based on the feature of combining ID_based encryption and public key encryption, and the reputation evaluation model as represented in section III. The details are as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Scenario Model</head><p>The proposed scheme considers the typical scenario as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. It consists of TA, stationary RSUs, and some vehicles equipped with TPM and OBU running on the road.</p><p>As seen from the figure, there are three levels: On the bottom level, the vehicles equipped with an OBU can communicate with other vehicles or RSUs using DSRC. Furthermore, the embedded TPM is responsible for storing security materials and processing cryptographic operations. In the middle level, the RSU distributed all over the network can communicate with the TA over wired networks and be traced back to vehicles. On the top level, the TA trusted by all entities can verify the identity and call the Evaluation Server (ES) to calculate node reputation. The Identity Database (IDB) is auxiliary infrastructures assisting the work. When vehi cle i wants to establish a secure session with vehi cle j , they will firstly issue requests to RSU around for the authentication of each other. After preliminary processing, RSU forwards the request to the top level via wired channel to accomplish identity and reputation verification. Finally, the session key for them can be negotiated with the help of RSU.</p><p>The proposed authentication architecture is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. At the bottom of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, an inner architecture of vehicle and data flow among different components are displayed in detail: the environmental information parameters perceived by vehicle terminal basic sensors are submited to vehicle electronic control unit(ECUs). And then, ECUs call TPM to sign data and broadcast them through communication modules. From the top, the dual authentication scheme consisting of identity verify service and reputation verify service modules is displayed. It not only verifies the objective evidence holded by vehicle, but also checks its behavior reputation. Finally, the result as a reference for decision making is provided for the top traffic information service platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Steps of PPDAS</head><p>The proposed scheme involves five stages such as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>: system initialization phase, user registration phase, user login phase, vehicle authentication phase including session key agreement, and trust degree update phase. RSU shares a key k with TA which is securely stored locally. The authentication is launched by a vehi cle i and then proceeds according to the following interactive steps.</p><p>1) Phase 1: a) System initialization: In this phase, TA first runs the following steps to initialize the whole system.</p><p>Step 1 (TA Setup level): Firstly, TA asks Private key generator(PKG) to choose appropriate groups G 1 ,G 2 and a map e : as the master key of TA, and the associated public key as P pub = s P. Finally, the parameters G 1 ,G 2 ,q,e,P,P pub ,H 1 ,g are published and s is kept secretly by TA.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">G 1 × G 1 → G 2 .</formula><p>Step 2 (RSU Setup): TA computes P r = H 1 (I D r ) for each RSU as its public key, S r = s H 1 (I D r ) as the private key, and sends them to RSU via wired security transport protocol. Then, RSU picks a random integer r r ∈ Z * q and broadcast r r P r .</p><p>2) Phase 2: a) Registration by TA: The user of vehi cle i registers himself in TA using the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: The user sends user information including I D i ∈ {0, 1} * (e.g. telephone, email.), PW i and I N F O i of the vehi cle i to TA via a secure communication channel.</p><p>Step 2: After receiving the information of user i , TA randomly chooses a secret information parameter x i ∈ Z * q and builds relation with him using</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">R i = H (I D i ||PW i ) ⊕ x i .</formula><p>Then, the identify message Z i = H (I D i ||PW i ||x i ), which is used to check in the login phrase, the only identity token I M i = H 1 I D i ||x i ||T S reg ∈ G 1 and the partial private key as s I M i for vehi cle i are computed by TA. After that, TA stores I M i ,H PW i , T S reg ,T S reg ,x i in local database and issues parameters I M i ,s I M i , H (.),E (.),R i ,Z i into the security area of TPM via a secure channel (e.g., wired secure transport protocol).</p><p>3) Phase 3: a) Login by user: The vehicle can detect the error event immediately if the user is not valid in the phase. The following steps make up the login phase. Step 1: O BU i → RSU : m 0 = {AI D i , A i , T S i , r i P, P pub ,quer y}, O BU j → RSU : m 1 = {AI D j , A j , T S j , r j P, P pub } Once the vehi cle i wants to establish an authentication session, it firstly self-generates AI D i = H (I M i ||T S i ) as the temporary identity where T S i representing its current time stamp. The vehi cle i needs to establish a shared key with RSU without leaking the identity.</p><p>In order to encode the information transmitted on network, vehi cle i picks a random integer r i ∈ Z * q and computes k i = H 1 e r r P r , P pub r i as well as the session key SK i-r = g (k i ). Next, vehi cle i self-generates AI D i = H (I M i ||T S i ) as its temporary identity, where T S i representing the current time stamp, and sends m 0 as AI D i ,A i ,T S i ,r i P,P pub , ( px, py, acc, speed) j to RSU, where A i as E S K i-r I D i ||P pub ||I M i ||T S i and ( px, py, sp, acc) j representing the target vehicle information. After receiving m 0 , RSU locates vehi cle j by ( px, py, sp, acc) j and get his message m 1 = AI D j , A j , T S j , r j P, P pub from vehi cle j like m 0 .</p><p>Step 2: RSU → T A : m 2 = {C, AI D i , AI D j , M AC, T S r , P r } Upon receiving m 0 from O BU i , RSU firstly checks whether |T -T S i | &lt; T holds or not, where T denotes the current time of RSU, T is a special time period of experience value. If yes, using the received r i P, RSU computes k r = H 1 (e (r r S r , r i P)), as well as the session key SK r-i = g (k r ).

RSU uses SK r-i to decrypt A i as D S K r-i (A i ). Then, RSU retrieval I D i and P pub , and checks whether P pub in A i is equal to the plaintext in message m 0 and the same operation of m 1 . After that, RSU retrievals the shared key (k) with TA from the local database and computes MAC as Step 3: T A → RSU : m 3 = {AI D i , AI D j , T D i , T D j , E x i (q r i r t ) , E x j (q r i r j ) , T S t , σ, M} After receiving m 2 from RSU, TA checks whether |T -T S r | &lt; T holds or not. If the equation holds, TA verifies the real and anonymous identity as follows: Firstly, TA uses I D r to retrieval key(k) between himself and RSU, then it computes M AC * = H 1 (P r ||C||T S r ||k) and checks whether M AC * = M AC holds or not to confirm the identity I D r and message not been tampered. Secondly, if yes, TA decrypts C using k to retrieval plaintext, TA retrievals x i and T S reg according to Step 4: O BU i ↔ O BU j : m 4 = X i j Upon receipt of m 3 , both vehicles proceed as follows. Check the time stamp T S t to prevent replay attack. Then, checks whether signature σ is valid using If T D i and T D j both match the trust threshold of each other. They can communicate using the Sk i-j = H (AI D i , AI D j , P pub , q r i r j r t ) session key to keep X i j = (Sk i-j , data) security.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">I D i from local database to compute I M * i = H I D i ||x i| |T S reg , then it checks if I M in</formula><p>5) Phase 5: a) Login password update and trust value update: Also, it is necessary for user to update the login password dynamically to keep others who know the password from doing impersonation attacks. So users can update the login password as follows: User sends password updating request to TA through human-machine interface after finishing login phase. TA judges by computing H * = H PW i , T S * reg and checks if the input I D i is equal to the identity in database and H * = H all holds or not.

Then they respectively send the message SK i j AI D j , rate j , P r and SK j i {AI D i , rate i , P r } to RSU. And RSU sends E k AI D i , rate i , AI D j , rate j as a reputation update request to TA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Security Analysis 1)</head><p>Resistance to the Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Suppose an active attacker wants to intercept and tamper the messages transferred in communication channel to conduct manin-the-middle attack. He needs to tamper A i or A j in messages m 0 or m 1 . However, they are constructed by symmetric encryption with the temporary key SK i-r = g (k i ) = g H 1 e r r P r , P pub r i = SK r-i = g (k r ) = g (H 1 (e (r r S r , r i P))) between vehicle and RSU, which is negotiated only by the owner's parameters. In m 3 , the signature</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">σ i = s M i = s H 1 (m) = s H 1 (AI D i ||T D i ||T S t</formula><p>) is actually a pseudo-ID-based and trust-degree-based signature. It is infeasible to forge a valid signature without knowing the TA's private key s. Because of the NP-hard computation complexity of Diffie-Hellman problem in e, it is difficult to derive s H 1 (AI D i ||T D i ||T S t ) by way of AI D i , T D i , T S t , P, and P pub . Therefore, the pseudo-ID-based signature is unforgeable. Furthermore, the messages m 2 , m 3 , m 4 are all calculated by the hash function or encryption, and the attacker will face the difficulty of breaking the secure one-way hash function and the decryption difficulty if he wants to tamper them. Above all, the proposed scheme is secure enough to prevent the man-in-the-middle attack.</p><p>2) Resistance to Replay Attacks: According to the whole interaction process in this paper, all messages combined with time stamp to provide freshness. Furthermore, the peers independently chose the random parameter r i to compute temporary encryption key SK i-r to ensure freshness at the beginning of each authentication session. Above all, the proposed scheme can resist replay attack effectively.</p><p>3) Anonymity and Identity Privacy-Preserving Enhancement: If the real identity is transmitted in plaintext form on network, the attacker can get it easily by intercepting or analyzing the message. And although the anonymity identity is used to protect privacy, the attacker can still violate the trajectory privacy if anonymity does't change for a long time. In our scheme, once the authentication session is opened, vehicle computes and uses anonymity instead of its real identity. And the anonymity changes dynamically according to different communication session by the hash of current time and I M, which only T A can parse it out. Above all, attacker can get nothing about the user privacy by storing or reusing.</p><p>4) Resistance to Password Guessing Attack: In our scheme, the attacker can get nothing about user password because there doesn't exist user password in all the communicate messages. So password guessing attack can't be finished here.</p><p>Finally, in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, the overall security comparison between our scheme and some existing schemes is listed. And it can be seen that our scheme can meet all the requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performance Evaluation</head><p>Here, we evaluate our scheme from the aspects of efficiency and network performance. </p><formula xml:id="formula_20">, C E x , C S E , C AE , C V eri , C Sig , C B P , C M , C M E</formula><p>respectively represent the cost of hash, reputation, symmetric cipher, asymmetric cipher, verification, signature, bilinear pairing, multiplication and nodular exponentiation operation. As the cost of X O R and joined operation are rather cheap, they are not included in the comparison. The Table IV in the following lists the computation overhead for some different operations based on the Crypto++ library <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we use CBC-HMAC AES <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and SAH-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to compute MAC value. The machine parameter is Intel(R) Core(TM) i3 CPU, M 370 2.4GHz and RAM is 6GB. The overall results depended on Table <ref type="table">III</ref> are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref>, the computing cost in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is much cheaper than ours. However, as discussed previously in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, they are both vulnerable to the replay attacks and lack privacy protection. In our scheme, the encrypt key and decrypt key in each authentication session is real-time computed to avoid key escrow problem and keep freshness. Whereas, the generation and distribution of encrypt key and decrypt key totally depends on TA, which will inevitably incur huge key management (e.g. periodical updates, revoke) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Furthermore, the identity of vehicle is constant and exposed outside, which is easy to be traced by other malicious vehicle in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. And the same as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> involving certificates can easily cause high packet loss and CRLs problem. And scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> cannot resist the replay attack. What's more, the reliance on PKI/CA make the channel full of many certificates and a great of the bandwidth is occupied. Whereas, our scheme can avoid this problem.</p><p>Although no explicit performance advantage for ours can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref>, the temporary encryption key agreement between vehicle and TA based on bilinear pairing avoid key escrow and save much more storage as well as computation cost. And the dual authentication improves the security and decision-making accuracy.</p><p>2) Average End-to-End Delay: We use network simulator OMNeT++ to build VANET scenarios integrated with bidirectional coupling tool VEINS and traffic simulation tool SUMO to verify the network performance after using this scheme. The simulation scenario has 10-140 vehicles with acceleration 2m/s2 and speed 5-30m/s, IEEE 802.11p to simulate the transmission protocol, and data rate of 6 Mb/s. The average delay is calculated according to the formula defined in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_21">M D = 1 N N i=1 1 M K M m=1 K k=1 (T i,k,m recv -T i,k,m send ).</formula><p>Where N, M, K , T i,k,m recv , and T i,k,m send respectively represent the number of vehicles, the number of messages sent by vehi cle i , the number of adjacent vehicles within DSRC communication range of vehi cle i , the moment the vehi cle k receives the mth message from vehi cle i in application layer, and the moment vehi cle i sends the mth message to vehi cle k . We compare the proposed scheme with others referred above in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref>. And the results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p><p>In the Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.a, the y-axis represents the average authentication time costs and x-axis represents the number of vehicle. From it, the trend of these curves is similar with the increasing of the node number, and they are nearly overlapped. So, it can be seen that the proposed scheme does not increase too much authentication time. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.b shows the relationship between MD and vehicle speed, where the x-axis represents the average speed changing from 10-40m/s (36-144km/h). As seen from this figure, the MD is not affected too much by the speed changing when the speed of vehicles is slow than 40m/s. The relationship between MD and the city traffic load has been shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.c. It can be seen that the performance of the proposed scheme is similar to the literature of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It increases a little addition delay in high-density traffic flow, but it performs much better when the number of vehicle is less than 80. Analyzing the scheme by combining Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref>, it can be seen that our paper enhances the security, improves the privacy-preserving and avoids the key escrow issue within an acceptable range of time delay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Along with the rapid emerging of various new network applications and new security requirements for particular scenarios, a new field for the research of authentication and key agreement protocol is opened. Our work mainly focuses on the heuristics design considering the specific application and communication scenario requirements. Accordingly, a novel authentication scheme (PPDAS) is proposed to enhance security and privacy for V2V communications in intelligent transportation systems. PPDAS exploits the advantage of bilinear pairing to compute encryption key without needing additional key management. Meanwhile, vehicles can establish session key without knowing the real identity of each other to effectively protects privacy. Furthermore, the dual verification leverages identity and behavior authentication to improve decisionmaking accuracy. Although the above results are achieved, there are still many open areas worthy for further study: such as formal analysis and design of new authentication protocols for vehicle networks and new methods to provide the compatibility between new and previous cryptographic systems. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be extended or generalized as the attribute based key agreement protocol to realize fine-grained authorization and access control, by treating the identity as an attribute of entity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
