<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Pre-trained language models have recently shown that training on large corpora using the language modeling objective enables few-shot and zero-shot capabilities on a variety of NLP tasks, including commonsense reasoning tasks. This is achieved using text interactions with the model, usually by posing the task as a natural language text completion problem. While using language model probabilities to obtain task specific scores has been generally useful, it often requires task-specific heuristics such as length normalization, or probability calibration. In this work, we consider the question answering format, where we need to choose from a set of (free-form) textual choices of unspecified lengths given a context. We present ALC (Answer-Level Calibration), where our main suggestion is to model context-independent biases in terms of the probability of a choice without the associated context and to subsequently remove it using an unsupervised estimate of similarity with the full context. We show that our unsupervised answer-level calibration consistently improves over or is competitive with baselines using standard evaluation metrics on a variety of tasks including commonsense reasoning tasks. Further, we show that popular datasets potentially favor models biased towards easy cues which are available independent of the context. We analyze such biases using an associated F1-score. Our analysis indicates that answer-level calibration is able to remove such biases and leads to a more robust measure of model capability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Language models (LM), trained on large corpora, have been shown to exhibit few-shot and zero-shot learning capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Radford et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al., 2020)</ref> using only text interactions, as opposed to finetuning the model parameters using task specific training examples. Relying purely on text interactions for few-shot ability shifts the fo-cus to designing and utilizing suitable task-specific natural language templates.</p><p>In this work, we focus on free-form multiple choice question answering (and commonsense reasoning tasks in particular), where given a context and a set of choices of unspecified lengths, a model is required to select the most suitable choice. To enable zero-shot learning, the typical approach is to form textual sequences by concatenating the context independently with each choice and then scoring the concatenated strings using a pre-trained LM.</p><p>While LM probabilities have been shown to provide useful estimates of choice probabilities given a context, there is no incentive to treat the choices as equal in the absence of the associated context. For example, the LM probabilities in a neutral context are likely to be determined by frequency. In this work, we explore the role of biases that are likely to be associated with the choices naturally due to the language modeling objective. We propose ALC<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> (Answer-Level Calibration), where we use a neutral context to model such biases and remove them using a scaling factor determined by how similarly a model handles the question context as compared to a neutral context.</p><p>Further, we show that popular datasets favor models which rely on easy cues which are context independent. We use a bias-specific F1 score to analyze such biases. Our results indicate the need for answer-level calibration for more accurate estimates of model capabilities, or equivalently the design of better datasets. We hope our work will be useful for further research in both those directions. Specifically, we analyze context-independent biases related to length, part-of-speech (POS) and neutral context probabilities of the choices.</p><p>In summary, we make the following contributions:</p><p>1. We present ALC, a model-agnostic approach to improve the unsupervised performance of pretrained LMs for free-form multiple choice question answering, including commonsense reasoning tasks. 2. We show that popular datasets favor models relying on context-independent easy cues and demonstrate the need for answer-level calibration to better estimate model capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Prompts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jiang et al. (2020)</ref> show that manually created templates can be sub-optimal in extracting knowledge from LMs, and propose mining and paraphrasing-based approaches using training examples. Schick and Schütze (2021) highlight the importance of selecting templates for enabling fewshot learning.</p><p>Calibration Probabilities output by neural networks are known to suffer from lack of calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Guo et al., 2017)</ref>, including LM output probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Braverman et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zhao et al. (2021)</ref> use token-level calibration to improve on few-shot classification and generation tasks. In contrast, we show that answer-level calibration is more suitable for the multiple choice setting that we consider. While we focus on free-form multiple choice questions in this work, when the choices are single tokens, for example in a classification task where the choices are True and False, answer-level calibration would behave similar to token-level calibration. As a result, answer-level calibration can be seen to have a more general scope as also illustrated empirically through our experiments.</p><p>Further, our analysis (Section 3.4) shows that answer-level calibration provides a more reliable measure of model performance on datasets with potential biases.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jiang et al. (2021)</ref> explore supervised methods, including finetuning as well as post-hoc methods, to improve calibration using training examples. In this work, we focus mainly on unsupervised calibration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al. (2020)</ref> generally perform length normalization over the token probabilities for a choice, while observing that for a select few tasks they obtain performance gains when using an answer-level calibration scheme (which corresponds to the unscaled version in Equation 3 of ALC). They use task specific development sets to choose between length normalization and answer-level calibration which is undesirable for few-shot learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kann et al., 2019)</ref>, and specifically for zero-shot learning. In this work, we show that unscaled calibration (as in Equation <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is suboptimal, compared to our proposed scaled version.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Answer-level calibration</head><p>More recently, Holtzman et al. ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>) also arrive at a formulation equivalent to the unscaled version of ALC but are motivated differently. Specifically, they hypothesize that the possibility of different surface forms of the same concept causes a competition between surface forms when scored by the LM. In contrast, we are motivated by calibration concerns and the presence of context-independent biases. We justify this motivation through bias associated evaluation (Section 5.2) for both the unscaled and scaled versions of ALC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative approaches using enhanced context</head><p>One way to make the probability estimates of the choices more accurate is to enhance the context using more task-specific cues. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al. (2020)</ref> show that with just a few in-context examples, significant gains in performance can be obtained. At the same time, it has been shown that the order of examples as well as token-level calibration in such prompts can be critical for getting good performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Zhao et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kumar and Talukdar, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>While the gains from enhanced context through additional examples may be complementary to answer-level calibration, we focus on the zeroshot setting in this work. In the zero-shot setting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Shwartz et al. (2020)</ref>, working on the question answering format, propose generating textual clarifications using the pre-trained LM itself, to enhance the context and improve zero-shot performance of pre-trained LM on commonsense reasoning tasks.</p><p>While their method has a much higher computational cost, we use it as an unsupervised baseline and show improvement over it on most tasks we consider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ALC: Proposed Method</head><p>We introduce the problem setting and notation in Section 3.1. We briefly describe our motivation in Section 3.2 and discuss the core idea of removing context-independent biases in Section 3.3. We provide the natural language formatting used in our experiments in Section A.3. We discuss bias associated measures in Section 3.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Notation</head><p>We consider a problem setting where an example consists of a textual context C and K textual choices (or options) O k , k ∈ [K], and we need to predict which choice O k fits best in context C. For example, in the case of question answering, this amounts to answering a question contained in the context C. Additionally, we define an instanceindependent neutral context C φ , where we expect all choices to be equally likely.</p><p>Denoting the gold answer by Y , the evaluation data is comprised of N instances defined by the tuples</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(C i , [O i k ], Y i ), k ∈ [K], i ∈ [N ].</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Motivation</head><p>Our main motivation is to evaluate the suitability of pretrained LMs for free-form multiple choice question answering where we contend that raw conditional phrase probabilities do not satisfy a natural requirement for such tasks (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>). We suggest and evaluate modifications to meet this requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Removing Context-independent Biases</head><p>We aim to obtain a probabilistic model M which provides estimates P M (O|C), the probability of a choice O given the context C. Predictions y for an example can subsequently be made using:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y = argmax k (P M (O k |C))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We wish to build such a model using a pretrained LM, e.g., GPT2. Such a LM, trained on the task of next word prediction, is expected to provide estimates of word probabilities given a textual context. For example, given the sequence of words w 1 w 2 ...w i , we expect GPT2 to provide probability estimates P L (w i+1 |w 1 w 2 ...w i ). Applying chain rule, we can obtain estimates of phrases given a textual context. For example, we could obtain estimates of P L (O|C).</p><p>Can P L (O|C) serve as a proxy for P M (O|C)? It is tempting to expect the LM probabilities P L (O|C) to serve as a proxy for P M (O|C) when we can format the task in natural language. However, under the assumption that all choices O k are equally likely given a neutral context C φ , this approximation can be sub-optimal. For it to be optimal, we would need</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P L (O 1 |C φ ) = P L (O 2 |C φ )... = P L (O K |C φ )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>However, given that these are task and instance specific choices, there is no incentive in the language modeling objective to ensure this condition.</p><p>To address this, we define a new score S L (O|C) to behave as expected with a neutral context:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S L (O k |C) = log P L (O k |C) − log P L (O k |C φ )</formula><p>(3) Predictions can subsequently be made using:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y = argmax k (S L (O k |C))<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Scaling the bias term: Equation 3, while desirable, makes a strong assumption about how the bias is present in the LM. While valid unquestionably for the neutral context, the bias in a trained (on task-specific data, or on a task-independent pretraining corpus) model is likely to depend on the context as well. For instance, a longer or more familiar context (in terms of similarity to training contexts) may mean the model is less reliant on context-independent cues. We therefore define a scaled version for removing biases, where the function g outputs the scaling term (ranging in [0, 1]):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S L (O k |C) = log P L (O k |C) − g(C, C φ ) * log P L (O k |C φ )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>We would want this formulation to preserve the requirement in Equation 2 which was satisfied by the unscaled version in Equation <ref type="formula">3</ref>. Specifically, we want g(C φ , C φ ) = 1 which would assign an equal score to each choice O k given a neutral context.</p><p>To get a model-agnostic<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> estimate of g, we think of log P L (O k |C) and log P L (O k |C φ ) as outputs from different models M and M φ respectively, and g as a measure of similarity between the models. Note that while M uses the available context C, M φ uses only the neutral context C φ . The intuition is that if M and M φ are identical, there is no new information provided by M and we want to set g(C, C φ ) = 1, leading to S L (O k |C) = 0. On the other hand, if M and M φ are very dissimilar, we can rely on the contextual scores of M and set g(C, C φ ) = 0, leading to</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S L (O k |C) = log P L (O k |C)</formula><p>. Specifically, to estimate g, we compute a similarity metric between the token probabilities (across the model's entire vocabulary) output by the two models.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">g(C, C φ ) = Sim(p f L (C), p f L (C φ ))<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where p f L indicates the probability vector output by the model across the vocabulary for the first token given the corresponding context. In this work, we consider Total Variation Distance (TVD), and Bhattacharyya Coefficient (BC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bhattacharyya, 1943)</ref>.</p><p>When using TVD, we subtract it from 1, to obtain a similarity estimate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">g TVD (C, C φ ) = 1 − 0.5 * ||p f L (C) − p f L (C φ )|| 1<label>(</label></formula><p>7) while we directly use BC:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">g BC (C, C φ ) = V i=1 p f L (C)[i] * p f L (C φ )[i] (8)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Bias Associated Measures</head><p>Consider an instance and choice specific attribute</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">A i (O i k ) which can take values a j , j ∈ [J].</formula><p>If we expect the attribute to be uncorrelated with task performance, we expect a model to perform similarly when evaluating subsets with different distributions of attributes A i (O k ) = a j . If a model relies on specific values of the attribute and if the evaluation data has sufficient representation of that value, standard evaluation metrics which ignore this attribute may provide an erroneous estimate of the model capability. As an extreme example, consider A(.) to denote whether the selected choice corresponds to the shortest choice among all choice O k , k ∈ [K], with the attribute values being true/false. Assume then that the evaluation data is dominated by instances where A i (Y i ) = true, i.e., with a high probability, the correct answer in the evaluation data is the shortest choice. Consider also a model which always chooses the shortest choice, irrespective of the content. The model would return close to perfect scores using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy against gold labels.</p><p>To analyze the impact of such attributes, we use a macro F1 score which takes into account the partitions created by an attribute. Recalling that an instance is represented by the tuple</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(C i , [O i k ], Y i ), i ∈ [N ],</formula><p>and letting Ŷ i be the model prediction, we define precision (P), recall (R) and F1 scores for each attribute value a j , and subsequently an attribute specific macro F1 score (F1 A ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P (A,a j ) = #{(A i ( Ŷ i ) = a j ) &amp; ( Ŷ i = Y i )} #{A i ( Ŷ i ) = a j } (9) R (A,a j ) = #{(A i ( Ŷ i ) = a j ) &amp; ( Ŷ i = Y i )} #{A i (Y i ) = a j } (10) F1 (A,a j ) = 2 * P (A,a j ) * R (A,a j ) P (A,a j ) + R (A,a j )<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">F1 A = Average({F1 (A,a j ) })<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where #{.} denotes the count of the corresponding set. If the model performs similarly irrespective of the attribute value, the macro F1 score F1 A is equal to the standard measure of accuracy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Accuracy = #{ Ŷ i = Y i } N (13)</formula><p>4 Experimental Setup</p><p>The datasets used and the corresponding prompts are described in Section 4.1.

On the other hand, the uncalibrated baseline severely penalizes longer answers as expected. ALC improves on both subsets and provides a better alternative to length normalization.

(Section 5.1) Q2 Does the aforementioned evaluation reflect true model capability? To answer this question, we perform a series of bias associated evaluations (see Section 3.4) and also evaluate whether ALC helps overcome such biases.

Finally, ALC outperforms or is competitive with self-talk 5 while being significantly less computationally intensive. ALC requires scoring two strings (context input and neutral input) for each choice, while self-talk requires generating hundreds of clarification texts using data-dependent templates and subsequently scoring them.

Note that the F1 performance of uncalibrated and length-normalized baselines on PIQA and ARC (Easy) is much higher when LM-Best=true, i.e., when the correct choice is also the most likely choice without considering the context. An important takeaway here is that while standard evaluation did not distinguish ALC from the baselines, ALC is not overly reliant on context-ignorant LM probabilities. Please see Section 5.2.3 for more details.</p><p>Norm-Best and LM-Norm-Worst respectively. Briefly, our experiments reveal that while the datasets considered don't share a similar bias pattern, each usually suffers from at least one bias considered in this work, i.e., there is a drop in performance when measured using the bias associated score. We present the detailed results for commonsense reasoning tasks in Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">12</ref>, using gpt2-xl model, while highlighting the key takeaways here. Recall that in the absence of biases in the model, the F1 score should match the accuracy score.</p><p>In the following sections, we provide a more directed analysis on the presence of such biases, on datasets where such biases are most prominent, and if ALC helps alleviate such biases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Length</head><p>We create subsets of the CommonsenseQA and SocialIQA dev set with specific properties to evaluate if the LM-Baseline has the associated biases and if they are addressed by ALC. First, we create subsets of examples where the shortest/longest answer is the correct answer. We expect longer sentences to have lower probabilities than shorter sentences with the uncalibrated baseline. Additionally, with the length normalized variant, where the final score is obtained as the mean of conditional log-probabilities instead of the sum (as in the uncalibrated baseline), longer sentences could potentially be favored. We report the uncalibrated and ALC's performance in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Note that both uncalibrated baseline and the length-normalized variants favor one subset at the cost of the other, while ALC improves on both. In particular, the uncalibrated baseline has a much poorer recall when the longest answer is correct. On the other hand, the length normalized variant has a much poorer recall when the shortest answer is correct. The results indicate that ALC provides a viable alternative to length normalization for handling length biases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">POS</head><p>We analyze potential part of speech (POS) tag biases in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Considering the CommonsenseQA dataset, we create subsets of the data where the correct answer is of the POS tag noun, verb or adjective. Note that ALC shows less variation in performance (F1) across these subsets when compared to uncalibrated baseline while improving on each subset. In particular, the maximum difference in F1 scores is 8.1 for the uncalibrated baseline while it is 5.03 for ALC (BC). ALC also improves over the length normalized variant for each subset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Context-ignorant LM Probability</head><p>To understand how much of the unsupervised performance comes from context-independent LM biases, we analyze subsets where the correct answer is most/least likely without the context. We report the performance on the PIQA and ARC datasets in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> and show that such biases indeed exist. The key takeaway is that the standard evaluation metrics may not give an accurate estimate of performance and that ALC provides more reliable estimates. Finally, we report macro F1 scores for LM-Norm-Best and LM-Norm-Worst evaluation in Table 6 on PIQA and SWAG datasets. The results indicate that the datasets favours length normalization aware scoring irrespective of the context. When we measure the bias associated score, ALC generally performs better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Expected Calibration Error</head><p>Given a score S(O k |C) for each choice O k , we can compute a confidence estimate conf(O k |C) as:   </p><formula xml:id="formula_18">conf(O k |C) = e S(O k |C) k ∈[K] e S(O k |C)<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">ECE = R r=1 |B r | N |acc(B r ) − conf(B r )| (15)</formula><p>where acc() and conf() measure the accuracy and mean confidence respectively in a bin. We set the number of bins to be 20. We report the average difference in accuracy and ECE compared to the uncalibrated baseline across the evaluation datasets (except WinoGrande) in Table 7. When compared to the uncalibrated baseline, ALC provides gains in calibration error while also improving performance. Length-normalization also improves ECE, presumably by correcting for length bias. However, length-normalization does not improve performance on an average. The relative performance gains of ALC can be explained through the handling of additional biases beyond length bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We propose ALC (Answer-Level Calibration), an unsupervised method to improve performance of pretrained language models. We show that, when compared to existing baselines, ALC is more suitable for free-form multiple choice question answering, including commonsense reasoning tasks. We also show that popular datasets favor models which rely on easy cues for predictions, and that ALC provides more reliable estimates of model capabilities by getting rid of some of these biases.
