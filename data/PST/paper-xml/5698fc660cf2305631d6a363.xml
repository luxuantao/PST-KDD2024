<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dynamic multiobjective optimization (DMO) has received growing research interest in recent years since many real-world optimization problems appear to not only have multiple objectives that conflict with each other but also change over time. The time-varying characteristics of these DMO problems (DMOPs) pose new challenges to evolutionary algorithms. Considering the importance of a representative and diverse set of benchmark functions for DMO, in this paper, we propose a new benchmark generator that is able to tune a number of challenging characteristics, including mixed Pareto-optimal front (convexity-concavity), nonmonotonic and time-varying variablelinkages, mixed types of changes, and randomness in type change, which have rarely or not been considered or tested in the literature. A test suite of ten instances with different dynamic features is produced from the generator in this paper. Additionally, a few new performance measures are proposed to evaluate algorithms for DMOPs with different characteristics. Six representative multiobjective evolutionary algorithms from the literature are investigated based on the proposed DMO test suite and performance measures. The experimental results facilitate a better understanding of strengths and weaknesses of these compared algorithms for DMOPs.</p></div>

In other words, dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithms (DMOAs) must be capable of tracking the changing Pareto-optimal front (POF) to provide a diverse set of solutions that approximates the new POF over time.</p><p>Artificial benchmark problems have played a fundamental role in determining whether a DMOA has the ability to solve DMOPs. Furthermore, benchmark problems contribute to analyzing and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a DMOA in order to modify it and improve its performance. However, one of the main issues in the field of dynamic multiobjective optimization (DMO) is that there are no standard test functions, and a few publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> pointed out that there should be more investigation of DMOPs to promote the research of DMO. Such issue is, however, yet to gain as much attention as the fields of static MOPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and dynamic single-objective optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>The first research on constructing DMOPs was conducted by Jin and Sendhoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, who proposed to aggregate different objectives of the existing static MOPs and vary the weights dynamically. Later, Farina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> made a clear classification of DMOPs according to the possible effects of environmental changes on the POF and the Pareto-optimal set (POS), and they also considered several dynamic scenarios that may appear in dynamic environments. Following those scenarios, they further suggested a test suite of five FDA test functions based on the existing DTLZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and ZDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> test suites of static MOPs. Since then, various dynamic benchmarks have sprung up in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Recalling those existing DMOPs, we can observe that most of commonly used DMOPs are adapted from the DTLZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and ZDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> test suites. In other words, they are the variants of the FDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> test problems. As a consequence, they share more or less same or similar properties (e.g., same objective functions). Furthermore, few have taken into account the following characteristics: 1) mixed POFs in terms of convexity and concavity that change over time; 2) complicated diversity-resistant schemes that hinder a set of diverse solutions; 3) problems that can change between different types during the evolution; and 4) nonmonotonic and time-varying relationship between variables instead of static monotonic variable-linkage used in the literature. The lack of the above-mentioned characteristics in DMOPs implies that the DMOPs currently used in the literature are not sufficiently diverse and challenging. Therefore, developing a new set of 2168-2267 c 2016 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.</p><p>See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.</p><p>test functions that covers those characteristics to compare the performance of DMOAs becomes meaningful and essential, which is greatly needed for the domain of DMO.</p><p>Based on the understanding of the limitations of current DMOP test problems and inspired by the works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, we have recently proposed a new benchmark generator <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for DMOPs that can generate DMOPs with several complex characteristics, e.g., changing POFs of mixed types featuring both convexity and concavity, which are rarely tested in the literature. Following this line, in this paper, we further develop the proposed benchmark generator and produce a general class of DMOPs with more dynamisms and characteristics for facilitating theoretical analysis in DMO.</p><p>Besides suggesting a number of test instances derived from the benchmark generator, in this paper, we also discuss performance metrics used for DMO. Two new performance measures are thus proposed, providing more information about the performance of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). We also test six representative MOEAs due to their recency and reported success. A fair and comprehensive comparison helps to compare the performance of algorithms and assess the nature and difficulty of the proposed benchmark functions. For this purpose, we also examine some performance metrics, including two new ones proposed in this paper, for assessing DMO algorithms for DMOPs.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a brief review of related work on DMO. Section III introduces the proposed benchmark generator and a set of test cases derived from the generator. Performance metrics are discussed in Section IV. Section V presents a fair and comprehensive comparison of MOEAs on the proposed test suite. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>There are many dynamic characteristics involved in DMOPs, and different DMOPs may have different mathematical definitions. This paper focuses on the DMOPs defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">min F(x, t) = ( f 1 (x, t), . . . , f M (x, t)) T s.t. ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ h i (x, t) = 0, i = 1, . . . , n h g i (x, t) ≥ 0, i = 1, . . . , n g x ∈ x , t ∈ t (1)</formula><p>where M is the number of objectives, and n h and n g are the number of equity and inequity constraints, respectively.</p><p>x ⊆ R n is the decision space, t is the discrete time instance defined as t = (1/n t ) (τ/τ t ) (where n t , τ t , and τ represent the severity of change, the frequency of change, and the iteration counter, respectively), and t ⊆ R is the time space. F(x, t) : x × t → R M is the objective function vector that evaluates the solution x at time t.</p><p>Most artificial DMOPs developed by researchers in the literature conform to Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. A distinct characteristic of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is that the POF and POS are susceptible to change, which challenges the tracking ability of DMOAs. Farina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> classified DMOPs into four types according to the dynamics of POF and POS.</p><p>1) Type I: The POS changes over time while the POF remains stationary. 2) Type II: Both POF and POS change over time.</p><p>3) Type III: The POF changes over time while the POS remains stationary. 4) Type IV: Both POF and POS remain stationary, although the objective function or constraints may change over time. Farina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> also created some FDA DMOPs by adapting the static problems from the DTLZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and ZDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> test suites. The FDA test suite has been widely used and further modified by researchers to test algorithms' performance. It should be noted that there is a misunderstanding of the FDA2 test problem. Helbig and Engelbrecht <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> studied the performance of several algorithms on FDA2, finding that all the tested algorithms lose track of the changing POF. However, the phenomenon of losing track of the changing POF they observed does not exist in FDA2 because the approximated POF would never be better than the true POF. Actually, their misleading results may come from a misunderstanding of the exact POS of FDA2 after a change.</p><p>Jin and Sendhoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> suggested a method for constructing DMOPs by dynamically changing the weights that aggregate the different objectives of static MOPs. But, their method does not provide clear defined problems. Guan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> studied DMOPs with objective replacement, where some objectives may be replaced with new objectives during the evolution. Mehnen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> argued that the DTLZ and ZDT test suites are already challenging in their static version, and simpler test functions are needed to analyze the effect of dynamics in DMOPs. Hence, they suggested the DSW functions for DMOPs. Furthermore, they proposed a new generic scheme DTF that is a generalized FDA function and allows the scaling of the complexity of the dynamic properties. They also added scalable and dynamic constraints to DMOPs by moving circular obstacles in the objective space.</p><p>The ZJZ problem defined by Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> is the first DMOP with variable linkages, which is a modified version of FDA1 but more challenging. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> further argued that most DMOPs derived from the FDA test suite are too simple, and the correlation between decision variables should be enhanced. Thus, they gave four new DMOP test instances that have nonlinear correlation between the decision variables. Helbig and Engelbrecht <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> made a sound investigation into the current DMOPs used in the literature, and identified their shortcomings: none of them had deceptive and isolated features in the POF. Then, they developed DMOPs with either an isolated or deceptive POF that follows the concept of the static WFG <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> test suite. In addition, they proposed some HE problems that have complicated POSs based on the MOPs of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Most existing DMOPs that have been discussed in the literature are included in the first three types of change mentioned earlier, but none of them is a type IV problem. Recently, Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> created several type IV problems by implying that the current found POS may further affect the following POS or POF. Furthermore, they introduced two DMOPs where the number of decision variables or objective functions changes over time.</p><p>Most recently, Biswas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> discussed some ways of designing DMOPs and proposed some general techniques for introducing dynamisms into the POS and POF through shifting, shape variation, phase variation, and several other types. By extending the bound-constrained multiobjective testbed developed by Li and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, they suggested nine benchmark functions for DMO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROPOSED BENCHMARK GENERATOR AND TEST INSTANCES A. Proposed Benchmark Generator</head><p>The proposed benchmark generator is based on the following framework:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">JY : ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ min F(x, t) = ( f 1 (x, t), f 2 (x, t)) T f 1 (x, t) = (1+ g(x II , t))(h(x I )+ A t sin(W t πh(x I ))) α t f 2 (x, t) = (1+ g(x II , t))(1 -h(x I )+ A t sin(W t πh(x I ))) β t (2)</formula><p>where 0 ≤ h(x I ) ≤ 1, and x I and x II are subvectors of the decision vector x. A t and W t are two parameters to control the local shape of the POF, with A t adjusting the curvature and W t controlling the number of mixed convex and concave segments on the POF. A large value of W t causes the POF to have disconnected regions, while a small value produces a continuous POF. Here, W t is recommended to be an integer. α t and β t (α t &gt; 0, β t &gt; 0) are parameters that control the overall shape of the POF: when α t &gt; 1 and β t &gt; 1 or α t &lt; 1 and β t &lt; 1, the overall shape is convex or concave, respectively; when α t = β t = 1, the overall shape is linear; otherwise, the overall shape is mixed. g(x II , t) is a non-negative function, hindering algorithms from converging toward the true POF. The minimum of g(x II , t) is zero. Thus, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) can produce various POF geometries by properly configuring relevant parameters. Generally, the mathematical description of the continuous POF for Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f 1 α t 1 + f 1 β t 2 = 1 + 2A t sin ⎛ ⎜ ⎝Wtπ f 1 α t 1 -f 1 β t 2 + 1 2 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the values of A t and W t must enable Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) to be a continuous POF. To have a better understanding of the proposed generator, we denote</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F 1 = αt √ f 1 -βt √ f 2 and F 2 = αt √ f 1 + βt √ f 2 .</formula><p>This means that a clockwise rotation with an angle π/4 is made from the current coordinate axis. Then, Eq. (3) can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F 2 = 1 + 2A t sin W t π F 1 + 1 2 (4)</formula><p>where a sine wave is described if W t = 0 and A t = 0. Thus, the proposed generator has a wave-like geometry, containing both concave and convex regions. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates examples of POFs of JY with linear and nonlinear overall shapes.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Test Instances</head><p>In this paper, we concentrate on h(x I ) = x 1 , although we recognize that movement across the POF can be achieved by adjusting a number of variables, i.e., the use of rotation matrices for h(x I ) and the normalization of h(x I ). Below, we provide ten benchmark instances with detailed information for a number of types of changes in the environment.</p><p>JY1, as shown in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>), is a type I problem, where the POS changes over time in a regular pattern, with x i = G(t), ∀x i ∈ x II . It mainly tests the convergence speed and reactivity of an algorithm, and fast-convergence algorithms can easily solve this problem. The control of processing plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, where the POS varies in different timedependent scenarios and controllers are required to have a fast response speed, can be a corresponding real-world application of JY1. JY1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ min F(x, t) = ( f 1 (x, t), f 2 (x, t)) T f 1 (x, t) = (1 + g(x II , t))(x 1 + A t sin(W t π x 1 )) f 2 (x, t) = (1 + g(x II , t))(1 -x 1 + A t sin(W t π x 1 )) g(x II , t) = x i ∈x II (x i -G(t)) 2 , G(t) = sin(0.5πt) A(t) = 0.05, W(t) = 6 x I = (x 1 ) ∈ [0, 1], x II = (x 2 , . . . , x n ) ∈ [-1, 1] n-1 .</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">)<label>5</label></formula><p>JY2, as shown in Eq.

As a result, the POF, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, changes its shape over time [refer to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>)]. A similar real-world application is the electric power supply problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, where the objective functions oscillate among several optimization modes, resulting in the change of optimal solutions in real time.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">JY2 : ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ min F(x, t) = ( f 1 (x, t), f 2 (x, t)) T f 1 (x, t) = (1 + g(x II , t))(x 1 + A t sin(W t π x 1 )) f 2 (x, t) = (1 + g(x II , t))(1 -x 1 + A t sin(W t π x 1 )) g(x II , t) = x i ∈x II (x i -G(t)) 2 , G(t) = sin(0.5πt) A(t) = 0.05, W(t) = 6sin(0.5π(t -1)) x I = (x 1 ) ∈ [0, 1], x II = (x 2 , . . . , x n ) ∈ [-1, 1] n-1 .

The POF of JY3 is similar to that of JY2, and the POS is y 1 = |x 1 sin((2α + 0.5)πx 1 )|, α = 100sin 2 (0.5πt) , and y i = √ y i-1 , i = 2, . . . , n, meaning that each variable has different amount of change. The POS for variables x 1 and x 2 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, where the dependency between these two variables is nonmonotonic and becomes increasingly complicated as the time increases. Furthermore, the density of solutions also changes over time.

To the best of our knowledge, none of this kind of test function has been introduced into the family of DMOPs. In this paper, we propose such a problem that cyclically switches from types I to II, then to type III. Technically, this kind of problem is macroscopically a type II problem from the perspective of the whole period of changes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Discussion</head><p>Changing factors in real-world applications vary from problem to problem. Generally speaking, changing factors can be objective functions, decision variables, time-linkage, constraints, switch-mode changes, as revealed by the survey in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. As a consequence, real-life problems present various dynamic characteristics, such as time-changing POS and/or POF, disconnectivity, multimodality, undetectability, periodicity, and predictability. On the other hand, it is often hard or even impossible to use only a few artificial benchmarks to simulate all dynamic real-life problems as problems have a variety of mathematical definitions. Therefore, in this paper, the JY test problems are mainly aimed to imitate several representative dynamics of real-world applications instead of defining similar mathematical formulations, and these test problems have some dynamic properties in common with the referenced real-world examples. Although there is a lack of clear link that to what extent test problems reflect real-world scenarios, it is not trivial to use these test problems to test and improve the performance of DMOAs. After all, what if these test problems appear in real-world applications and algorithms struggle to handle them? In this sense, the test problems can serve as a useful tool to identify strengths and weaknesses of algorithms before these algorithms can be applied to real-world DMOPs. Nevertheless, the test problems are far from being realistic, and it is necessary to further investigate their relation to real-world applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PERFORMANCE METRICS</head><p>In this section, we present four performance metrics for DMO, which are spacing (S) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, maximum spread (MS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, inverted generational distance (IGD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, and our proposed robustness (R). The S and MS metrics are used to analyze algorithms' distribution and coverage, respectively. The IGD metric measures both distribution and proximity of an obtained approximation POF, thus a good IGD value implies that an algorithm performs well on spacing, coverage, and convergence simultaneously. To this end, we can use S, MS, and IGD to reveal algorithms' specific performance on different indicators. Besides, the robustness metric R is introduced to express the variability of an algorithm's performance over a number of changes in dynamic environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Schott's Spacing Metric</head><p>Schott <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> developed a metric with regard to the distribution of the discovered Pareto front, called the S metric. It measures how evenly the members in an approximated POF (denoted POF * ) obtained by an algorithm are distributed, and is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">S = 1 n POF * -1 n POF * i=1 (D i -D) 2 D = 1 n POF * n POF * i=1 D i (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>where D i is the Euclidean distance between the ith member in POF * and its nearest member in POF * . A method of extending the spacing metric to examine the performance of algorithms for DMOPs is to define the average time steps in a run, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">S = 1 T s T s t=1 S(t) (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">)</formula><p>where S(t) refers to the Schott's spacing metric at time instance t and is calculated just before the next change occurs, and T s is the number of time steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Maximum Spread</head><p>The MS, first introduced by Zitzler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, measures to what extent the extreme members in POF * has been reached. Goh and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proposed a modified version of MS by taking into account the proximity of POF * toward POF, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">MS = 1 M M k=1 ⎡ ⎣ min[POF k , POF * k ] -max[POF k , POF * k ] POF * k -POF * k ⎤ ⎦ 2 (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>where POF k and POF k is the maximum and minimum of the kth objective in POF, respectively. Similarly, POF * k and POF * k is the maximum and minimum of the kth objective in POF * , respectively.</p><p>A large value of MS indicates a good spread of POF * , and MS will have a value of one when POF * covers the whole POF. Sometimes, however, a high MS value can be deceptive. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> gives such an example, where POF * is far from POF, and MS equals one since min</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">[POF k , POF * k ] is smaller than max[POF k , POF * k ], k = 1, 2.</formula><p>In this case, the MS is not justifiable and may cause a misleading understanding of the approximated POF * . For this reason, we propose a revised MS (RMS) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">RMS = 1 M M k=1 ⎡ ⎣ μ L POF * k , POF * k POF k , POF k μ L POF * k , POF * k ⎤ ⎦ 2 (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_37">)</formula><p>where μ L (A) represents the Lebesgue measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> of the set A. Let us consider again the example illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>, by computing RMS, we can get RMS = 0. This is reasonable since the approximated POF * does not converge well, not to mention spread widely over the POF. In order to apply the RMS metric to evaluate the performance of algorithms for DMOPs, an alternative method is to calculate the average of the RMS values over T s time steps, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">RMS = 1 T s T s t=1 RMS(t)<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where RMS(t) represents the RMS value at time instance t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Inverted Generational Distance</head><p>The IGD metric in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> measures both convergence and diversity of found solutions by an algorithm. Let POF be a set of uniformly distributed points in the true POF, and POF * be an approximation of the POF. The IGD is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">IGD = n POF i=1 d i n POF (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">)</formula><p>where n POF = POF , d i is the Euclidean distance between the ith member in POF and its nearest member in POF * . To have a low IGD value, POF * must be very close to POF and cannot miss any part of the whole POF. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> modified the IGD metric and adopted the average of the IGD values in some time steps over a run as a performance indicator for DMO, which is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">IGD = 1 T s T s t=1 IGD(t) (<label>23</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">)</formula><p>where IGD(t) refers to the IGD metric at time instance t and is calculated just before the next change occurs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Robustness</head><p>In dynamic environments, it is desirable to make algorithms as robust as possible. In other words, algorithms must be able to resist changes and be immune to an amount of uncertainty and perturbation. There have been some studies on robustness performance for dynamic optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, showing that robustness is a quite important goal in dynamic environments. Besides, many existing performance measures are adapted from their static counterparts and may not be suitable for dynamic environments. For example, suppose that PM t (the smaller, the better) is a performance measure of population P t at time t, the average value of PM t over some time steps in a run is commonly used in dynamic optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. As a compact form of assessment, average values are helpful for measuring algorithms' performance, but it cannot reflect the robustness performance. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>, the dashed and solid curves, respectively, represent the performance of two algorithms. Both algorithms have the same or similar average values in terms of PM t , but the dashed is more robust than the other one, thus it is clear that the dashed achieves better performance on PM t .</p><p>In this paper, the robustness of an algorithm on PM t can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">R(PM) = 1 T s -1 T s t=1 PM t -PM 2 (24)</formula><p>where R(PM) denotes the robustness of the metric PM over T s time steps and PM is the average of PM values over T s time steps, i.e., PM = T s t=1 PM t /T s . A smaller value of R(PM) indicates a better robustness performance on the PM metric. Note that, PM can be any unary performance metric pertinent to the multiobjective optimization goals of proximity, diversity and distribution. With this definition of robustness, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>, the dashed algorithm will achieve better performance than the solid one in terms of robustness on the performance measure PM t .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Compared Algorithms and Parameter Settings</head><p>We consider six multiobjective optimization algorithms (MOEAs) from the literature and compare their performance on our proposed test suite to assess the property and difficulty of these benchmark functions. These algorithms are classified into two groups. The first group includes four well-known dynamic MOEAs: 1) dynamic multiobjective particle swarm optimization (DMOPSO) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>; 2) dynamic nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (DNSGA-II) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; 3) dynamic competitivecooperative coevolutionary algorithm (dCOEA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; and 4) population prediction strategy (PPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Each algorithm in this group has a mechanism of dealing with dynamism for dynamic optimization. Note that, there are two versions of DNSGA-II and DNSGA-II with randomly created solutions whenever a change occurs is adopted here. The second group includes two classic MOEAs: 1) strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II (SPEA2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and 2) MOEA based on decomposition (MOEA/D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, and they are high-performance algorithms for static multiobjective optimization. To handle dynamic environments, the algorithms of this group adopt the following strategy in our experiments: 10% randomly selected population members is re-evaluated for change detection, and the restart scheme is employed for change response. The parameter settings for all the tested algorithms are inherited from the referenced papers.</p><p>The experiments were conducted at different combinations of change severity levels and frequencies, i.e., (n t , τ t ) = (5, 10), <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>. To guarantee the fairness for all the tested algorithms, the total number of changes for problems JY1-JY10 was set to 20 during the evolution. Besides, 100 more generations were given to each algorithm before the first change to minimize the potential effect of static optimization. Thus, the total number of generations for running an algorithm was 100 + 20τ t . For each problem, the number of decision variables was set to 10, and each tested algorithm, with a population size of 100, was executed 30 runs, and the experimental results were recorded. The experimental comparison employs the four performance metrics mentioned in Section IV, and the IGD metric is selected as the indicator PM for the robustness metric. That is, we use R(IGD) to reflect the robustness performance of MOEAs for DMO. Furthermore, for the computation of the IGD metric, 500 uniformly-distributed points (using the kth nearest neighbor truncation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>) were sampled from the true POF at each time step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experimental Results</head><p>For each combination (n t , τ t ) of a test problem, we conducted the Wilcoxon rank-sum test <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> at the 0.05 significance level to judge whether the results of an algorithm are significantly different from those of another algorithm on each considered performance metric. An algorithm that outperforms most of the competitors will rank the first, and the one that outperforms the least will be assigned the worst rank. In case that several algorithms have the same number of outperformed algorithms, they share the same rank. After that, the average rank of an algorithm on the three combinations of a problem is calculated. As a result, for each problem, the algorithm with the smallest average rank value is further considered as the best, and the one with the second smallest average rank value takes the second place, and so on. Using this ranking method, the final rank of each algorithm under each performance metric for every test problem is indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, where ordering in the rank column is purely alphabetical. For a close inspection of differences between the compared algorithms on each metric, readers are referred to our supplementary material. It can be observed from the table that, on most of the test problems, dCOEA and MOEA/D obtain the best population distribution in their approximations. This performance might be attributed to the fact that, dCOEA employs a multipopulation strategy to keep diversity during the search and MOEA/D always keeps a set of well-diversified subproblems regardless of environmental changes. However, due to the use of the niche-sharing method to preserve diversity, dCOEA faces difficulties in distributing the population uniformly along the discontinuous POF components of JY4, and for the same reason, DMOPSO also faces this problem. MOEA/D has poor distribution performance on JY10 as it may require a long time to adapt to the change of problem type. It is not surprising that DNSGA-II achieves good distribution performance for JY5 and JY8 because their POS remains stationary, and when the POS is static, the optimization task is to adjust the distribution of solutions on the time-varying POFs, which is easy for crowding-distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> based DNSGA-II. It is understandable that DMOPSO and SPEA2 perform poorly on the majority of the test problems regarding the S metric due to the lack of diversity maintenance or diversity increase methods in the event of change.</p><p>Considering the RMS metric, we can see that dCOEA and MOEA/D are outperformed by the other algorithms for almost all the problems although they can achieve good distribution mentioned above. This can be explained by the fact that all the algorithms except dCOEA and MOEA/D explicitly or implicitly tend to reward boundary solutions, which may favor the coverage of an approximation. Notably, DMOPSO is always the top-performing algorithm because it prefers to choose boundary solutions as leaders since they are located at less crowded areas, thus naturally driving more solutions toward boundary regions.</p><p>The IGD metric reveals both diversity and convergence performance of an algorithm. It can be clearly seen that, dCOEA and MOEA/D are high-performing algorithms on the majority of the problems although their RMS values are not very competitive. S and IGD jointly indicate that dCOEA and MOEA/D track changing environments better than the other algorithms on these problems. Despite the fast convergence, MOEA/D seems ineffective for handling the time-varying nonmonotonic variable linkages of JY3, on which DNSGA-II performs the best. Besides, DNSGA-II also wins on JY5 and JY8 as both problems have static POS. JY2 and JY9 have very similar definitions except that JY9 involves a mixed type of change. On JY2, SPEA2 is the bottom performer, as indicated by its IGD rank. However, for the harder problem JY9, SPEA2 outperforms PPS, DMOPSO and DNSGA-II, and dCEOA and MOEA/D swap their ranks. This means, the increase of difficulty caused by the mixed type of change significantly influences those algorithms' performance. On the other hand, by comparing the IGD ranks between JY9 and JY10, randomness brings about great challenges to MOEA/D and PPS. Besides, the S, RMS, and IGD metrics together help compare the convergence ability of algorithms. For example, PPS is better than MOEA/D on JY3, and dCOEA is better than DNSGA-II on JY4.</p><p>The last indicator, i.e., R(IGD), illustrates the variability of the performance of the six algorithms under a number of changes. Generally, the R(IGD) rank of each algorithm is roughly consistent with the IGD rank. This is understandable because the computation of the robustness metric is based on the IGD metric. Despite that, robustness provides a way to break ties between algorithms when they perform similarly in terms of a metric, e.g., MOEA/D and dCOEA for JY1, DNSGA-II and SPEA2 for JY4, PPS and SPEA2 for JY6, and PPS and MOEA/D for JY8. In addition, R(IGD) gives an insight to the stability of response to environmental changes during the evolution. For example, for JY2, JY3, and JY6, although DNSGA-II on average tracks their changing POFs better than SPEA2, as indicated by IGD, R(IGD) shows that SPEA2 responses to changes more stably than DNSGA-II. Other examples of inconsistency between IGD and R(IGD) are MOEA/D and PPS for JY3 and JY8, DMOPSO and SPEA2 for JY4, DNSGA-II and dCOEA for JY6, MOEA/D and SPEA2 for JY7, and DMOPSO, PPS, and MOEA/D for JY5 and JY8. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref> shows the tracking of IGD values obtained by the six algorithms over the period from t = 0 to t = 2 for the first nine test problems. The IGD curve of JY10 is not plotted here because of its stochastic nature of change. The figure gives a close inspection of algorithms' tracking ability and robustness. More specifically, DNSGA-II tracks the environmental changes stably for JY3, JY5, and JY8, dCOEA shows fairly robust performance for JY1-JY4 and JY7, while MOEA/D performs well in terms of robustness for JY1, JY4, and JY9. This is consistent with the results of the R(IGD) ranking list shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>.</p><p>To have a better understanding of the tracking ability of these algorithms, we also plot the approximated POFs of JY2 and JY5 over a number of time steps in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">12</ref>, respectively. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>, dCOEA can approximate the POFs of JY2 very well, and at the beginning time steps PPS does not track the changing POFs well because the quality of history information stored by PPS is not high. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">12</ref> further shows the good tracking performance of several algorithms (i.e., DNSGA-II, PPS, and dCOEA for JY5).</p><p>Due to the page limit, we only list the impacts of timechanging multimodality, nonmonotonic variable-linkage, and frequency τ t and severity n t of change, which can be found in the supplementary material, in the following.</p><p>1) Generally, the performance of algorithms deteriorates when environments become tough (i.e., n t and/or τ t become smaller), and the effect of τ t is more obvious and severe than that of n t in this paper.</p><p>2) The time-varying multimodality significantly aggravates the performance of algorithms, resulting in a notable degradation in their tracking ability. 3) A comparison between JY3 and the ZJZ problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> reveals that nonmonotonic variable linkages pose great challenges to some algorithms so that the population coverage and convergence are negatively influenced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Limitations</head><p>In the DMO community, the mean of performance measure over particular time steps is widely adopted as it can present the performance of algorithms in a compact form. Despite its significance and success, the mean value for experimental analysis might have limitations if the considered performance measure contains outliers at a time step <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. For this reason, our used performance measures, i.e., S, RMS, and IGD, may be inaccurate, and other approaches, if exist, are needed to further verify conclusions based on these measures. However, besides measuring algorithms' stability over a number of changes, our proposed robustness can be also used as a tool to embody the impact of outliers on a performance measure, because it takes into account the variability of the performance measure values over different time steps. If there are outliers at a specific time step influencing the performance measure, the robust value will be large. This way, robustness provides additional information to justify the performance of algorithms, increasing the reliability of performance analysis. On the other hand, no performance measure is perfect, and standard performance metrics are urgently needed in the field of DMO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>An extensive study of the current DMOPs used to assess the performance of algorithms showed that there is a lack of standard test functions that could occur in real-world life for the DMO domain. The commonly used DMOPs are so simple that some characteristics are excluded, such as mixed convex/concave POF components, a more powerful diversityresistant structure in the problem, a nonmonotonic correlation between variables, and a mixed type of problem that can jump between different types in a regular or random pattern.</p><p>To address the above shortcomings, this paper presents a generic scheme to generate desired benchmark functions that can compare the performance of different DMOAs. Furthermore, six representative MOEAs were tested on ten test instances generated by the benchmark generator and the results were evaluated by several performance metrics, including two new performance metrics proposed in this paper. The comparison among these algorithms shows that the proposed test instances are effective and can help to clearly distinguish the performance of each algorithm through proper statistical testing.</p><p>The key findings from the empirical study are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) Fast converging algorithms, i.e., MOEA/D and dCOEA, can adapt quickly to changing environments, thus they may have advantages in dealing with DMOPs.</p><p>2) The lack of diversity maintenance brings about severe consequences to algorithms like DMOPSO and SPEA2 in dynamic environments. DNSGA-II, dCOEA, and MOEA/D performs very well regarding the spacing metric because they successfully maintain good population diversity during the evolution.</p><p>3) The modified MS helps assess algorithms' coverage over the POF. Niche sharing (DMOPSO) and crowding distance (DNSGA-II) tend to reward boundary solutions, thus the MS of algorithms with those schemes is roughly good. 4) Nonmonotonic variable linkages are significantly harder than monotonic ones. Time-changing multimodality (JY6) is more challenging than static multimodality. Besides, the mixed type of change (JY9) complicates dynamic environments and randomness (JY10) in type of change further challenges algorithms' performance. 5) Robustness is another important performance indicator for DMO, which helps to have a comprehensive assessment of algorithms' performance. The experimental results have shown that, when several algorithms achieve similar values on a performance metric and there is no statistically significant difference among them, the proposed robustness performance measure can provide additional information to distinguish their performance. This is really helpful for a better understanding and comparison of algorithms' performance. The significance of this new indicator can be even clearer when a stable and high-performance transient response to an environmental change is pursued. Despite that our proposed benchmark generator can produce a series of features that are rarely tested in the literature, further research is needed regarding how to extend the generator to many-objective problems where the number of objectives is easy to scale up. Besides, this paper focuses mainly on comparing the performance of existing different metaheuristics for DMO. It is greatly needed to design new and robust MOEAs that can handle various environmental changes. These issues will be left for further discussions in our future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.</head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
