<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the past decade, solving constrained optimization problems with swarm algorithms has received considerable attention among researchers and practitioners. In this paper, a novel swarm algorithm called the Social Spider Optimization (SSO-C) is proposed for solving constrained optimization tasks. The SSO-C algorithm is based on the simulation of cooperative behavior of social-spiders. In the proposed algorithm, individuals emulate a group of spiders which interact to each other based on the biological laws of the cooperative colony. The algorithm considers two different search agents (spiders): males and females. Depending on gender, each individual is conducted by a set of different evolutionary operators which mimic different cooperative behaviors that are typically found in the colony. For constraint handling, the proposed algorithm incorporates the combination of two different paradigms in order to direct the search towards feasible regions of the search space. In particular, it has been added: (1) a penalty function which introduces a tendency term into the original objective function to penalize constraint violations in order to solve a constrained problem as an unconstrained one; (2) a feasibility criterion to bias the generation of new individuals toward feasible regions increasing also their probability of getting better solutions. In order to illustrate the proficiency and robustness of the proposed approach, it is compared to other well-known evolutionary methods. Simulation and comparisons based on several well-studied benchmarks functions and real-world engineering problems demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and stability of the proposed method.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The collective intelligent behavior of insect or animal groups in nature such as flocks of birds, colonies of ants, schools of fish, swarms of bees and termites have attracted the attention of researchers. The aggregative conduct of insects or animals is known as swarm behavior. Entomologists have studied this collective phenomenon to model biological swarms while engineers have applied these models as a framework for solving complex real-world problems. This branch of artificial intelligence which deals with the collective behavior of swarms through complex interaction of individuals with no supervision is frequently addressed as swarm intelligence. Bonabeau defined swarm intelligence as ""any attempt to design algorithms or distributed problem solving devices inspired by the collective behavior of the social insect colonies and other animal societies" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Swarm intelligence has some advantages such as scalability, fault tolerance, adaptation, speed, modularity, autonomy and parallelism <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The key components of swarm intelligence are self-organization and labor division. In a self-organizing system, each of the covered units responds to local stimuli individually and may act together to accomplish a global task, via a labor separation which avoids a centralized supervision. The entire system can thus efficiently adapt to internal and external changes.</p><p>Several swarm algorithms have been developed by a combination of deterministic rules and randomness, mimicking the behavior of insect or animal groups in nature. Such methods include the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling such as the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the cooperative behavior of bee colonies such as the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the social foraging behavior of bacteria such as the Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the simulation of the herding behavior of krill individuals such as the Krill Herd (KH) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the mating behavior of firefly insects such as the Firefly (FF) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the emulation of the lifestyle of cuckoo birds such as the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In particular, insect colonies and animal groups provide a rich set of metaphors for designing swarm optimization algorithms. Such cooperative entities are complex systems that are composed by individuals with different cooperative-tasks where each member tends to reproduce specialized behaviors depending on its gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, most of swarm algorithms model individuals as unisex entities that perform virtually the same behavior. Under such circumstances, algorithms waste the possibility of adding new and selective operators as a result of considering individuals with different characteristics such as sex, task-responsibility, etc. These operators could incorporate computational mechanisms to improve several important algorithm characteristics including population diversity and searching capacities.</p><p>Although PSO and ABC are the most popular swarm algorithms for solving complex optimization problems, they present serious flaws such as premature convergence and difficulty to overcome local minima <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. The cause for such problems is associated to the operators that modify individual positions. In such algorithms, during their evolution, the position of each agent for the next iteration is updated yielding an attraction towards the position of the best particle seen so-far (in case of PSO) or towards other randomly chosen individuals (in case of ABC). As the algorithm evolves, those behaviors cause that the entire population concentrates around the best particle or diverges without control. It does favors the premature convergence or damage the exploration-exploitation balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>The interesting and exotic collective behavior of social insects have fascinated and attracted researchers for many years. The collaborative swarming behavior observed in these groups provides survival advantages, where insect aggregations of relatively simple and "unintelligent" individuals can accomplish very complex tasks using only limited local information and simple rules of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Social-spiders are a representative example of social insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. A social-spider is a spider species whose members maintain a set of complex cooperative behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Whereas most spiders are solitary and even aggressive toward other members of their own species, social-spiders show a tendency to live in groups, forming long-lasting aggregations often referred to as colonies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In a social-spider colony, each member, depending on its gender, executes a variety of tasks such as predation, mating, web design, and social interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The web it is an important part of the colony because it is not only used as a common environment for all members, but also as a communication channel among them <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> Therefore, important information (such as trapped prays or mating possibilities) is transmitted by small vibrations through the web. Such information, considered as a local knowledge, is employed by each member to conduct its own cooperative behavior, influencing simultaneously the social regulation of the colony <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, in real-world applications, most optimization problems are subject to different types of constraints. These kinds of problems are known as constrained optimization problems. A constrained optimization problem is defined as finding parameter vector x that minimizes an objective function () J x subject to inequality and/or equality constraints: minimize ()</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">J x , 1 ( , , ) n n xx  xR , iii l x u  1, , in  subject to: ( ) 0 j g  x for 1, , jq  ( ) 0 j h  x for 1, , j q m <label>(1)</label></formula><p>The objective function J is defined on a search space, S, which is defined as a n-dimensional rectangle in R (  SR ). Domains of variables are defined by their lower and upper bounds ( i l and i u ). A feasible region  FS is defined by a set of m additional constraints (m≥0) and x is defined on feasible space (  x F S ). At any point  xF , constraints j g that satisfy</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ) 0 j g  x</formula><p>are called active constraints at x . By extension, equality constraints j h are also called active at all points of S <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Constrained optimization problems are hard to optimization algorithms and also no single parameter (number of linear, nonlinear and active constraints, the ratio / ρ  FS , type of the function, number of variables) is proved to be significant as a major measure of difficulty of the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Since most of the optimization algorithms have been primarily designed to address unconstrained optimization problems, constraint handling techniques are usually incorporated in the algorithms in order to direct the search towards the feasible regions of the search space. Methods dealing with the constraints were grouped into four categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>: (i) methods based on preserving feasibility of solutions by transforming infeasible solutions to feasible ones with some operators; (ii) methods based on penalty functions which introduce a penalty term into the original objective function to penalize constraint violations in order to solve a constrained problem as an unconstrained one; (iii) methods that make a clear distinction between feasible and infeasible solutions; (iv) other hybrid methods combining evolutionary computation techniques with deterministic procedures for numerical optimization. Considering such mechanisms, several swarm algorithms have been modified to solve constrained optimization problems. Such methods include modified versions of PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, ABC <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and FF <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Each one of the four approaches employed to deal constrains presents advantages such as implementation-easiness and fast calculation whereas adversely posses disadvantages such as tuning difficulties and increase of function evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Therefore, it is reasonable to incorporate a combination of these approaches into a single algorithm in order to increase their potential and to eliminate their drawbacks.</p><p>In this paper, a novel swarm algorithm, called the Social Spider Optimization (SSO-C) is proposed for solving constrained optimization tasks. The SSO-C algorithm is based on the simulation of the cooperative behavior of social-spiders. In the proposed algorithm, individuals emulate a group of spiders which interact to each other based on the biological laws of the cooperative colony. The algorithm considers two different search agents (spiders): males and females. Depending on gender, each individual is conducted by a set of different evolutionary operators which mimic different cooperative behaviors that are typical in a colony. For constraint handling, the proposed algorithm incorporates the combination of two different paradigms in order to direct the search towards feasible regions of the search space. In particular, it has been added: (1) a penalty function which introduces a tendency term into the original objective function to penalize constraint violations in order to solve a constrained problem as an unconstrained one; (2) a feasibility criterion to bias the generation of new individuals toward feasible regions increasing also their probability of getting better solutions. Different to most of existent swarm algorithms, in the proposed approach, each individual is modeled considering two genders. Such fact allows not only to emulate in a better realistic way the cooperative behavior of the colony, but also to incorporate computational mechanisms to avoid critical flaws commonly present in the popular PSO and ABC algorithms, such as the premature convergence and the incorrect exploration-exploitation balance. In order to illustrate the proficiency and robustness of the proposed approach, it is compared to other similar methods. The comparison examines several standard constrained benchmark functions which are commonly considered in the literature. The results show a high performance of the proposed method for searching a global optimum in several benchmark functions and real-world engineering problems. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce basic biological aspects of the algorithm. In Section 3, the novel SSO-C algorithm and its characteristics are both described. Section 4 presents the experimental results and the comparative study. Finally, in Section 5, conclusions are drawn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Biological fundamentals</head><p>Social insect societies are complex cooperative systems that self-organize within a set of constraints. Cooperative groups are better at manipulating and exploiting their environment, defending resources and brood, and allowing task specialization among group members <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. A social insect colony functions as an integrated unit that not only possesses the ability to operate at a distributed manner, but also to undertake enormous construction of global projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. It is important to acknowledge that global order in social insects can arise as a result of internal interactions among members.</p><p>A few species of spiders have been documented exhibiting a degree of social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The behavior of spiders can be generalized into two basic forms: solitary spiders and social spiders <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This classification is made based on the level of cooperative behavior that they exhibit <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In one side, solitary spiders create and maintain their own web while live in scarce contact to other individuals of the same species. In contrast, social spiders form colonies that remain together over a communal web with close spatial relationship to other group members <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents two pictures that show different environments formed by the social spider. A social spider colony is composed of two fundamental components: its members and the communal web.</p><p>Members are divided into two different categories: males and females. An interesting characteristic of socialspiders is the highly female-biased population. Some studies suggest that the number of male spiders barely reaches the 30% of the total colony members <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. In the colony, each member, depending on its gender, cooperate in different activities such as building and maintaining the communal web, prey capturing, mating and social contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Interactions among members are either direct or indirect <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Direct interactions imply body contact or the exchange of fluids such as mating. For indirect interactions, the communal web is used as a "medium of communication" which conveys important information that is available to each colony member <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This information encoded as small vibrations is a critical aspect for the collective coordination among members <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Vibrations are employed by the colony members to decode several messages such as the size of the trapped preys, characteristics of the neighboring members, etc. The intensity of such vibrations depend on the weight and distance of the spiders that have produced them.</p><p>In spite of the complexity, all the cooperative global patterns in the colony level are generated as a result of internal interactions among colony members <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Such internal interactions involve a set of simple behavioral rules followed by each spider in the colony. Behavioral rules are divided into two different classes: social interaction (cooperative behavior) and mating <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>As a social insect, spiders perform cooperative interaction with other colony members. The way in which this behavior takes place depends on the spider gender. Female spiders which show a major tendency to socialize present an attraction or dislike over others, irrespectively of gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For a particular female spider, such attraction or dislike is commonly developed over other spiders according to their vibrations which are emitted over the communal web and represent strong colony members <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Since the vibrations depend on the weight and distance of the members which provoke them, stronger vibrations are produced either by big spiders or neighboring members <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The bigger a spider is, the better it is considered as a colony member. The final decision of attraction or dislike over a determined member is taken according to an internal state which is influenced by several factors such as reproduction cycle, curiosity and other random phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Different to female spiders, the behavior of male members is reproductive-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Male spiders recognize themselves as a subgroup of alpha males which dominate the colony resources. Therefore, the male population is divided into two classes: dominant and non-dominant male spiders <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Dominant male spiders have better fitness characteristics (normally size) in comparison to non-dominant. In a typical behavior, dominant males are attracted to the closest female spider in the communal web. In contrast, non-dominant male spiders tend to concentrate upon the center of the male population as a strategy to take advantage of the resources wasted by dominant males <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Mating is an important operation that no only assures the colony survival, but also allows the information exchange among members. Mating in a social-spider colony is performed by dominant males and female members <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Under such circumstances, when a dominant male spider locates one or more female members within a specific range, it mates with all the females in order to produce offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Social Spider Optimization (SSO-C) algorithm</head><p>In this paper, the operational principles from the social-spider colony have been used as guidelines for developing a new swarm optimization algorithm. The SSO-C assumes that entire search space is a communal web, where all the social-spiders interact to each other. In the proposed approach, each solution within the search space represents a spider position in the communal web. Every spider receives a weight according to the fitness value of the solution that is symbolized by the social-spider. The algorithm models two different search agents (spiders): males and females. Depending on gender, each individual is conducted by a set of different evolutionary operators which mimic different cooperative behaviors that are commonly assumed within the colony.</p><p>An interesting characteristic of social-spiders is the highly female-biased populations. In order to emulate this fact, the algorithm starts by defining the number of female and male spiders that will be characterized as individuals in the search space. The number of females f N is randomly selected within the range of 65% - 90% of the entire population N. Therefore, f N is calculated by the following equation:</p><p>  floor (0.9 rand 0.25)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f NN     (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where rand is a random number between [0,1] whereas floor( )  maps a real number to an integer number. The number of male spiders m N is computed as the complement between N and f N . It is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">mf N N N <label>(3)</label></formula><p>Therefore, the complete population S, composed by N elements, is divided in two sub-groups F and M. The Group F assembles the set of female individuals ( 12 { , , , }</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f N  F f f f ) whereas M groups the male members ( 12 { , , , } m N  M m m m ), where  S F M (   12 , , , N  S s s s ), such that   1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 , ,<label>, , , , ,</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">f f f f m N N N N N N         S s f s f s f s m s m s m .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Penalty function and substituted function</head><p>Since the proposed approach aims to solve constrained optimization problems, the original objective function ()  <ref type="figure">P</ref> x that introduces a tendency term to penalize constraint violations produced by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">J</formula><p>x.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Fitness assignation</head><p>In the biological metaphor, the spider size is the characteristic that evaluates the individual capacity to perform better over its assigned tasks. In the proposed approach, every individual (spider) receives a weight i w which represents the solution quality that corresponds to the spider i (irrespective of gender) of the population S. In order to calculate the weight of every spider the next equation is used:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">() i worst C w worst best    S SS s<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where () i C s is the fitness value obtained by the evaluation of the spider position i s with regard to the substituted objective function () C  .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Modeling of the vibrations through the communal web</head><p>The communal web is used as a mechanism to transmit information among the colony members. This information is encoded as small vibrations that are critical for the collective coordination of all individuals in the population. The vibrations depend on the weight and distance of the spider which has generated them. Since the distance is relative to the individual that provokes the vibrations and the member who detects them, members located near to the individual that provokes the vibrations, perceive stronger vibrations in comparison with members located in distant positions. In order to reproduce this process, the vibrations perceived by the individual i as a result of the information transmitted by the member j are modeled according to the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">2 , , ij d i j j Vib w e  <label>(7)</label></formula><p>where the , ij d is the Euclidian distance between the spiders i and j, such that ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">i j i j d  ss.</formula><p>Although it is virtually possible to compute perceived-vibrations by considering any pair of individuals, three special relationships are considered within the SSO-C approach:</p><p>1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Initializing the population</head><p>Like other evolutionary algorithms, the SSO-C is an iterative process whose first step is to randomly initialize the entire population (female and male). The algorithm begins by initializing the set S of N spider positions. Each spider position, i f or i m , is a n-dimensional vector containing the parameter values to be optimized. Such values are randomly and uniformly distributed between the pre-specified lower initial parameter bound low j p and the upper initial parameter bound high j p , just as it described by the following expressions: 0 , rand(0,1) ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">low high low i j j j j f p p p     1, 2, , ; 1, 2, , f i N j n  0 ,</formula><p>rand(0,1) ( ) </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">low high low k j j j j m p p p     1, 2, , ; 1, 2, ,</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Female cooperative operator</head><p>Social-spiders perform cooperative interaction over other colony members. The way in which this behavior takes place depends on the spider gender. Female spiders present an attraction or dislike over others irrespective of gender. For a particular female spider, such attraction or dislike is commonly developed over other spiders according to their vibrations which are emitted over the communal web. Since vibrations depend on the weight and distance of the members which have originated them, strong vibrations are produced either by big spiders or other neighboring members lying nearby the individual which is perceiving them. The final decision of attraction or dislike over a determined member is taken considering an internal state which is influenced by several factors such as reproduction cycle, curiosity and other random phenomena.</p><p>In order to emulate the cooperative behavior of the female spider, a new operator is defined. The operator considers the position change of the female spider i at each iteration. Such position change, which can be of attraction or repulsion, is computed as a combination of three different elements. The first one involves the change in regard to the nearest member to i that holds a higher weight and produces the vibration i Vibc . The second one considers the change regarding the best individual of the entire population S who produces the vibration i Vibb . Finally, the third one incorporates a random movement.</p><p>Since the final movement of attraction or repulsion depends on several random phenomena, the selection is modeled as a stochastic decision. For this operation, a uniform random number m r is generated within the range [0,1]. If m r is smaller than a threshold PF, an attraction movement is generated; otherwise, a repulsion movement is produced. Therefore, such operator can be modeled as follows: where  ,  ,  and rand are random numbers between [0,1] whereas k represents the iteration number. The individual c s and b s represent the nearest member to i that holds a higher weight and the best individual of the entire population S, respectively. Under this operation, each particle presents a movement which combines the past position that holds the attraction or repulsion vector over the local best element c s and the global best individual b s seen so-far. This particular type of interaction avoids the quick concentration of particles at only one point and encourages each particle to search around the local candidate region within its neighborhood ( c s ), rather than interacting to a particle ( b s ) in a distant region of the domain. The use of this scheme has two advantages. First, it prevents the particles from moving towards the global best position, making the algorithm less susceptible to premature convergence. Second, it encourages particles to explore their own neighborhood thoroughly before converging towards the global best position. Therefore, it provides the algorithm with global search ability and enhances the exploitative behavior of the proposed approach.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">1 1 ( ) ( ) (rand ) with probability 2 1 ( ) ( ) (rand ) with probability 1- 2 k k k i i c i i b i k i k k k i i c i i b i Vibc Vibb PF Vibc Vibb PF                                      f s f s f f f s f s f<label>(12)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Male cooperative operator</head><p>According to the biological behavior of the social-spider, male population is divided into two classes: dominant and non-dominant male spiders. Dominant male spiders have better fitness characteristics (usually regarding the size) in comparison to non-dominant. Dominant males are attracted to the closest female spider in the communal web. In contrast, non-dominant male spiders tend to concentrate in the center of the male population as a strategy to take advantage of resources that are wasted by dominant males.</p><p>For emulating such cooperative behavior, the male members are divided into two different groups (dominant members D and non-dominant members ND) according to their position with regard to the median member. Male members, with a weight value above the median value within the male population, are considered the dominant individuals D. On the other hand, those under the median value are labeled as non-dominant ND males. In order to implement such computation, the male population M ( According to this, change of positions for the male spider can be modeled as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">1 1 1 1 ( ) (rand ) if 2 if ff m f ff m f kk i i f i N i N m k N k i h N h h kk i i N i N m N Nh h Vibf w w w ww w                                       m s m m m mm , (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where the individual f s represents the nearest female individual to the male member i whereas</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">  11 / mm ff NN k h N h N h hh ww     m</formula><p>correspond to the weighted mean of the male population M.</p><p>By using this operator, two different behaviors are produced. First, the set D of particles is attracted to others in order to provoke mating. Such behavior allows incorporating diversity into the population. Second, the set ND of particles is attracted to the weighted mean of the male population M. This fact is used to partially control the search process according to the average performance of a sub-group of the population. Such mechanism acts as a filter which avoids that very good individuals or extremely bad individuals influence the search process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.6">Mating operator</head><p>Mating in a social-spider colony is performed by dominant males and the female members. Under such circumstances, when a dominant male g m spider ( g  D ) locates a set g E of female members within a specific range r (range of mating), it mates, forming a new brood new s which is generated considering all the elements of the set g T that, in turn, has been generated by the union g g  Em . It is important to emphasize that if the set g E is empty, the mating operation is canceled. The range r is defined as a radius which depends on the size of the search space. Such radius r is computed according to the following model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">1 () 2 n high low jj j pp r n     <label>(14)</label></formula><p>In the mating process, the weight of each involved spider (elements of g T ) defines the probability of influence for each individual into the new brood. The spiders holding a heavier weight are more likely to influence the new product, while elements with lighter weight have a lower probability. The influence probability i Ps of each member is assigned by the roulette method, which is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">k i i j j w Ps w    T ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">g i  T .</formula><p>Once the new spider new s is formed, it is compared to the spider wo s holding the worst weight of the colony, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">  1,2, ,<label>min ( )</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">wo l lN ww  </formula><p>. In order to direct the search towards feasible regions of the search space, a feasibility criterion is incorporated to bias the generation of new spiders toward feasible regions increasing also their probability of getting better solutions. Such feasibility criterion allows choosing one of two different solutions ( new s or wo s ) applying the two following rules:</p><p>• Between new s and wo s , it is chosen the spider whose penalty function P(s) present the lower value. Therefore, it is selected new s , if ( ( ) ( )) In case of new s would be selected, the new spider new s assumes the gender and index from the replaced spider wo s . Such fact assures that the entire population S maintains the original rate between female and male members.</p><p>In order to demonstrate the mating operation, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref> illustrates a simple optimization problem which can be stated as follows: minimize, ()</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">4 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 ( ) 2 2 4 J x x x x x x x       x subject to: 1 24 x    2 24 x    22 12 ( ) 0.25 0.75 1 0 g x x     x 22 12 ( ) 2 0 h x x     x<label>(16)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">g x () h x ( ) 0 g  x 1 f 1 m 2 m 3 m 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f r 2 T new s () g x () h x ( ) 0 g  x 1 f 1 m 2 m 3 m 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f<label>12</label></formula><p>As an example, it is assumed a population S of eight different 2-dimensional members (N=8), five females ( 5 f N  ) and three males ( 3 m N  ).

Then, the new candidate spider new s is generated from the elements 2 f , 4 f and 2 m which constitute the set 2 T . Therefore, the value of the first decision variable ,, f f m . The value of the second decision variable ,2 new s is also chosen in the same manner.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the data for constructing the new spider through the roulette method. Once the new spider new s is formed, the feasibility criterion is applied, considering the worst member 5 f that is present in the population S.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.8.">Discussion about the SSO-C algorithm</head><p>Evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been widely employed for solving complex optimization problems. These methods are found to be more powerful than conventional methods based on formal logics or mathematical programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In an EA algorithm, search agents have to decide whether to explore unknown search positions or to exploit already tested positions in order to improve their solution quality. Pure exploration degrades the precision of the evolutionary process but increases its capacity to find new potential solutions.</p><p>On the other hand, pure exploitation allows refining existent solutions but adversely drives the process to local optimal solutions. Therefore, the ability of an EA to find a global optimal solution depends on its capacity to find a good balance between the exploitation of found-so-far elements and the exploration of the search space <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. So far, the exploration-exploitation dilemma has been an unsolved issue within the framework of evolutionary algorithms.</p><p>EA defines individuals with the same property, performing virtually the same behavior. Under these circumstances, algorithms waste the possibility to add new and selective operators as a result of considering individuals with different characteristics. These operators could incorporate computational mechanisms to improve several important algorithm characteristics such as population diversity or searching capacities.</p><p>On the other hand, PSO and ABC are the most popular swarm algorithms for solving complex optimization problems. However, they present serious flaws such as premature convergence and difficulty to overcome local minima <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Such problems arise from operators that modify individual positions. In such algorithms, the position of each agent in the next iteration is updated yielding an attraction towards the position of the best particle seen so-far (in case of PSO) or any other randomly chosen individual (in case of ABC). Such behaviors produce that the entire population concentrates around the best particle or diverges without control as the algorithm evolves, either favoring the premature convergence or damaging the exploration-exploitation balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Different to other EA, at SSO-C each individual is modeled considering the gender. Such fact allows incorporating computational mechanisms to avoid critical flaws such as premature convergence and incorrect exploration-exploitation balance commonly present in both, the PSO and the ABC algorithm. From an optimization point of view, the use of the social-spider behavior as a metaphor introduces interesting concepts in EA: the fact of dividing the entire population into different search-agent categories and the employment of specialized operators that are applied selectively to each of them. By using this framework, it is possible to improve the balance between exploitation and exploration, yet preserving the same population, i.e. individuals who have achieved efficient exploration (female spiders) and individuals that verify extensive exploitation (male spiders). Furthermore, the social-spider behavior mechanism introduces an interesting computational scheme with three important particularities: first, individuals are separately processed according to their characteristics. Second, operators share the same communication mechanism allowing the employment of important information of the evolutionary process to modify the influence of each operator. Third, although operators modify the position of only an individual type, they use global information (positions of all individual types) in order to perform such modification. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref> presents a schematic representation of the algorithm-data-flow. According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref>, the female cooperative and male cooperative operators process only female or male individuals, respectively. However, the mating operator modifies both individual types.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, a novel swarm algorithm, called the Social Spider Optimization (SSO-C) has been proposed for solving constrained optimization tasks. The SSO-C algorithm is based on the simulation of the cooperative behavior of social-spiders. In the proposed algorithm, individuals emulate a group of spiders which interact to each other based on the biological laws of the cooperative colony. The algorithm considers two different search agents (spiders): males and females. Depending on gender, each individual is conducted by a set of different evolutionary operators which mimic different cooperative behaviors that are typical in a colony.</p><p>For constraint handling, the proposed algorithm incorporates the combination of two different paradigms in order to direct the search towards feasible regions of the search space. In particular, it has been added: (1) a penalty function which introduces a tendency term into the original objective function to penalize constraint violations in order to solve a constrained problem as an unconstrained one; (2) a feasibility criterion to bias the generation of new individuals toward feasible regions increasing also their probability of getting better solutions.</p><p>In contrast to most of existent swarm algorithms, the proposed approach models each individual considering two genders. Such fact allows not only to emulate the cooperative behavior of the colony in a realistic way, but also to incorporate computational mechanisms to avoid critical flaws commonly delivered by the popular PSO and ABC algorithms, such as the premature convergence and the incorrect exploration-exploitation balance.</p><p>SSO-C has been experimentally tested considering a suite of 8 benchmark constrained functions and three real-word engineering problems. The performance of the proposed approach has been also compared to modified versions of PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, ABC <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and FF <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> which have been adapted to work over constrained optimization problems. Results have confirmed an acceptable performance of the proposed method in terms of the solution quality and stability.</p><p>The SSO"s remarkable performance is associated with three different reasons: (i) their operators allow a better particle distribution in the search space, increasing the algorithm"s ability to find the global optima; (ii) the division of the population into different individual types, provides the use of different rates between exploration and exploitation during the evolution process; and (iii) the constraint handling mechanism allows efficiently to conduct unfeasible solutions to feasible solutions even when new individuals are generated. </p></div>
