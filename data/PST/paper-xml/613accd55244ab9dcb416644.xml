<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance on graph-based tasks. The key idea for GNNs is to obtain informative representation through aggregating information from local neighborhoods. However, it remains an open question whether the neighborhood information is adequately aggregated for learning representations of nodes with few neighbors. To address this, we propose a simple and efficient data augmentation strategy, local augmentation, to learn the distribution of the node representations of the neighbors conditioned on the central node's representation and enhance GNN's expressive power with generated features. Local augmentation is a general framework that can be applied to any GNN model in a plug-and-play manner. It samples feature vectors associated with each node from the learned conditional distribution as additional input for the backbone model at each training iteration. Extensive experiments and analyses show that local augmentation consistently yields performance improvement when applied to various GNN architectures across a diverse set of benchmarks. For example, experiments show that plugging in local augmentation to GCN and GAT improves by an average of 3.4% and 1.6% in terms of test accuracy on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. Besides, our experimental results on large graphs (OGB) show that our model consistently improves performance over backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/ SongtaoLiu0823/LAGNN.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kipf &amp; Welling, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hamilton et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Veličković et al., 2018)</ref> have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of graph-based tasks, including recommendation system <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ying et al., 2018)</ref>, drug discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dai et al., 2019)</ref> and traffic prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Guo et al., 2019)</ref>. The core of GNNs is to employ a message-passing mechanism that passes and aggregates information from the local neighborhood to generate informative representations.</p><p>Recent development of deep GNNs, such as JKnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Xu et al., 2018)</ref>, GCNII <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2020b)</ref>, and RevGNN-Deep <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Li et al., 2021)</ref> adds the output of shallow layers to the deep layers with a residual-style design, to preserve the locality information of node representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2020b)</ref>. Moreover, recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Zeng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Zhang &amp; Li, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wijesinghe &amp; Wang, 2022)</ref> utilize structural information of the local neighborhood to design efficient message-passing aggregation schemes to enhance the expressive power of GNNs. These works demonstrate that local information plays a significant role in training GNN models and designing powerful GNNs.</p><p>Despite advances of GNNs in learning node representations from the local neighborhood, it remains an open problem whether the local neighborhood information is sufficient to obtain effective node representations, especially for nodes with limited number of neighbors. We argue that the limited number of neighbors in the local neighborhood restricts the expressive power of GNNs and hinders their performance, especially in sample-starving cases where some nodes have very few neighbors. Stacking graph layers to enlarge the receptive field can incorporate multi-hop neighboring information but leads to over-smoothing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Li et al., 2018)</ref> without residual connection to the input, and is not a direct solution to address this issue. Existing works on GNN model architecture cannot tackle the problem that the very limited neighbors are unfavorable to learning node representations. Therefore, here we focus on enriching the local information for low-degree nodes to obtain effective representations.</p><p>One promising solution is to generate more samples in the local neighborhood via data augmentation. Data augmentation has been well-studied in computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Shorten &amp; Khoshgoftaar, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cubuk et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zhao et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dong et al., 2022)</ref> and natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fadaee et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">S ¸ahin &amp; Steedman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Xia et al., 2019)</ref>, but remains under-explored on graph-structured data. Existing graph data augmentation approaches only perturb at the topology-level and feature-level from a global perspective, which can be divided into two categories: topology-level augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rong et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhao et al., 2021)</ref> and feature-level augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Deng et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Feng et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kong et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fang et al., 2021)</ref>. Topology-level augmentation perturbs the adjacency matrix, yielding different graph structures. On the other hand, existing featurelevel augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Deng et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Feng et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kong et al., 2020)</ref> exploits perturbation of node attributes guided by adversarial training to boost generalization. These augmentation techniques have a prominent drawback: they focus on global augmentation concerning the properties of the whole distribution of the graph rather than a single node, and neglect the local information of the neighborhood.</p><p>Present Work. In this work, in order to promote the aggregation scheme with more generated samples in the local neighborhood, we propose a novel and efficient data augmentation framework: Local Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks (LA-GNNs). The term "local augmentation" refers to generating neighborhood features via a generative model conditioned on local structures and node features. Specifically, our proposed framework includes a pre-training step, which learns the conditional distribution of the connected neighbors' node features given one center node's features via a generative model. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we then exploit this distribution to generate feature vectors associated with this center node as additional input at each training iteration. Furthermore, we decouple the pre-training of the generative model and downstream GNN training, allowing our data augmentation model to be applied to any GNN model in a plug-and-play manner.</p><p>We verify the effectiveness of LAGNNs on three standard citation networks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) and Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hu et al., 2020)</ref>. Extensive experimental results on semi-supervised node classification show that our local augmentation achieves new stat-of-the-art performance: LAGCN and LAGAT achieve up to by an average of 3.4% and 1.6% in terms of test accuracy over GCN and GAT respectively on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. LAGNN also obtains superior performance on large-scale OGB datasets. We show that our model improves 1.7% and 0.2% of test accuracy on Pubmed for nodes with degrees in <ref type="bibr">[2, 5] and [6, 20]</ref> respectively. Besides, our local augmentation model outperforms other feature/topology-level augmentation models, such as G-GNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Zhu et al., 2020)</ref>, DropEdge <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rong et al., 2020)</ref>, GRAND <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Feng et al., 2020)</ref>, and GAUG <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zhao et al., 2021)</ref> on node classification tasks, which demonstrates the superiority of our model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Local Augmentation</head><p>Motivation. Existing GNNs focus on designing a message-passing scheme to exploit local information to obtain node representations. We explore a new direction in that we can generate more samples in the local neighborhood, especially for nodes with few neighbors, to enhance the expressive power of various GNNs. In order to produce more samples in a node v's neighborhood N v , we need to know the distribution of the node representation of its neighbors. As this distribution is related to the center node v, we can learn it conditioned on the center node's representation via a generative model. Approach. We exploit the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kingma &amp; Welling, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sohn et al., 2015)</ref> to learn the conditional distribution of the node features of connected neighbors u(u ∈ N v ) given the center node v. In our CVAE setting, we use X v as a condition since the distribution of X u (u ∈ N v ) is related to X v . Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sohn et al. (2015)</ref>, the latent variable z is generated from the prior distribution p θ (z|X v ) and the data X u is generated by the generative distribution p θ (X|X v , z) conditioned on z and X v : z ∼ p θ (z|X v ), X u ∼ p θ (X|X v , z v ). Let ϕ denote the variational parameters and θ represent the generative parameters, we have</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefits</head><formula xml:id="formula_5">log p θ (X u |X v ) = q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) log p θ (X u , z|X v ) q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) dz + KL (q ϕ (z|X u , X v )∥p θ (z|X u , X v )) ≥ q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) log p θ (X u , z|X v ) q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) dz,</formula><p>and the evidence lower bound (ELBO) can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L(X u , X v ; θ, ϕ) = − KL(q ϕ (z|X u , X v )∥p θ (z|X v )) + 1 L L l=1 log p θ (X u |X v , z (l) )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where z (l) = g ϕ (X v , X u , ϵ (l) ), ϵ (l) ∼ N (0, I) and L is the number of neighbors of node v. Note that as we have discussed before, we just train one CVAE for all nodes. In the training stage, the objective is to use the neighboring pairs (X v , X u , u ∈ N v ) as input to maximize the ELBO, i.e., Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">2</ref>). In the generation stage, we use the node feature X v as the condition and sample a latent variable z ∼ N (0, I) as input for the decoder. Then we can get generated feature vector X v associated with node v.</p><p>Discussion. When learning the distribution of the neighbors' feature conditioned on the central node, we do not consider the effect of other nodes connected to each neighbor on the neighbors' feature. If we regard the center node as a parent node, and its neighbors as the children nodes of the center node, then our assumption is similar to the Causal Markov Condition in a Bayesian network <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hausman &amp; Woodward, 1999)</ref>: the distribution of the neighbor's features is independent of its non-descendants given its parent node. This assumption is important and common in the literature of the probabilistic graphical model. The advantage is that this assumption avoids the exponential complexity of conditioning on multi-hop neighbors, significantly improving scalability. Our experimental results show that our method still achieves remarkable performance across all benchmarks, thanks to the expressive power of deep generative models (similar to how the assumption of variational inference does not limit the performance of deep VAEs in real datasets).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Decoupling the Generative Model Training from Downstream Graph Learning</head><p>Most existing GNN models follow the message passing mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gilmer et al., 2017)</ref> and can be regarded as a learned classification or regression function. In order to make predictions, GNN models need to estimate the posterior distribution P Θ (•|A, X) with respect to the graph structure A and feature matrix X. For example, • can be class labels Y on the node classification task. We can use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate the parameter Θ by optimizing the following likelihood function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">max i P Θ (•|A, X) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where i represents the i-th data point in the training dataset.</p><p>In our local augmentation model, in order to further improve the expressive power of GNNs, we introduce a generated feature vector X v for the center node v by using X v as input condition and sampling from the generative model. Let X denote the generated feature matrix where the j-th row corresponds to the generated feature vector X j . We incorporate X in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">3</ref>) and rewrite it as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">max i X P Θ •, X|A, X .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For Bayesian tractability, we decompose P Θ in Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">4</ref>) as a product of two posterior probabilities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P Θ,Φ (•, X|A, X) := P Θ (•|A, X, X)Q Φ (X|A, X),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where P Θ (•|A, X, X) and Q Φ (X|A, X) denote the probabilistic distributions approximated by the GNN models and the generative model respectively, parameterized by Θ and Φ. By doing this, we can decouple our proposed local augmentation and the specific graph learning, allowing our augmentation model to be applied to various GNN models with only one-time pre-training for the generative model. Therefore, local augmentation can be regarded as an unsupervised pre-training model prior to the GNN training. The representation power of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">5</ref>) is superior than that of a single predictor P Θ (Y k |A, X) since we provide GNN models with more generated samples in the local neighborhood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Architecture</head><p>In this section, we present the details of how to train GNNs with generated samples from our local augmentation model as additional input. To illustrate the effectiveness of our local augmentation model, we provide two different ways of exploiting our generated samples, leading to average and concatenation design of the architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LAGCN.</head><p>For GCN, we only make a small change on the first graph convolution layer with</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H (1) = σ P XW (1) 0 ∥σ P XW (1) 1 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P = D − 1 2 A D − 1 2 .</formula><p>The notation ∥ means concate- nation of the matrices on the second dimension.

In order not to change the parameter size of the GCN model, the sum of the second dimension of W</p><p>(1) 0</p><p>and W</p><p>(1) 1</p><p>is equal to the second dimension of W (1) of GCN. For other architectures (LAGAT, LASAGE, LAGCNII) which we will discuss later, we keep the same setting on the parameter size in the first layer as LAGCN. For GraphSAGE and GCNII, they have similar architectures to GCN and we employ the same modification strategy as LAGCN for LASAGE and LAGCNII. In addition to the concatenation-style design, we can also average X and X as input for GNNs and do not change the architecture.</p><p>LAGAT. Similarly, the first layer of LAGAT is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">H (1) =    K/2 ∥ k=1 σ u∈Nv α k vu W (1) k X u       K ∥ k=K/2+1 σ u∈Nv α k vu W (1) k X u    ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">α k vu is computed on X (1 ≤ k ≤ K/2) or X (K/2 + 1 ≤ k ≤ K). Note that the second dimension of W (1) k</formula><p>is the same as GAT. We just replace the input of the half of the attention heads with X. And we also provide the average-style design for GAT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Loss Functions</head><p>In this section, we explain two loss functions to train LAGNNs and the underlying motivation: supervised loss and consistency loss.</p><p>Supervised Loss. Once we have completed the pretraining of the local augmentation model, we then use the generated feature matrix X produced by it as additional input to enhance the expressive power of GNN models. Given the training labels K and S augmented feature matrix X (s) , we can write the supervised loss function for node classification tasks as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L sup = − 1 S S s=1 i∈K Y i log Z (s) i ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where s) , Θ). Note that we just provide a type of supervised loss function. For other graph learning tasks such as link prediction and graph classification, the supervised loss functions can be adjusted accordingly.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Z (s) = f LAGN N (A, X, X<label>(</label></formula><p>Consistency Regularization Loss.

Intuitively, the consistency regularization encourages invariant prediction of different inputs at each training iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Verma et al., 2019)</ref>. Specifically, the consistency regularization loss function has the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L con = 1 S S s=1 N i=1 Z ′ i − Z (s) i 2 2 , (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Z i = 1 S S s=1 Z (s) i , Z ′ i = Z 1 T i / C c=1 Z 1 T</formula><p>ic is the sharpening trick <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Berthelot et al., 2019)</ref>, and T is a hyperparameter which adjusts the "temperature" of this categorical distribution.

We consider three popular graph neural networks: GCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kipf &amp; Welling, 2017)</ref>, GAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Veličković et al., 2018)</ref>, and GCNII <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2020b)</ref> as our implemented backbones. GCN and GAT are representatives of the state-of-the-art GNN architectures, while GCNII is a deep GNN model with a skip connection design.

But we keep the size of the learnable weight matrix of LAGNN the same as the corresponding GNN model, which is detailed in the Appendix D. We also combine our method with other data augmentation models -GRAND <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Feng et al., 2020)</ref>.

We report the mean node classification accuracy after 100 runs in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>. We reuse the metrics of the baselines already reported in the corresponding papers. The results demonstrate that the backbone models equipped with our method achieve better performance across all three datasets. Specifically, local augmentation can improve upon GCN by a margin of 3.1%, 4.4%, and 2.7% on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed respectively, while the improved margins of LAGAT over GAT are 1.7%, 1.2%, and 2.0% respectively. Moreover, when combined with other data augmentation methods -GRAND, we can still improve by a margin of 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.7% respectively. Furthermore, based on the std information of the experimental results of GRAND and our LA-GRAND, we compute the p-value by t-test to verify the improvements. Except for LA-GCN v.s. GRAND-GCN on Cora (with p-value 0.046), all the p-value ≪ 0.01 by t-test (the same test is also employed by GRAND), which shows the improvements of LAover GRAND-are statistically significant.

We follow the experimental setup as in OGB <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hu et al., 2020)</ref>. For the detailed setup, such as the split ratio and evaluation metric, we just follow the same setting from the OGB implementation.

For a fair comparison, we implement our models on OGB tasks from the open-resource codes with only touching the first layer. From the OGB leaderboard, we can know that the test results are sensitive concerning model size and various tricks. So we do not change the model size of the backbones as suggested in Sec. 3.3 and do not add other tricks. The details of our LAGNN architecture can be found in the Appendix D.

"+ concatenation" means that we only apply our concatenation-style design architecture of LAGCN in Sec. 3.3 with the original feature matrix as additional concatenated input.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Robustness to Missing Information</head><p>In this section, we conduct experiments to verify that our proposed framework is robust against missing information in the feature attributes. Specifically, we mask a certain percentage of the attributes of each feature vector and use the same pipeline to do augmentation for the masked feature matrix. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>, we can see that as the mask ratio increases, the gap of the performance between the GCN and LA-GCN enlarges in most cases in Citeseer, which corroborates our insight that our local augmentation can complement the contextual information of the local neighborhood.</p></div>

Note that we only apply local augmentation without consistency training, and we set S to 1. The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>. From the results, we can draw the following conclusions: 1) The degree of most nodes on the Pubmed test set is relatively small, of which with degree fewer than 6 accounts for about 76.1%. 2) Nodes with smaller degree tend to have lower test accuracy. However, our local augmentation can enrich local information for these nodes and thus enhance their performance.</p></div>

We utilize the MADgap <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., 2020a)</ref> metric to compare our method with existing GNNs. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref> reports the MADgap metric of LAGCN and GCN on Cora (on different layers). We can observe that the MADgap metric of LAGCN is larger than or the same as that of GCN on different layers. Although our approach is not to address over-smoothing, our method can enrich the local neighborhood information and thus can improve the locality of node representations. Therefore, we can alleviate over-smoothing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We propose local augmentation, a new technique that exploits the generative model to learn the conditional distribution of the central node's neighbors' features given the central node's features. We feed the generated feature matrix from a well-trained generative model to some modified backbone GNN models to enhance their performance. Experiments show that our model can improve performance across various GNN architectures and benchmark datasets. Besides, our model achieves new state-of-the-art results on various semi-supervised node classification tasks. One limitation of our proposed framework is that we do not exploit the 2-hop neighbors or use the random walk to find more related neighbors for the central node. One future work is to extract more 2/3-hop neighbors if the central node's degree is small and learn the conditional distribution for random sampling nodes if the graph is large.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">= q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) log p θ (X u , X v , z) q ϕ (z|X u , X v )p θ (X v ) dz = q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) log p θ (X u |X v , z)p θ (X v , z) q ϕ (z|X u , X v )p θ (X v ) dz = q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) log p θ (X u |X v , z)p θ (z|X v ) q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) dz = q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) log p θ (z|X v ) q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) dz + q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) log p θ (X u |X v , z)dz = −KL(q ϕ (z|X u , X v )||p θ (z|X v )) + q ϕ (z|X u , X v ) log p θ (X u |X v , z)dz = −KL(q ϕ (z|X u , X v )∥p θ (z|X v )) + 1 L L l=1 log p θ (X u |X v , z (l) ) B.

Since the generator may generate some features from the long tail of the distribution. This critical question makes the generation inefficient. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nielsen &amp; Okoniewski (2019)</ref>, we introduce active learning to address this issue. During active learning, the probability of each feature is proportional to its uncertainty evaluated by an acquisition function. We adopt the Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) acquisition function <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Houlsby et al., 2011)</ref> with the approximation from the Monte Carlo (MC) dropout samples, which is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">U (X) ≈ H 1 N N n=1 P Y |X, ω n − 1 N N n=1 H P Y |X, ω n , (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>where N is the number of MC samples and ω n are the parameters of the network sampled for the n-th MC dropout sample.</p><p>A high BALD score indicates a network with high uncertainty about the generated feature matrix. So it tends to be selected to improve the GNN model. Finally, the CVAE training procedure is summarized in Algorithm 2.</p></div>

EP-B (García-Durán &amp; Niepert, 2017) and GraphSAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hamilton et al., 2017)</ref> rely on reconstruction loss function between the center node and its neighbors' embeddings. EP-B aims to minimize their defined reconstruction error and make the attribute vector representation reconstructed by the neighbor node from message passing mechanism is as close as possible to the original attribute vector.  GraphSAGE exploits the negative sampling to differentiate the representations of remote node-pairs. GraphSAGE enforce nearby nodes to have similar representations and to enforce disparate nodes to be distinct by minimizing their proposed objective function. The two graph embedding models build upon the assumption that nearby nodes share similar attributes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">X !" X !# X $ X !% (a) The Original Graph X !"
