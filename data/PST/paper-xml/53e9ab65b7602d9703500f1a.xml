<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>AHA!, the "Adaptive Hypermedia Architecture", was originally developed to support an on-line course with some user guidance through conditional (extra) explanations and conditional link hiding. This paper describes the many extensions and tools that have turned AHA! into a versatile adaptive hypermedia platform. It also shows how AHA! can be used to add different adaptive "features" to applications such as on-line courses, museum sites, encyclopedia, etc. The architecture of AHA! is heavily inspired by the AHAM reference model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>After some initial experimental versions AHA! <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> was released as version 1.0 in 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Compared to other adaptive systems like Interbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, KBS-Hyperbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10]</ref> and many others AHA! excelled in the area of simplicity. AHA! has since evolved into a much more powerful system (version 2.0, and soon 3.0), but new versions maintain that basic simplicity. The adaptive hypermedia methods and techniques present in AHA! can be found in Brusilovsky's taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>:</p><p>• A user model based on concepts: Each time you visit a page in an AHA! application the name of the page is passed to the adaptation engine which updates the user model. A user model consists of concepts that have attributes. A typical example of an AHA! action is that visiting a page may increase a knowledge attribute for (the concept corresponding to) that page. This knowledge update may propagate to the knowledge attribute of other concepts, perhaps corresponding to a section or chapter of a textbook. In AHA! a concept can have arbitrarily many attributes of types Boolean, integer or string.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Adaptive link hiding or link annotation: The suitability of link destinations (pages) is determined by an author-defined requirement. This is a (Boolean) expression using arbitrary user model values. The requirements can express the common prerequisite relationships between concepts but can be used for any other condition that can be expressed through such a Boolean expression. When a page is generated, links marked as conditional (using the link class "conditional") are displayed differently depending on the suitability of the link destination. If the expression is true the link is shown in blue (unvisited) or purple (visited), and when the expression is false the link is shown in black, and not underlined. This results in hiding the unsuitable or undesired links. The color scheme can also be altered by the end-user to make all links visible, in different colors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional inclusion of fragments:</head><p>Like for the links to pages the author can also associate a requirement with fragments in a page. This is done through an &lt;if&gt; tag, with one or two fragments, enclosed by a &lt;block&gt; tag. If the expression is true the first fragment is shown to the user, otherwise the second (optional) fragment is shown. This can be used to include prerequisite explanations, or any other piece of content. In the upcoming AHA! version 3.0 fragments can be external objects, represented through the &lt;object&gt; tag. Such objects can themselves also be associated with concepts and accessing them triggers user model updates just like for page accesses.</p><p>AHA! is delivered as Open Source software, written entirely in Java, using Servlets. Several researchers in different countries have used (different versions of) AHA! either for research projects or for courses (or both) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>. In this paper we mainly present the features of AHA! version 2.0, but we do already indicate the new developments that are leading towards version 3.0. Many AHA! features are inspired by the AHAM reference model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, by functionality of other systems and by experience with (and shortcomings of) AHA! in the past.</p><p>In Section 2 we describe the overall architecture of AHA!. This is followed in Section 3 by a description of how the user's interaction with the system results in user model updates, through the adaptation model. Section 4 briefly describes the adaptive presentation and the link adaptation functionality. Section 5 deals with the possibilities to keep parts of a presentation stable. Section 6 introduces the authoring tools. In the final Section 7 we provide an outlook into the future. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">ARCHITECTURE OF AHA!</head><p>The overall architecture of AHA!, shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, shows that AHA! consists of Java servlets that serve pages from the local file system or from external http servers. The servlets interact with a combined domain/adaptation model DM/AM and with a user model UM (in terms of AHAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>). A request for a page (passed to a servlet by the webserver) triggers adaptation rules that perform UM updates. When UM is updated the requested page is parsed to perform the conditional inclusion of fragments. That inclusion is based on the new state of UM. Links on the page (or in included fragments) may be "conditional", meaning that their presentation depends on a "suitability" requirement that is part of the domain/adaptation model. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the types of adaptation performed by AHA!.</p><p>AHA! stores DM/AM and UM (of all users) either as XML files or in a mySQL database. The choice between these two is made by the Manager who configures AHA!, chooses installation directory, path names, etc., and who creates accounts for authors. The configuration is done entirely through a web-based forms interface. AHA! comes with installation instructions for its use with the Open Source Tomcat server.</p><p>Authors typically create the domain/adaptation model through an authoring tool. The Concept Editor offers low-level access to the adaptation model's rules, whereas the Graph Author is used to define concept relationships such as prerequisites. Both tools are described in Section 6. Alternative authoring tools are being developed. Recently, a compiler from Interbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> to AHA! was developed, along with an AHA! addition called the layout model, to create presentations that consist of multiple windows and frames. Another experimental authoring tool uses a scripting language to describe pages and the possible navigation paths <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. It was defined as part of an attempt to combine (parts of) AHA! with Auld Linky, an Open Hypermedia system developed at the University of Southampton.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">DM/AM AND UM IN AHA!</head><p>AHA! applications mainly consist of a set of concepts, some of which are linked to pages or objects (or fragments). Concepts can be used to represent topics of the application domain, e.g. subjects to be studied in a course, or artists, art styles, or art pieces (like paintings) in a museum. In AHA! the author of an application can associate any number of (named) attributes with a concept. Some attributes have a meaning for the system, like access (a Boolean attribute that temporarily becomes true when a page is accessed), some have meaning for the author (and user), like knowledge or interest, and some have meaning for both, like visited (determining the link color). Since AHA! uses an overlay user model, all attributes of concepts in DM/AM also appear in UM.</p><p>The adaptation rules define how the user model is updated. When the user accesses a page (or an object included in a page) the rules associated with the access attribute are triggered. Each rule consists of two parts: a condition and an action. The condition is expressed as a Boolean expression using attributes of concepts, and the action consists of one or more assignments of values or expressions to attributes of concepts. (The expressions can use constants, attribute values, or even the amount by which the triggering attribute was changed.) Optionally there can also be a second action that is performed when the condition is false.</p><p>The actions of a triggered rule update some attributes of some concepts. The author can indicate for every rule whether this action triggers the rules associated with the updated conceptattributes. It is thus easy to define that a page access increases the knowledge of the concept associated with the page, and have that knowledge update cause a knowledge update of a larger topic, like a section of a textbook, and have that knowledge update in turn cause a knowledge update of an even larger topic like a chapter. Similarly, accessing a page that shows a painting in a museum can cause an interest update for the painter, and that may cause an interest update for the style of that painter, etc. The fact that these adaptation rules are completely arbitrary illustrates the power of the AHA! system, but at the same time also shows that it is difficult for an author to predict the outcome of the rule execution.</p><p>It is even possible that the defined rules sometimes cause an infinite loop in the rule execution. (AHA! does limit the rule execution to avoid run-time errors in such a case.) In Section 6 we briefly introduce the Graph Author tool that enables authoring without the need to be familiar with the low level adaptation rules.</p><p>An aspect worth mentioning is the way in which AHA! determines the suitability of a page. With each page (or concept) AHA! associates a requirement expression. This expression is evaluated when needed to determine the suitability of a page. However, rather than evaluating the suitability when needed one can also opt to use a suitability attribute, and just evaluate that Another aspect is the visited status of pages or objects. AHA! uses a visited attribute to store this status. When a page or object is accessed an adaptation rule can set the visited attribute. This is done using a "standard" rule, normally created automatically by the authoring tools. However, since it is just a user model attribute of the concept one can create rules that manipulate this attribute in a different way (e.g. marking previously visited pages as unvisited for some purpose).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">HOW AHA! PERFORMS ADAPTATION</head><p>Adaptation in AHA! is based on a number of attributes associated with concepts, and stored in UM. We describe the adaptation briefly because most of it is already explained above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>When a page (or fragment) contains a link anchor, and the link is marked as (being of class) conditional, the link can be presented using one of three colors, called good, neutral and bad, (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), depending on the requirement expression and visited attribute of the link destination (page).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Content adaptation in AHA! uses the conditional inclusion of fragments technique. There are two ways to use this technique in AHA!: with embedded fragments or with objects. Embedded fragments appear within a page, and are included if an associated suitability expression evaluates to true. A drawback of this technique is that it mixes a DM/AM construct with the actual content pages. Also, the use of an &lt;if&gt; tag for these fragments implies that AHA! pages are not standard XHTML. Therefore it is better to use the newer AHA! 3.0 feature of conditional inclusion of objects. In a page the author includes &lt;object&gt; tags (a part of standard XHTML), with objects of a special type "aha/text". The AHA! engine looks at the ID of the object, which is considered as a concept from DM. The access event of that concept is used to trigger the adaptation engine and perform UM updates. An attribute can be associated with a casegroup tag to select the resource (file) to be inserted in the page at the position of the &lt;object&gt; tag. That fragment is called the returnfragment. It is thus not only possible to conditionally include "a" fragment, but also to choose which fragment to include. Parsing of the page continues with the contents of the fragment (if it is an XHTML file like the page itself). The fragment may also contain an &lt;object&gt; tag, which again triggers the adaptation engine. This process (which might run into an infinite loop if the inclusion is recursive and badly conditioned) continues until all fragments are considered for inclusion and the end of the page is reached. Other XML formats besides XHTML can be used in AHA! as long as they have an &lt;a&gt; tag and an equivalent of the &lt;object&gt; tag. SMIL has been used successfully in an experiment, using the &lt;ref&gt; tag instead of &lt;object&gt;. AHA! can thus be used to augment the limited adaptive functionality already foreseen in SMIL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">STABLE PRESENTATIONS</head><p>In a typical adaptive application each page is adapted to the current UM state each time that page is visited. This may not be the desired behavior according to some users. It may be unsettling that an adaptive website does not always show the same information on the same page.</p><p>For each page or object in AHA! 3.0 one can indicate the desired stability of the presentation. Each page or object can be adapted in four different ways:</p><p>• always adapted: this is the default behavior, in which the page or object is always adapted to the current UM state. • always stable: on the first access the page or object is adapted to the UM state. On subsequent accesses the presentation is identical to the first presentation (except for the link colors based on the visited state, like users have come to expect in web browsers).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>session stable: on the first access during a session the page or object is adapted to the UM state. During the session the presentation remains the same. • expression stable: a stability expression is associated with the page or object. As long as this expression remains true the presentation is kept stable. When the expression becomes false and the page or object is accessed again it is again adapted to the current UM state. In AHA! it is possible to include the same object multiple times on a page (each time possibly resulting in a different fragment). Defining stability for objects only would not allow such pages to be presented in a stable way. Object stability and page stability are therefore both included in AHA!. However, we expect that situations with multiple instances of the same object on a page will be rare.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">AUTHORING TOOLS</head><p>In AHA! version 1.0 all authoring was done directly in XML files for DM/AM and in HTML for the pages. Since AHA! version 2.0 (and thus also with the upcoming 3.0) the DM/AM structure has become a lot more complicated: for each concept there are arbitrarily many attributes. Each attribute can have conditionaction rules to update arbitrary attributes of arbitrary concepts. (In AHA! version 3.0 there are even more features, like the casegroup to choose fragments to include, stability parameters, etc.) Creating AHA! applications without an authoring tool for DM/AM is no longer feasible. Authoring for AHA! is currently facilitated in three ways:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The Concept Editor is a graphical, Java applet based tool to define concepts and adaptation rules. It uses an (authordefined) template to associate a predefined set of attributes and adaptation rules with each newly created concept. It is a low level tool in the sense that all adaptation rules between concepts must be defined by the author. Many applications have a number of constructs that appear frequently, e.g. the knowledge propagation from page to section to chapter, or the existence of prerequisite relationships. This leads to a lot of repetitive work for the author.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The Graph Author is also a graphical, Java applet based tool, but it uses high level concept relationships. Again, when concepts are created a set of attributes and adaptation rules is generated. But this tool also has templates for different types of concept relationships (also defined by the author). Creating knowledge propagation, prerequisite relationships or any other relationship is just a matter of drawing a graph structure using this graphical tool. The translation from highlevel constructs to the low-level adaptation rules is done automatically, based on the templates. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows a screenshot of the Graph Author. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>AHA! has been extended in many ways in the past two years. This paper has described the main features of the latest developments (AHA! versions 2.0, the current version, Spring 2003, and 3.0, upcoming for Fall 2003). The results form a web-based system that:</p><p>• uses standard XHTML for pages and for included fragments, thus enabling the use of off the shelf authoring tools; extensions for XML-based languages such as SMIL are easy; • has a rich user model, representing abstract concepts, pages and fragments, with arbitrarily many attributes per concept, as suggested by the AHAM reference model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>; • offers a simple form of link adaptation, closely resembling the behavior users expect in a browser environment; • offers a powerful content-adaptation method, with (in version 3.0) the ability to conditionally select objects to include, and enabling the use of the same object on different pages without redundant copies.</p><p>Feedback from real users will be the most important source of inspiration for new developments. However, two important ideas have already emerged:</p><p>• There is a need to enable adaptive hypermedia systems to communicate with each other. This means access to each others' DM/AM as well as UM, through a common protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Adaptation has until now been based on the user's browsing behavior. Work is needed to also allow adaptation to aspects of the user, such as cognitive style, and the user's context, such as device and network characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</head><p>The development of the AHA! system was supported by a grant of the NLnet Foundation, through the "Adaptive Hypermedia for All!" project (conveniently abbreviated to AHA!). Further developments, including the communication or translation between different adaptive hypermedia systems (exemplified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>) are supported through the European Minerva project ADAPT, reference number 101144-CP-1-2002-NL-MINERVA-MPP.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Sketch of the architecture of AHA!</figDesc></figure>

Given the fact that AHA! offers a lot of (low-level) functionality this should be possible for many systems. As part of the work on additions to the presentation and layout possibilities of AHA! an Interbook to AHA! compiler was developed [3]. It shows that AHA! can not only emulate the adaptive behavior of Interbook, it can even mimic the presentation quite closely.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,54.00,72.00,244.80,169.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
