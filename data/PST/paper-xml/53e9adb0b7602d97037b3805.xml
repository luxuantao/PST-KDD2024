<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Large-scale scientific experiments based on computer simulations are typically modeled as scientific workflows, which eases the chaining of different programs. These scientific workflows are defined, executed, and monitored by scientific workflow management systems (SWfMS). As these experiments manage large amounts of data, it becomes critical to execute them in high-performance computing environments, such as clusters, grids, and clouds. However, few SWfMS provide parallel support. The ones that do so are usually labor-intensive for workflow developers and have limited primitives to optimize workflow execution. To address these issues, we developed workflow algebra to specify and enable the optimization of parallel execution of scientific workflows. In this paper, we show how the workflow algebra is efficiently implemented in Chiron, an algebraic based parallel scientific workflow engine. Chiron has a unique native distributed provenance mechanism that enables runtime queries in a relational database. We developed two studies to evaluate the performance of our algebraic approach implemented in Chiron; the first study compares Chiron with different approaches, whereas the second one evaluates the scalability of Chiron. By analyzing the results, we conclude that Chiron is efficient in executing scientific workflows, with the benefits of declarative specification and runtime provenance support.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">ALGEBRA FOR SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOWS</head><p>Each existing SWfMS has its own workflow definition language. Desktop engines such as Kepler <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Taverna <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and VisTrails <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> have graphical interfaces that enable workflow modeling, but do not provide primitives directly for HPC. SWfMS for HPC such as Swift <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and Pegasus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> use and provide imperative workflow languages. The way workflow developers program these workflows makes it hard to do optimization as well. Thus, the existing workflow languages directly influence the execution strategy followed by the workflow engine; that is, the workflow engine invokes the programs in the same order as they appear in the workflow definition. However, workflow developers may not be aware of the best program chaining. Also, as the workflow languages are not aware of how activities consume and produce data, the workflow engine is not aware of the behavior of the dataflow prior to the execution.</p><p>To handle this limitation, we proposed algebra for scientific workflows <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This algebra extends database relational algebra <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> by introducing a set of new operators that use both activities and relations as operands. Using relations to represent data consumed and produced by activities allows for representing data uniformly in the workflow. As in relational algebra, relations are defined as sets of tuples of primitive types (integer, float, string, date, etc.) and file references. Thus, in the context of workflows, parameters are now attributes of a relation and the parameter values form the tuples that are consumed and produced. The new operators rule workflow activities by defining the ratio between input tuples consumption and output tuples production. From the algebraic operations, relations, and activities, it is possible to represent algebraic expressions as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. A scientific workflow is then a set of algebraic expressions.</p><p>The proposed scientific workflow algebra considers six different operators as presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. There are four algebraic operators that invoke computer programs. They differ basically in the way tuples are consumed and produced. The Map operator rules activities that, for each input tuple, produce a single output tuple. This is typically the most general case because most computer programs consume a set of input parameter values to produce a set of output parameter values. The SplitMap operator is related to fragmentation and decomposition methods which, based on a single tuple, may produce several output tuples. For the SplitMap, the input tuple needs to have a reference to a file in the input tuple. This file is fragmented during activity execution and each file fragment is referenced in the output tuple. The Reduce operator rules activities that aggregate data. The Reduce  operator then generates a single output tuple from a subset of input tuples. The tuples are grouped based on a set of grouping attributes defined as additional operands, thus producing an aggregated horizontal partition of the input tuples. The Filter operator is used when activities invoke programs that may evaluate if a data is adequate for the workflow. In other words, each input tuple is copied to the output if and only if the activity ruled by the Filter operator analyzes the input tuple and accepts it based on filtering criteria. In this case, the activity works as a sieve of the input tuples. The SRQuery and MRQuery operators are used to execute traditional relational algebra expressions such as selections (s), projections (Π) and joins (⋈) in the workflow relations. The SRQuery operator rules activities that consume the input relation and applies a relational algebra expression to this relation to produce the output relation. Thus, this operator requires only a single input relation and a relational algebra expression as input operands. The MRQuery operator also uses a relational algebra expression as input operand. However, it is related to relational algebra expressions that consume a group of input relations to produce a single relation, such as join operations. Thus, the MRQuery operator requires the relational algebra expression and a set of input relations to be joined. Both SRQuery and MRQuery are used in the workflow to apply data transformation and synchronization.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that these six operators can be combined in algebraic expressions covering many of workflow control patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Thus, to better illustrate how the algebraic operators are used to represent scientific workflows, we use the MapReduce example shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. On the left side, the first algebraic activity uses a Map operator to run program A for each tuple in the input relation R i and stores the results on the output relation R m . The second activity uses the Reduce operator that runs program B to consume the relation R m aggregating the input relation by the "method" attribute; that is, program B consumes all tuples that share the same value for the method attribute (Re and Ga, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) to produce a single output tuple for each different grouping value (Re and Ga), applying a procedure programmed inside B to summarize their results. On the right hand side of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the box diagram represents the workflow and the relations being consumed and produced.</p><p>Many workflow activities in the algebra may invoke third-party legacy computer programs that are not necessarily aware of the algebraic representation used to orchestrate the workflow activities; that is, they may not be ready to execute by consuming and producing tuples. To properly invoke these programs, there is a very important concept in the algebra execution model called activity activation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> inspired by database tuple activations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, or activations, for short. Activations contain the finest unit of data needed by an activity to execute, being composed of three steps: (i) input instrumentation; (ii) program invocation; and (iii) output extraction.  The input instrumentation step extracts data from the input tuple and prepares it to be used by the program, such as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The program invocation step dispatches and monitors the program on a computing resource (e.g., a computing node). Finally, the output extraction step retrieves data from the output generated by the program and builds the output tuple for that activation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CHIRON</head><p>Chiron is a workflow execution engine designed to run workflows in parallel in HPC environments. It was initially designed and developed motivated by the good results obtained with Hydra middleware <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> in solving real scientific and engineering problems by executing applications that involve data fragmentation and parameter explorations in HPC environments. With the performance analysis of these applications, we identified the need to parallelize the entire workflow and exploit opportunities to optimize the workflow execution.</p><p>Chiron uses the message passage interface (MPI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> so that the engine is executed along the computing nodes of the environment. MPI requires the Java Virtual Machine and the MPJ (MPI-like message passing for Java) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> gives a high-level view of the architecture of Chiron, using the perspective of the MPI processes. The figure illustrates k computing nodes (each one with a specific rank) running Chiron in an HPC environment using shared disk storage. It means that all computing nodes have a local view of the experiment data and there is no need for file transfer. Each computing node runs an instance of Chiron, which also gathers provenance data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> (start time, end time, execution status, logs, errors) from the parallel execution of each activation.</p><p>Running the workflow in an HPC environment presents some issues to manage the execution of activities and distributed provenance gathering. To provide reliable management of the workflow activities and their respective activations, Chiron is integrated in the PostgreSQL relational database system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Any instance of Chiron can run activations of the workflow; however, only the main instance (rank 0) can access the database to read and write control and provenance data. Furthermore, Chiron requires some additional libraries such as the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) drivers for PostgreSQL, MPJ libraries and HSQLDB (Hyper Structured Query Language Database) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. These libraries are already embedded in Chiron builds.</p><p>The architecture of Chiron adopts a well-known technique called nested parallelism <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It allows a combination of distribution between cores of nodes using MPI and multi-threading. This approach is adequate because new processors tend to have more cores. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> presents the architecture of Chiron from the threads perspective, assuming k nodes and n cores per node. The rectangles represent each instance of Chiron. Each node has an instance of Chiron, and each instance has a thread to schedule activations to the available activation "processors threads" in the instance. In node 0, there is a thread called "workflow processor", which orchestrates the workflow execution deciding what is ready to be consumed. Then, it distributes these ready activations to the "activation schedulers." The workflow "processor thread" is also responsible to read and write provenance data into the database during the workflow execution.</p><p>The "activation schedulers" use MPI to communicate with the "workflow processor" thread. This communication is used for reporting completed activations and obtaining new activations to be consumed. Whenever a given activation runs in blocking mode, the workflow processor answers a request with a "wait" message instead of answering with an "activation ready" to be consumed. Later, the "activation scheduler" is able to ask for new activations again. When there is no more activation to be consumed, the "workflow processor" answers with a message to finish the execution. In this case, when the "activation scheduler" receives this type of message, it finishes the execution of that instance when all of its "activation processors" finish their activations. All communications between the instances are performed using polling messages, through MPI send and receive primitives.</p><p>Chiron uses the algebraic approach to handle the parallel execution of activations. All workflow data are represented as relations and all activities are ruled by one of the algebraic operators. The algebraic representation of the workflow is written in the XML format that uses a syntax inspired by XPDL (The XML Process Definition Language) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. XML is easier to interpret the algebra by the workflow engine. The XML file (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) contains the metadata (such as the type of algebraic operator for the activity) and descriptions regarding the workflow, its activities, their schema, and the activation command for each activity. Basically, the XML represents all information that is necessary to execute the workflow. The relations of the activities are stored on delimiter-separated value files and are referenced in the XML file (relation and field elements). Using XML to describe the workflow facilitates other high-level workflow modeling tools to be integrated with Chiron. When Chiron starts running, it parses the XML and converts the XML workflow definition to the algebraic expressions. During this process, Chiron stores prospective provenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> information in the database. With the algebraic representation of the workflow available for use, Chiron performs optimization, identifying workflow fragments (group of algebraic expressions), associating dataflow, and dispatching strategies for each fragment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. After evaluating costs and choosing an execution  During the execution, the retrospective provenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is also gathered and stored in the database. The provenance management in Chiron uses a relational database. The mechanism allows for management and monitoring of the activations in runtime. Thus, scientists can execute queries that evaluate provenance data during the workflow execution, and it is possible to know which activities were executed and which ones are still executing. It is also possible to identify errors. All metadata from the workflow, its activities, activations, primitive data, and file references are stored in the Chiron database. The files themselves are kept on the application storage area. Storing this information establishes a prospective and retrospective provenance database for the HPC environment.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> presents the Chiron provenance model using a UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Intuitively, workflows are composed of activities that may have different input and output relations. Each Relation contains a set of Attributes. Activities may produce several Activations. Activities may have template files that are used to build and execute the activations. Also, Activations are associated to a set of tuples and may produce and consume Files during execution. Most attributes of the data model are omitted because of space restrictions; only the most relevant ones are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>. The Activity class, for example, represents data about the operator that rules the activity, the execution status, the command used to perform activation and the command used to extract the results into the output tuple of the activity. It contains other information, such as the time instant the activity starts and finishes. The Activation class represents CHIRON: A PARALLEL ENGINE FOR ALGEBRAIC SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOWS data about its status, and the time when it starts and when it finishes. During the experiment, it is possible to execute queries in the database using SQL to monitor experiment data and the workflow execution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>To evaluate our algebraic approach, we present two experimental studies. The idea of the first study is to compare the performance of our algebraic approach in Chiron with three different approaches that execute scientific workflows in HPC environments: (i) a sequential execution engine coupled to MapReduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (for short, MapReduce); (ii) a sequential execution engine coupled to the Hydra middleware <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (for short, Hydra); (iii) and a parallel execution engine (for short, WfP). In our evaluation, we do not disclose the identity of the SWfMS used because the main idea is to compare the capacity of the algebra implemented in Chiron to process scientific workflows with different approaches, without aiming at a particular SWfMS. In the second study, the scalability of Chiron is evaluated given different complexities and numbers of cores.</p><p>Our evaluation is based on the consumption and production of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> within workflows. We present three characteristic workflows. The pipeline workflow (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>) has an activity that  2334 produces a single output data for each input data consumed; that is, the ratio is 1:1. In the data fragmentation workflow (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>), an activity produces a set of output data for each input data consumed; that is, the ratio is 1:n. Lastly, the data aggregation workflow (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7c</ref>) represents one activity that produces a single output data from a set of input data; that is, the ratio is n:1.</p><p>Additionally, considering the distribution of data that occurs in the data flow among activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, we present two other characteristic workflows: data broadcast (DB) workflow and data join (DJ) workflow. In the DB workflow, the output data of an activity is used as the input for n activities. For example, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7d</ref>, activity C produces output data that is replicated for different types of activity (D and E). In the DJ workflow, each input data comes from n different types of activity. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7e</ref>, output data from activities H and I are joined by activity J, which produces a single output. Both DB and DJ workflows require special control and criteria for data movement. In the DB workflow, the subsequent activities receive a copy of the output data produced by C, and then, they can execute concurrently. The DJ workflow requires synchronism; that is, the activity J can only execute when all of its input data (produced by H and I) are ready to be consumed.</p><p>Besides the consumption and production of data, these workflows provide a control perspective when considering the data transfer from one activity to another. These controls have a correspondence to workflow control patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> gives a summary of the workflows, their ratio of consumption and production of data and their correspondence to workflow control patterns.</p><p>To vary the workflow complexity in our evaluation, we define four classes: C1, C2, C3, and C4. Their complexity is represented by the amount of input data they consume and the duration of the activities in the workflow. The duration is the time spent to process each workflow activity. It follows a gamma distribution Γ(k, θ) (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>), commonly used as a probability model for waiting times <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Class C1 characterizes a workflow that has 512 different input datasets and activities whose duration follows a gamma distribution Γ(4,1). In class C2, the size of the input dataset is 1024, and the duration of the activities is the same as in class C1. In class C3, the size of the input set is the same as in class C1, but the duration of the activities follows a gamma distribution Γ(16,1). Finally, in class C4, the size of the input set is the same as in class C1, but it follows a gamma distribution Γ(64,1) for the duration of the activities. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref> summarizes the four different complexity classes used in the evaluation. The cluster used for the evaluation has 16 nodes with 8 cores per node. It uses a batch system (PBS) Portable Batch System to control job submissions. Because of cluster security policy, this cluster does not allow secure shell connection among the working nodes (just on the head node). Because secure shell connection is required by the MapReduce implementation, it was not possible to use MapReduce for multiple nodes. Additionally, using WfP associated to PBS would degrade its performance severely, which would lead to an unfair comparison among the approaches. Both Hydra and Chiron were designed to work in clusters, and then, they would take advantage of using more nodes. Thus, to be fair with all approaches, the first study was performed using only a single node, that is, eight cores.</p><p>In the first study, as previously mentioned, we compare four approaches to execute scientific workflows in HPC environments: MapReduce, Hydra, Chiron, and WfP. A detailed description of the execution of the workflows and their activities, as well as information regarding the generation of input data for the executions, can be obtained in the SWB (Scientific Workflow Benchmark) portal <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In the MapReduce approach, the workflow was modeled using the user interface of a SWfMS, and the map and the reduce functions were programmed using an API (Application Programming Interface) from a well-known MapReduce implementation (the programmed functions can also be downloaded from the SWB portal). The workflow execution is managed by the SWfMS, coordinating the data movement and the invocation of the map and the reduce functions. In the Hydra approach, the workflows were modeled with SWfMS, and the activities have their execution parallelized using the Hydra middleware, capable of distributing the execution of a workflow activity in a HPC environment. WfP is a well-known SWfMS that has a parallel execution engine and is generally used in clusters and grids. In this approach, the workflows were modeled using a specific programming language, and the activities were encapsulated as applications that are called by the WfP. The set of input data is stored in a file as a matrix, which is required by the WfP syntax. In Chiron, the workflows are represented in a declarative way (based on an XML file) as described in Section 3, which is converted into algebraic expressions that are executed in parallel in the HPC environment.</p><p>In this first study, only the complexity classes C1, C2, and C3 were evaluated. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>-11 show the experimental results (time is expressed in minutes) for each of them, using the characteristic workflows previously defined. The results from class C1 are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, in which MapReduce clearly exhibits the most degraded performance when compared with other approaches. The reason why MapReduce does not perform well is explained by its considerable overhead to manage the map activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Also, the MapReduce implementation is not suitable for short duration activities, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>. Complexity classes for the experimental evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class</head><p>Size of input set Parameters for gamma distribution which is the case for class C1. Both Chiron and WfP have similar results for all workflows. Hydra has a slightly lower performance when compared with Chiron and WfP, and this performance difference is higher when considering the data fragmentation workflow.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C1 512 k = 4, θ = 1 C2 1,024 k = 4, θ = 1 C3 512 k = 16, θ = 1 C4 512 k = 64, θ = 1</formula><p>The results for class C2 are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>. As for class C1, MapReduce has the worst performance (class C2 has also short duration activities). Hydra has a regular performance and both Chiron and WfP obtain the best results. When considering class C3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>), it can be seen that MapReduce improves, but still obtains the worst performance. The reason is that, in class C3, the activities have a longer duration; thus, the overhead to manage the map activities in MapReduce has lower impact.</p><p>To better show these results, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> presents the average speedup <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for each class and approach. Speedup is basically a value that corresponds to the equivalent sequential execution time over the parallel execution time. As we have five different workflows, the speedup for each of them is calculated, and then, an average is computed. From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>, it can be clearly seen that WfP and   Chiron have the best performance, whereas Hydra has an intermediate performance and MapReduce has the worst.</p><p>From the results of the first study, we can conclude that MapReduce has the worst performance considering all the complexity classes, especially because of its overhead in managing map activities. Hydra has also lower performance when compared with both Chiron and WfP, mainly because it parallelizes one activity at a time. WfP performs slightly better than Chiron. This result shows that the overhead of Chiron for workflow execution management and runtime provenance support is negligible. It is worth mentioning that typical parallel SWfMS, such as WfP, lack provenance database to support queries during workflow execution. Generally, provenance data needs to be extracted from WfP log files and inserted into a database system after the workflow executes, such as an ETL (Extract Transform Load) system. Chiron, on the other hand, stores the executions in a relational database and allows for scientists to perform queries, using SQL during the experiments execution. All the queries are considerably fast, lasting less than 1 s in general. There are a variety of queries that can be performed, such as the following:</p><p>• Which activities are executing? • Which activities were already executed?</p><p>• Which output results were already produced?</p><p>• Which activities generated errors, if any, and what were the errors?</p><p>• What was the total execution time of the workflow?</p><p>• What is the total size of the output files?</p><p>• What was the average execution time of the activities?</p><p>• What is the average size of the output files produced by a certain activity?</p><p>• What was the percentage of idle cores for each minute or hour of the execution?</p><p>• What was the average idle time during the execution? Although a comparison considering the development time to design workflows would need a rigorous evaluation using methods from Experimental Software Engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the time used to develop the workflows in WfP and MapReduce was about three times longer than the time used in Chiron. This shows evidence that the declarative aspect used in Chiron brings advantages to construct workflows over the imperativeness that can be found in both WfP and MapReduce.</p><p>For the second study, Chiron is executed for all the complexity classes, using different number of computing cores. In this case, an average speedup is also computed. The idea is to verify how much faster Chiron executes when compared with a sequential execution. The results for this experiment are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>. It can be seen that Chiron is scalable; that is, the performance increases as the number of cores increases. More complex classes scale better because it takes more advantage of parallelism. Class C2 has more input datasets, which can be processed in parallel, and Class C3, even with the same amount of input data as Class C1, has longer activities. Class C4 performs better because it has the longest activities of all the classes.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">RELATED WORK</head><p>There are some approaches in the scientific workflow literature that are also algebraic-based. The most similar approach to the one used in Chiron is QEF (Query Evaluation Framework) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, which is an algebraic approach to represent visualization scientific workflows. In QEF, each activity is an algebraic operation that consumes and produces tuples, and there is an extended query processor that supports algebraic operations for both semantic and control perspectives. Control operations are used to support data transfers, for example, and QEF is capable of expressing workflows that have cycles. QEF, however, does not manage provenance data and follows the traditional iterator based execution model.</p><p>Cantão et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> describe an approach based on process algebra that models workflows using algebraic expressions. However, the optimization occurs primarily in the evaluation of the rules and in the adequate production of data, and not necessarily in the workflow execution. Montagnat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> present an algebraic approach based on matrices. Basically, activities in this approach consume and produce matrices, and it is possible to use vector operations such as dot and Cartesian products. As activities consume only one row of the input matrix each time, there is a lack of expressiveness to represent a different relation of consumption and production.</p><p>There are some approaches that optimize the parallel execution of workflows using the concept of parameter sweep. Parameter sweeps are very common in scientific workflows, and they can be seen as typical scenarios for parallelism, because each case of the sweep can be processed independently. Abramson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> present Nimrod/K, a tool that is capable of facilitating parameter sweeps and scheduling activities in HPC environments. Wings (for Pegasus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> creates concrete activities that correspond to each case of the parameter sweep. In this case, the submitted workflow has already the number of activities according to the number of different values that scientists want to explore. However, it can only parallelize the parameter sweep when the whole workflow is involved in the sweep. Also, it does not present primitives to execute aggregation and fragmentation. Some applications achieve parallelization using a MapReduce approach. For example, existing solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> integrate SWfMS with MapReduce implementations to parallelize the workflow execution, similar to what we did in our first evaluation. In this case, map activities are created and then executed concurrently. An aggregation function, called reduce, is used to combine the results. Both map and reduce functions must be programmed by the workflow developers because they depend on the applications being parallelized. The problem with MapReduce approaches is that, when short duration activities are executed, there is a considerable overhead that worsen the performance, as explained in Section 4. Additionally, some applications do not fit directly into problems that are modeled by MapReduce implementations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Although these approaches represent a step forward and many of them can be seen as complementary to our work, none of them provides for provenance data querying at runtime. Thus, they can be helpful in planning the next workflow execution, but they cannot be used to provide steering mechanisms based on runtime-structured queries. The approach proposed in this paper allows for extracting runtime domain-specific data from data files and representing them related to workflow provenance data <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Most large-scale scientific experiments use computing-intensive applications and large datasets. These experiments are typically designed on the basis of scientific workflows and executed in parallel on HPC environments. However, current approaches to run scientific workflows in parallel lack runtime provenance and have limited primitives to optimize the workflow execution. To address these issues, we presented Chiron, a parallel workflow engine that uses algebra for scientific workflows. This algebra is inspired by relational algebra by using relations as basic data model for input and output of workflow activities. The algebra also uses algebraic operators to handle the workflow activities making it easier for the workflow engine to optimize the parallel execution. In this way, Chiron augments the opportunities to improve the execution strategies. Furthermore, Chiron has native unique provenance management that allows for provenance data browsing and traversing both during the experiment execution and afterwards.</p><p>We evaluated the performance and scalability of Chiron with two experimental studies. In the first study, aimed at comparing Chiron with other approaches, the parallel engines (WfP and Chiron) performed better than the sequential engines attached to a parallelization framework (MapReduce or Hydra), as expected. The performance of Chiron is very close to the other evaluated parallel execution engines with the benefits of being the only to one to support runtime distributed provenance mechanism that let scientists visualize provenance data during workflow execution. In the second study, focused on the scalability of Chiron, the results show that Chiron scales better when dealing with more costly activities, that is, activities that take longer to be computed. However, the size of the consumed data also affects its performance because larger amounts of input tuples made Chiron to scale better when compared with smaller input tuples.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
