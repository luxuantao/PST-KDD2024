<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this article, the author examines voluntary self-disclosure phenomenon among social networking sites. Selfdisclosure enables member interactions, service customizations, targeted marketing, and digital content generation; hence the level of self-disclosure is imperative to the success of social networking sites. Yet, members are often reluctant to reveal themselves despite their desire for socialization in the ever-increasingly popular cyber community. Drawing upon relevant literature, we developed a succinct research model that identifies key stimuli and inhibitors of member self-disclosure. These influences stem from personality traits (e.g., extroversion and privacy value), networking service attributes (e.g., perceived critical mass), and computing environments (e.g., perceived Internet risk). The research model was validated through survey data collected from 222 social networking site users and the analysis results provided support to the hypothesized relationships. The current study generates new knowledge concerning the roles that varying factors play in shaping members' self-disclosure; it also informs networking service providers about how to better encourage members to reveal themselves online.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Until recently, social networking sites have grown rapidly on the Internet. These sites allow members to create personal profiles, manage personal connections, and interact with other members with similar interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Due to the support in the management of personal networks, these websites have attracted millions of online users. As of February 2012, Pew Internet found that 66% of online adults use social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Facebook alone, for example, attracted 995 million monthly active users in June 2012, with about 80% of users residing outside of the United States and Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Social networking sites are considered by many as the "greatest invention of the past decade" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and the "best invention of the 21st century" <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. These websites have made significant impacts on general society because they create brand new frontiers for interpersonal communications and interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref>. Academia recognizes this impact; several research streams exist within the realm of social networking studies, including self-presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>, network topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, and adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. However, less is known about member self-disclosure.</p><p>Self-disclosure refers to any personal information one shares with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This may include "any information exchange that refers to the self, including personal states, dispositions, events in the past, and plans for the future" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. New knowledge in this regard is imperative to the long-term sustainability of social networking sites for four reasons: First, member information that is released through self-disclosure lays the foundation for social interactions among site members. Without self-disclosure, members of a networking site may not be able to learn about each other; hence, the growth and expansion of personal networks will halt <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Second, self-disclosure enables social networking providers to collect and analyze member information and provide personalized services for improved user satisfaction. Third, social networking sites rely on advertising as their primary revenue source and advertisers need member information in order to offer customized ads for targeted marketing. Fourth, site members who engage in self-disclosure are likely to create user-generated-contents such as photos, videos, and blogs; these contents contribute to the wealth of an online community and subsequently attract new members, therefore allowing networking service providers to propagate their business models for greater success.</p><p>Recent studies have confirmed that networking site members have become increasingly reluctant to reveal themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Many users shy away from public attention and would rather keep their lives private when engaging in the "best known" public sphere in recent history. These members reveal little on their public profiles and resort to private channels or access-controlled interaction modes for information sharing with trusted friends only. Surprisingly, their pursuit of privacy does not necessarily result in an abandonment of social networks; members may still feel a strong sense of belonging and remain loyal to the networking sites. <ref type="bibr">McKnight et al. put</ref>: "the level of information disclosure does not necessarily prohibit social network use" <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Due to this behavioral tendency, online business services and models that rely on member disclosure are in jeopardy. To date, prior literature has generated little empirical findings to uncover members' self-disclosure behavior and it remains largely unknown as to why one will expose or withhold his or her identity, likes, and dislikes on a public network <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>. Our study attempts to fill this research gap.</p><p>This study answers the research question of "What are the key determinants of members' self-disclosure among social networking sites?" Drawing upon the theoretical model of Information Disclosure Behavior (IDB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> and the literature on social networking sites, we developed and validated a succinct research model that provided preliminary answers to our question. This research model separates an individual's perception of a social networking site from his or her behavioral preference of privacy disclosure; it makes a two-fold contribution. First, it validates the importance of member attitude in cultivating voluntary self-disclosure behavior on networking sites. In this study, attitude refers to an individual's positive evaluative effect about using a given social networking site. Existing literature about social networking has largely ignored the role of attitude; by surveying 222 users of social networks such as Facebook, MySpace, and Friendster, we found evidence that member attitude strongly promotes the extent of member self-disclosure. Our study also confirms that personality traits such as extroversion, service attributes such as perceived critical mass, and external environments such as perceived Internet risk jointly cultivate members' overall attitude. These aforementioned factors have been understudied within the context of social networking. Second, the current study probes the role that privacy values play in deterring site members from revealing themselves. Analyses of the survey data find that privacy value attenuates the relationship between attitude and self-disclosure. Privacy value has not been well studied within the context of social networking sites and our findings suggest that it accounts for the apparent paradox where Internet users strongly attach themselves to a networking site yet remain highly conservative in terms of self-disclosure.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the subsequent section reviews the literature on social networking sites as well as the theoretical underpinning of the current study. Secondly, we present our research model along with the foundational research hypotheses. This section is followed by an elaboration upon research methodology and data analysis. We conclude the paper by discussing its theoretical contributions, managerial implications, limitations, and venues for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Prior studies on social networking</head><p>To date, a number of research streams exist in the domain of social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Some scholars have studied site user selfpresentation and impression management. Using survey methodology, Ong et al. explored the impact of narcissism and extraversion on adolescents' self-presentation behavior on Facebook. Among the results, they found that narcissism was associated with users' presentation of selfgenerated content such as the frequency of status updates <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Pearson took a narrative approach to examine the role of visuals on impression management on SNSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Interview data confirmed images' importance in identity performance. Others have explored the typology of social networks and their development. Ahn et al. studied the topological characteristics of large online social networking services <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. They also assessed the extent to which online relationship growth resembles real life social networks. Through comparisons drawn between Cyworld, MySpace, and Orkut, they found that certain online social activities were distinctive from real life activities and that online social networks shared a similar degree of correlation patterns with real life networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Fu et al. investigated the self-organizing structural characteristics of social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. By analyzing real data from a large networking site, they studied the distribution of topological distance and correlations between degrees, clustering coefficients, and popularity. The results showed that social networking sites demonstrate an assortative mixing pattern. Further research has explored user adoption of social networking sites. Sledgianoski and Kulviwat found that actual site adoption was affected by use intention which was influenced by factors such as perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Rosen and Kluemper inspected the impact of the big five personality traits on users' acceptance of networking websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. They found that conscientiousness affected perceived ease of use; extroversion affected perceived usefulness and ease of use; and agreeableness, openness and neuroticism didn't have any significant impact on users' acceptance of the sites.</p><p>In terms of self-disclosure, existing literature has examined its subsequent impacts. <ref type="bibr">Ledbetter et al.</ref> found that the interaction between self-disclosure and social connection directly predicted member communications on Facebook and indirectly predicted relational closeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Mazer et al. found that students who accessed a teacher's Facebook page that was high in self-disclosure anticipated higher levels of motivation and affective learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Prior studies have also examined the motivations behind self-disclosure; yet, the majority of studies have been limited to descriptive or conceptual discussion and modeling. Tow et al. surveyed Australian Facebook users to find that users were often simply unaware of privacy issues or felt that the risk to them, personally, was very low when sharing private information <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Li et al. combined the theory of planned behavior and privacy calculus theory to suggest that perceived benefits and privacy concerns might jointly determine privacy disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Xu et al. studied the case of Facebook news feed controversy to posit that privacy disclosure behavior might be affected by privacy concerns and that this effect could be moderated by perceived benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. Few empirical studies have been conducted to uncover the stimuli and inhibitors of members' self-disclosure behavior, thus generating limited findings that suggest boundaries (e.g. ingroup/outgroup) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, perceived enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and social capitals (e.g., reciprocity and trust) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> might shape self-disclosure. No study has explicitly attended to the paradox where Internet users strongly attach to a networking site yet remain conservative in revealing themselves. Therefore, more research is warranted in order to foster a comprehensive understanding of member self-disclosure phenomenon. New knowledge gained through this research will help networking service providers develop proper strategies to prompt member disclosure, thus making a noticeable contribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Theoretical background</head><p>Posey et al. stated "Self-disclosure research in online communities is just starting to emerge" <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. To date, there is a dearth of prior findings and established theoretical underpinnings that help us examine this phenomenon. In this paper, we follow the theoretical model of users' Information Disclosure Behavior (IDB) to examine members' voluntary self-disclosure phenomenon among social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Developed by Tow et al. through an ethnographic study of networking site users, IDB is instrumental in identifying the pertinent research constructs that jointly explain self-disclosure behavior; it identifies value and context as the two focal theoretical constructs. In accordance with IDB, value constructs concern a member's attitude toward site use and personal preferences and comforts such as privacy; whereas contextual constructs regard factors pertaining to one's objective of site use as well as own previous online experience that is relevant. Furthermore, IDB suggests that self-disclosure is determined by value constructs that, in turn, are affected by contextual constructs.</p><p>For value constructs, the recognition of attitude and privacy is congruent with the existing literature that analyzes end-user behavior within privacy involved information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In this study, attitude refers to an individual's positive evaluative effect about using a given social networking site. Attitude has been widely employed in the field of information systems to explain user behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90]</ref>. Theoretical frameworks such as Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) link an individual's attitudes toward objects to his or hers own actions, whereas attitude reflects the extent to which one likes an object and an object refers to any given aspect of the individual's world <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. EVT states that attitudes are developed based on subjective assessments about beliefs and values; that attitude leads to behavioral outcomes. Within the context of social networking sites, attitude has also been identified as a key antecedent to users' behavioral choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. Meanwhile, social networking sites pose unique threats upon member privacy. Due to the very nature of social interactions, users are likely to surrender personal data such as identity, private interests, and personal opinions in order to network with others. This behavior introduces immense privacy concerns that are far beyond the average trepidations one may experience during regular Internet engagements. Individuals who reveal themselves may not be able to control who sees their information and how others choose to respond toward it <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. Exploited privacy may be used against one's will for malicious purposes such as stalking, embarrassment, and extortion.</p><p>As to the contextual constructs, the existing literature on social networking sites has highlighted several important factors. Perceived critical mass refers to one's judgment concerning whether a collective information system has reached its critical mass in order to achieve self-sustaining growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>; perceived critical mass is directly associated with the future gains that members may expect from using a social networking service <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>. An extroverted personality is defined as possessing positive emotion, surgency, and a tendency to seek out the stimulation and company of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>; it closely relates to the level of fun that one obtains through his or her engagement on a networking site <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>. Perceived Internet risk measures one's uneasiness about using the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>; it reflects prior experience with regards to the immediate surrounding computing environments of social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. Prior studies have pointed out that value constructs such as attitude toward an information system may be influenced by sources emanating from personal traits, networking service attributes, and external environments within which an individual behaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. We therefore consider variables such as perceived critical mass, extroversion, and perceived Internet risk in our research model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research model and hypotheses</head><p>Drawing upon IDB and literature that assesses social networking sites, we developed a research model that predicts member voluntary information disclosure. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> suggests that an individuals' attitude toward a social networking site determines their extent of self-disclosure. Moreover, the research model posits that attitude is cultivated by personal traits such as extroversion, networking service attributes such as perceived critical mass, and external environments such as perceived Internet risk. Finally, the research model postulates that personal concerns such as privacy values may attenuate the relationship between attitude and self-disclosure behavior. This research model separates members' perceptions of a social networking site from their subsequent behavioral choices in terms of privacy disclosure.</p><p>In this study, attitude refers to an individual's positive evaluative effect toward using a given social networking site. Through the use of a social networking service, members develop individual attitudes toward that service, eventually resulting in a positive or negative judgment over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In accordance with EVT, we postulate that one's attitude predicts his or her behavioral outcome when using a social networking site.</p><p>Among the others, self-disclosure is a site use activity of high popularity. A report by National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) found that 74% of social networking site members reveal much of their personal information <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. An average Facebook user, for example, creates 90 pieces of content each month through which one reveals his or her own identities, thoughts, and experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The disclosed information remains highly accurate: for example, Gross et al. found that about 90% of the names on Facebook were truthful, leading some to describe Facebook as the "Google of people" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Accordingly, we expect members' attitudes will impact their self-disclosure behavior.</p><p>H1. Attitude is positively related to self-disclosure.</p><p>Literature suggests that members' use experiences may be dependent upon personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Extroversion is defined as a positive emotion, surgency, and a tendency to seek out stimulation and the company of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This personality trait is discerned by manifest engagement with the outside world; extroverted persons enjoy being with people. Social networking sites offer rich communication features such as texting, video sharing, emailing, and blogging. These designs render network sites as ideal platforms for individuals to express themselves, enjoy social events, affirm relationships, and extend personal networks. When presented with these opportunities, an extroverted member will take advantage of them to better meet his or her social needs. Rosen and Kluemper suggest that social networking sites are not only useful but instrumental for extroverts in publicly asserting themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. It is therefore argued that members who are extroverted are more likely to appreciate a social networking site and become fond of it. And thus we posit: H2. Extroversion is positively related to attitude.</p><p>Hsu and Lu suggest that user attitude toward online systems may be affected by a perception of critical mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Perceived critical mass is based on the notion of critical mass, which refers to the point where sufficient users have used a technology to an extent that its continuous usage and growth is self-sustaining <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>. Since it is often difficult for users to measure the actual critical mass threshold, an individual usually relies on his or her personal perception of whether the system has reached the threshold; this perception is appropriately termed as perceived critical mass. Perceived critical mass distinguishes itself from network externalities because it considers a network's internal threshold and sustainable growth. When applied, perceived critical mass suggests that the sheer quantity of users on a networking site may not predict the site's ultimate utility. Rather, a given networking site must reach the threshold in order to secure long term vitality and prosperity. From an individual user's point of view, perceived critical mass therefore acts as a more reliable indicator rather than network externalities to signal the definitive future gains that members may expect from using a networking site. When members perceive that a networking site has reached critical mass, they will expect a great amount of sustainable future gains with confidence, as the community offers an increasing amount of interactive activities such as grooming, poking, and gossiping <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. As a consequence, a member may form a positive attitude. We expect: H3. Perceived critical mass is positively related to attitude. An individual's experience and judgment of networking sites may be affected by the external environment in which such interaction takes place <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Perceived Internet risk measures one's uneasiness about using the Internet. The Internet is known for the parlance of cyber threats which significantly jeopardize online users and businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. A high level of perceived Internet risk may lead Internet users to exaggerate uncertainties on networking sites, exhibit unwarranted confidence in their judgment, and subsequently overestimate the risks of using social networking sites. On the contrary, individuals who perceive Internet risk as low may tend to underestimate any actual dangers. Social networking members may have varying levels of Internet risk perception as a result of their prior Internet use (e.g., online shopping) and outcome history. It is common for users to become averse toward a networking site because the sense of Internet risk is perceived as overwhelming. Therefore we expect:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attitude</head><p>H4. Perceived Internet risk is negatively related to attitude. Social networking literature suggests that members' values related to their personal sense of privacy tend to influence their online behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. Research on privacy has found that individuals differ in their privacy values <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. Privacy value refers to the importance an individual places on personal privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and may be cultivated by individual disposition, culture, and past experiences with privacy invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. Within the context of social networking sites, privacy value may affect site members in terms of their susceptibility to affection (attitude) toward the networking site. When privacy value is low, members' selfdisclosure may be largely dependent on their positive attitude of the site. When privacy value is high, however, individuals' rational decision making processes are likely to be compromised and their decisions on self-disclosure may be biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. Considering the high stakes that are involved, users may become hesitant to reveal themselves regardless of their personal assessments of the networking site, whether they are positive or negative. That is, the predicting power of attitude on self-disclosure may weaken at the presence of high privacy values. Therefore we expect: H5. Privacy value attenuates the relationship between attitude and self-disclosure.</p><p>In addition, we account for the potential impacts of age and gender. Nosko et al. found that the amount of personal information in profiles decreased as age increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Papini found that females exhibited more self-disclosure than males <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. Zhang found that age and gender both affected an individual's attitude toward web information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Measurement development</head><p>Measurement items for the principal constructs in this study were borrowed directly from existing measures to ensure validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. The detailed measurements and their sources for defining the principal constructs are shown in Appendix A. The survey instruments were pretested with 60 users of a social networking site to check the psychometric properties of the measurement scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Following this pretest, the measurement instruments were shortened, refined, and validated for their statistical properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Survey administration</head><p>Our research model was tested using survey data. We collected survey responses from two hundred and twenty-two (222) students who took undergraduate courses at a large institution in the Midwestern United States. College students are a significant segment of social networking site users. A recent Pew survey showed that college students represented the largest portion of Facebook users <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>; as a result, a student sample was appropriate for our research. The respondents were recruited from four (4) undergraduate courses that were offered at a business college. The samples consisted of business and non-business major undergraduates; as a result, the samples are heterogeneous. Respondents were guaranteed both confidentiality and access to the aggregated survey results. Participation in the survey was voluntary. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides respondent demographic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Analysis and results</head><p>We tested the research model using structural equation modeling analysis. We used partial least squares (PLS) which employs a component-based approach for estimation and places minimal restrictions on sample size and residual distributions. PLS is best suited for testing complex relationships by avoiding inadmissible solutions and factor indeterminacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. PLS also supports exploratory research. Our article explores an important yet understudied research topic; PLS is therefore appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Measurement model</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> reports the correlation matrix, the AVEs, and the descriptive statistics of the principal constructs. Measurement reliability was assessed using composite reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> and Cronbach's alpha <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Fornell and Larcker suggested that a composite reliability of .70 or greater is considered acceptable for research <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Nunnally suggested that a Cronbach's alpha of .70 or greater is considered acceptable for research <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. As visible in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the internal consistencies of all variables are considered acceptable since they exceed .70, thus signifying satisfactory reliability.</p><p>Convergent and discriminant validity are inferred when (1) the square root of each construct is larger than its correlations with the other constructs (i.e., the AVE shared between the construct and its indicators is larger than the AVE shared between the construct and the other items);</p><p>(2) all AVEs are greater than .50; and (3) the PLS indicators load much higher on their hypothesized construct than on other constructs (i.e., own loadings are higher than cross loadings) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the square roots of the AVE were all greater than 0.5 and greater than all other cross correlations, indicating that the variance explained by each construct was much larger than the measurement error variance. As in Appendix B, all items loaded high on their own constructs. These tests validate the measurement properties of principal constructs.</p><p>The research data was collected from a single survey; therefore we checked for the extent of common method bias. First, the Harman's one-factor test was performed by including all the variables in a principal components factor analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Common method bias exists when one single factor emerges or when one factor accounts for the majority of the covariance among the variables. The results showed that none of the six emergent factors explained the majority of the covariance: the largest factor explained 21% of the covariance. Second, the correlation matrix was examined for highly correlated factors. Common method bias exists when extremely high correlations (r&gt; .9) exist. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> does not reveal such evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Structural model</head><p>The PLS path coefficients are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. All of these paths are statistically significant. The structural model explained 20% of the variance in self-disclosure and 13% of variance in attitude toward a social networking site. The theoretical model thus offers satisfactory explanatory power in capturing members' voluntary self-disclosure among social networking sites. In terms of the control variables, age (b = -.12, p b .05) was found to influence attitude whereas gender (b = -.12, p b .05) was found to impact self-disclosure behavior. The PLS results indicated that members' attitude (b=.42, pb .001) significantly determines their extent of self-disclosure, confirming H1. Further, extroversion (b=.18, pb .01), perceived critical mass (b=.17, pb .05), and perceived Internet risk (b=-.12, pb .05) were found to jointly affect attitude toward a social networking site. H2, H3, and H4 are therefore supported.</p><p>We followed the PLS product-indicator approach by Chin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to test the moderated relationship (H5). The newly created interaction construct was found to attenuate the relationship between enjoyment and site use (b=-.13, pb .05). We then followed Carte and Russell <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to test whether the variance explained due to the moderated effects was significant beyond the main effects, using the following F-statistic. The F test statistic was 4.07 (pb .05). The tests of moderating effect thus provided support for the postulated moderating effect of privacy value on the relationship between attitude and self-disclosure (H5).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F df interaction -df main ; N-df interaction -1 ð Þ ¼ ΔR 2 =df interaction -df main 1-R 2 interaction À Á = N-df interaction -1 ð Þ :</formula><p>Overall, the results provide evidence to support the research model that is proposed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Before discussing the contributions and implications of this study, our research's limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, we tested the research model using survey data that was collected from 222 samples. While this sample size is comparable to prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>, it is a small sample and may limit the power of the statistical analyses. Future research that employs a greater sample size is needed to revalidate the research model. Secondly, the current study recruits college students as its research sample. While college students compose the largest user group of leading networking sites such as Facebook, other users such as teenagers and working adults over age 22 are all actively engaged on Facebook. Thus, the results must be treated with caution in terms of its generalizability to other user populations on social networking sites. It is imperative that new studies validate the research model among these alternative populations. Thirdly, the current study employs a cross-sectional design which does not allow us to observe the longitudinal impact. Hence, the results should be treated with caution because causality cannot be inferred with cross-sectional data. While a longitudinal analysis is preferred, solid cross-sectional models must be established before future research can examine their viability over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Fourthly, the current study utilizes self-reported survey data to assess online behavior on networking sites. In his study of social networks, Whinston noted that self-reported data "reveal[s] information that the user is willing to provide which might be biased or even inconsistent with her actual opinion or behavior" <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. Future research may employ objective measurements to assess the actual disclosure of the research samples. Additionally, the use of a survey as the main research method for data collection is subject to certain limitations. While survey reduces interviewer bias and reaches a large population, precision and control are accordingly lost in a survey when it focuses solely on realism <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. While each methodological approach is somewhat flawed and while there's no perfect research method, future studies may consider adopting multiple methodologies (e.g., experiments) to retest the model. Fifthly, the current study has explored a limited set of antecedents to user attitude. These antecedents are suggested by the pertinent literature and they have received strong support from the empirical test. Future studies may enrich the research model by incorporating more antecedents that are informed by relevant literature's findings in an attempt to improve the R 2 of attitude and self-disclosure.</p><p>The current study makes a two-fold contribution. For one, our study empirically validates the role of attitude in explaining member disclosure; it also identifies the major predictors of attitude. Prior studies on social networks have largely ignored the value of attitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. Findings that are reported in this study have evidenced the importance of attitude in shaping members' extent of disclosure. The research confirms that personality, service attributes, and external environments all contribute to the positive evaluative effect of a given social networking site. These antecedents (e.g., extroversion) have been understudied by prior literature and our research attests to their values. Secondly, our study contributes to existing privacy literature by confirming the significance of personal privacy values. We find that privacy values negatively interact with attitude in determining member disclosure. These findings are consistent with anecdotal evidence that members may maintain a strong relationship with a given social network site yet strive to minimize self-disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. Privacy values have received little attention from existing literature  concerning social networking sites. Our study fills this gap by highlighting its crucial role in explaining member self-disclosure.</p><p>The current study also informs practice. Self-disclosure adds vital support to the sustainable growth of networking sites; service providers may stimulate the extent of member exposure by cultivating users' attitudes. To improve users' attitude, networking service providers may encourage member extroversion. Psychology literature has pointed out that personality is malleable and it may be reformed given proper motivations from the task environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. To this end, site wide campaigns that promote an open, social, interactive, and responsive culture are likely to inspire members to become more extroverted and therefore better appreciate the value of using networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Service vendors may also alter member attitude by increasing their perceived critical mass. A number of approaches are available to boost the perception of critical mass, including site designs (e.g., Friendster's enhanced feature that allows users to view others' profiles), intensive promotions, potential user discovery, and user education <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. Meanwhile, vendors may improve member attitude through a reduction of their Internet risk perception. To this end, public awareness and educational campaigns may be exercised. Educational campaigns are suggested to improve user knowledge and provide skills for combating cyber threats and consequently reduce the odds of being attacked <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref>. Awareness programs help remove the cognitive bias pertaining to Internet risks and cultivate a healthy and accurate risk assessment. Meanwhile, the use of security assurance signs may also reduce members' perception of Internet risk. Security assurance signs such as Trust Guard, Verisign, and Comodo adhere to security standards established by certifying agencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. These signs attest to an online business's ability to protect consumers against cyber-attacks and may alleviate the perceived Internet risk when adopted by social networking sites. In addition, our findings suggest that members' privacy values have an adverse effect on self-disclosure through their interactions with attitude. While a user's privacy value may be altered through proper motivations, literature has suggested that trust-instilling approaches may help offset the negative impact of privacy value on member behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Reputation systems that validate user credibility and monitor individual ethical conducts may be implemented to encourage trustful behavior within the online community <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103]</ref>. Other designs such as privacy protection policies and privacy-aware system architecture and software features may also assure members of their privacy preservation, hence alleviating the impact of privacy value on disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Social networking sites are continually increasing in popularity. The latest Pew survey showed that, worldwide, 47% of online adults use social networking sites and 73% of teens and young adults are members of at least one social network <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. A 2010 Nielsen report found that the world now spends over 110 billion minutes on social networks and that the number of people visiting these sites has increased by 24% over the last year <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. To sustain the success of a social networking site, it is important that members reveal themselves to initiate social interactions and propel the expansion of personal networks. In addition, self-disclosure enables personalized services, offers target marketing, and encourages digital content generation. Despite strategic importance from a business standpoint, site members still choose to control the extent of their personal self-disclosure. Recent studies have confirmed that online users become increasingly reluctant to reveal themselves when they initiate relationships through networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Drawing upon IDB and the literature on social networking sites, the current study explores the sources of influence on self-disclosure. By surveying real users of networking sites, we found that user attitude is the key instigator that drives members in self-disclosed engagements. We also found that personality traits (extroversion), networking service attributes (perceived critical mass), and external environments (perceived Internet risk) jointly shaped user attitudes. Finally, our statistical results confirmed that individual privacy values attenuated the relationship between attitude and disclosure behavior. As the existing literature is primarily focused on conceptual modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>, findings that are reported in the current study contribute to the growing body of literature on social networking sites with more nuanced insights pertaining to user privacy disclosure.</p><p>This research is motivated by the need to understand the discrepancy between users' positive attitudes toward networking sites and their subsequent behavior in terms of self-disclosure. Prior studies suggest that users may be fond of a social networking site, yet feel reluctant to reveal themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. In their survey with Facebook members, Tow et al. found that 31% of the respondents indicated that they did not put much personal information on their profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. To this end, our findings suggest that privacy disclosure behavior is encouraged by members' positive attitude toward the site while discouraged by individual privacy values. Further research and advancement of our study may reveal that there are more factors that account for user self-disclosure behavior; still, we believe that this study makes a small but noticeable step toward a better understanding of why online users choose to disclose themselves in an emerging online platform such as social networking sites. 1.
