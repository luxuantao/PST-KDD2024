<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A wireless ad hoc network consists of a distribution of radios in a certain geographical area. Unlike cellular wireless networks, there is no centralized control in the network, and wireless devices (called nodes hereafter) can communicate via multi-hop wireless channels: a node can reach all nodes inside its transmission range while two far-away nodes communicate through the relaying by intermediate nodes. An important requirement of these networks is that they should be self-organizing, i.e., transmission ranges and data paths are dynamically restructured with changing topology. Energy conservation and network performance are probably the most critical issues in wireless ad hoc (and sensor) networks, because wireless devices are usually powered by batteries only and have limited computing capability and memory.</p><p>A wireless ad hoc or sensor network is modelled by a set V of n wireless nodes distributed in a two-dimensional plane. Each node has the same maximum transmission range R meters, e.g., a typical 802.11g wireless LAN adapter has a transmission range around 100m -500m. By a proper scaling, we assume that all nodes have the maximum transmission range equal to one unit. These wireless nodes define a unit disk graph U DG(V ) in which there is an edge between two nodes iff the Euclidean distance between them is at most one unit. In other words, we assume that two nodes can always receive the signal from each other directly if the Euclidean distance between them is no more than one unit. Notice that, in practice, the transmission region of a node is not necessarily a perfect disk. As done by most results in the literature, for simplicity, we model it by disk in order to first explore the underlying nature of ad hoc networks. Hereafter, U DG(V ) is always assumed to be connected. We also assume that all wireless nodes have distinctive identities(IDs). Additionally we assume that each node knows the relative position of its one-hop neighbors. The relative position of neighbors can be estimated by the direction of signal arrival and the strength of signal. The geometry location of a wireless node can also be obtained by a localization method, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>. We here assume that the localization is low cost or it is already required by some other protocols. Notice that the higher these localization costs, the less desirable the advocated approach to design any protocol based on nodes' geometry location.</p><p>We adopt the most common power-attenuation model from literature: the power needed to support a link uv is assumed to be uv β , where uv is the Euclidean distance between u and v, β is a real constant between 2 and 5 depending on the wireless transmission environment. Throughout this paper we only focus on the transmission power of all nodes. This energy model only accounts for the emission power. This can be a good approximation of what happens in case of long range techniques although the actual energy consumption is given by a fixed part (receiving power and the power needed to keep the electric circuits on) plus the emission power component. In other words, we assume that the transmission range is large enough such that the emission power is the major component and the receiving power is negligible. Notice that, as pointed out by an anonymous reviewer, even if the energy cost of receiving a packet is high, there are a number of ways of reducing this cost by reducing the number of packets received by but not intended for a node. It includes, but is not limited to, the following approaches: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> "signals are sent with special small preambles that identify the intended recipient"; (2) "the radios are frequency-agile and can choose different frequency channels to communicate with different neighbors" (3) "the radios have directional antennas which limit the volume over which their signals are received "; (4) "favoring routes that traverse sparser portions of the network ".</p><p>The (localized) topology control technique lets each wireless device (locally) adjust its transmission range and select certain neighbors for communication, while maintaining a decent global structure to support energy efficient routing and to improve the overall network performance. A distributed method is localized if it runs in constant number of rounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. By enabling each wireless node to shrink its transmission power (which is usually much smaller than its maximum transmission power) sufficiently enough to cover its farthest selected neighbor, topology control schemes can not only save energy and prolong network life, but also improve the network throughput through mitigating the MAClevel medium contention. Unlike traditional wired and cellular networks, the movement of wireless devices during the communication could change the network topology to some extent. Hence, it is more challenging to design a topology control algorithm for ad hoc wireless networks: the topology should be locally and self-adaptively maintained using low communication cost, without affecting the whole network's performance.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are as follows. We present the first communication efficient algorithm to construct a unified energy-efficient topology for unicast and broadcast in wireless ad hoc/sensor networks. In one single structure, we guarantee the following network properties:</p><p>1. power efficient unicast: given any two nodes, there is a path connecting them in the structure with total power cost no more than 2ρ+1 times of the power cost of any path connecting them in the original network.</p><p>Here ρ &gt; 1 is some constant that will be specified later. 2. power efficient broadcast: the power consumption for broadcast is within a constant factor of optimum among all locally constructed structures. Notice that our structure cannot guarantee that the energy consumption is within a constant factor of the global optimum. Essentially, we prove that the structure is lowweighted : its total edge length is within a constant factor of that of Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree. 3. bounded logical node degree: each node has to communicate with at most k -1 logical neighbors, where k ≥ 9 is an adjustable parameter; 4. bounded average physical node degree: the average physical node degree is bounded from above by a small constant. Here the physical degree of a node u in a structure H is defined as the number of nodes inside the disk centered at u with radius maxuv∈H uv . 5. planar: there are no edges crossing each other. This enables several localized routing algorithms, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>, to be performed on top of this structure to guarantee the packet delivery without routing table. 6. neighbors Θ-separated: the directions between any two logical neighbors of any node are separated by at least an angle θ, which as we will see reduces the signal interference. It also can be used to reduce the receiving power cost when directional antenna is used. In graph theoretical terminologies, given a unit disk graph modelling the wireless ad hoc networks, we propose an communication efficient distributed method to build a low-weighted planar power-spanner with a bounded logical node degree. Here a geometric structure is called low-weighted if its total edge length is no more than a small constant factor of that of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first known communication efficient algorithm to construct such a single structure with all these desired properties. Previously, only a centralized algorithm was reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Moreover, by assuming that the ID and position of every node can be represented in O(log n) bits for a wireless network of n nodes, we show that the structure can be initially constructed using at most 5n to 13n messages.</p><p>In addition, we prove that the expected average node interference (which is defined as the number of nodes within its adjusted transmission range) in the structure is bounded by a small constant. This is significant in its own due to the following reasons: it has been taken for granted that "a network topology with a small logical node degree will guarantee a small interference" and recently Burkhart et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> showed that this is not true generally. Our results show that, although generally a small logical node degree cannot guarantee a small interference, the expected average interference is indeed small if the logical communication neighbors are chosen carefully. All our theoretical results are corroborated in simulations.</p><p>We also show that our structure can be easily updated in a dynamic environment when a node moves or dies after the battery power is drained. When a node moves, the topology can be dynamically self-maintained without affecting the whole network, since each node adjusts its transmission range and selects neighbors only according to its neighbor information.</p><p>To facilitate the efficient construction of such a unified energy-efficient topology, in the paper, we will first give an improved method to construct degree-bounded planar spanner by using relative positions only. The new structure has the same power spanning ratio ρ =</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">√ 2 β 1-(2 √ 2 sin π k ) β</formula><p>as the structure proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. Here k ≥ 9 is a customizable parameter. In addition, the directions between any two neighbors of each node are separated by at least a certain angle θ depending on the parameter k. Simulations show that the node interference in our new structure is indeed smaller than the structure proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some prior arts in topology control, and summarize some preferred properties of network topology for unicast and broadcast. Section 3 presents an improved algorithm to build a degree-bounded planar spanner with Θ-separation property. We then propose, in Section 4, the first communication efficient algorithm to construct planar spanner with bounded-degree and low weight. We study the expected interference of various structures in Section 5. In Section 6, we briefly study how to dynamically update the structure if nodes are mobile. In Section 7, we conduct extensive simulations to validate our theoretical results. Finally, we conclude our paper in Section 8.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Energy-Efficient Unicast Topology</head><p>Several structures have been proposed for topology control in wireless ad hoc networks. The relative neighborhood graph, denoted by RN G(V ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, consists of all edges uv such that the intersection of two circles centered at u and v and with radius uv does not contain any vertex w from the set V . The Gabriel graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> GG(V ) contains an edge uv if and only if disk(u, v) contains no other points of V , where disk(u, v) is the disk with edge uv as a diameter. For convenience, we also denote GG and RN G as the intersection of GG(V ) and RN G(V ) with U DG(V ) respectively. Both GG and RN G are planar, are connected, and contain the Euclidean minimum spanning tree(EM ST ) of V if UDG is connected. RNG is not power efficient for unicast, since the power stretch factor of RNG is n -1 in the worst case <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> and not bounded by a constant even for n nodes randomly distributed (our proof is similar to the proof in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> and omitted here due to space limit). Both RNG and GG are not degree-bounded. The Yao graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref> with an integer parameter k &gt; 6, denoted by --→ Y G k , is defined as follows. At each node u, any k equally-separated rays originated at u define k cones. In each cone, choose the shortest edge uv ∈ U DG(V ) among all edges emanated from u, if there is any, and add a directed link -→ uv. Ties are broken arbitrarily or by ID. The resulting directed graph is called the Yao graph. It is well-known that the Yao structure is power efficient for unicast. Several variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> of the Yao structure could have bounded logical node degree also. However, all Yao related structures are not planar.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> proposed the Cone Based Topology Control (CBTC) algorithm to first focus on several desirable properties, in particular being an energy spanner with bounded degree. It is basically similar to the Yao structure for topology control. Each node u finds a power p u,α such that in every cone of degree α surrounding u, there is some node that u can reach with power p u,α . Here, nevertheless, we assume that there is a node reachable from u by the maximum power in that cone. Notice that the number of cones to be considered in the traditional Yao structure is a constant k. However, unlike the Yao structure, for each node u, the number of cones needed to be considered in the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> is 2∆, where each neighboring node v could contribute two cones on both side of segment uv. Then the graph G α contains all edges uv such that u can communicate with v using power p u,α . They proved that, if α ≤ 5π 6 and the UDG is connected, then graph G α is a connected graph. On the other hand, if α &gt; 5π 6 , they showed that the connectivity of Gα is not guaranteed by giving some counterexample <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Unlike the Yao structure, the final topology G α is not necessarily a bounded degree graph.</p><p>Bose et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> proposed a centralized method with running time O(n log n) to build a degree-bounded planar spanner for a two-dimensional point set. It constructs a planar tspanner with low-weight for a given nodes set V , for t = (1 + π) • C del 10.02, such that the node degree is bounded from above by 27. Hereafter, we use C del &lt; 2.6 to denote the spanning ratio of the Delaunay triangulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>. However, a straightforward distributed implementation of this centralized method takes O(n 2 ) communications in the worst case for a set V of n nodes.</p><p>Wang and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> proposed the first efficient distributed algorithm to build a degree-bounded planar spanner BP S for wireless ad hoc networks. Though their method can achieve three desirable features: planar, degree-bounded, and power efficient, the theoretical bound on the node degree of their structure is a large constant. For example, when α = π/6, the theoretical bound on node degree is 25. In addition, the communication cost of their method can be very high, although it is O(n) theoretically, which is achieved by applying the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> to collect 2-hop neighbors information. The hidden constant is large: it is several hundreds.</p><p>Recently, Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> proposed two methods to construct degree-bounded power spanner, by applying the ordered Yao structures on Gabriel graph. They achieved better performance with much lower communication cost, compared with the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. One method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> only costs 3n messages for the construction, and guarantees that there are at most one neighbor node in each of the k = 9 equal-sized cones.</p><p>Notice that the structures constructed by the methods proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42]</ref> are not guaranteed to be low-weighted. Both structures are planar and degree-bounded. The structure constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> is only a power-spanner, while the structure constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> is also a length-spanner. Notice that it is known that a length-spanner is always a power spanner <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose the first method to construct a single topology that is planar, length-spanner, bounded-degree, and lowweighted.</p><p>In summary, for energy efficient unicast routing, the topology is preferred to have following features:</p><p>1. Power Spanner: Formally speaking, a subgraph H is called a power spanner of a graph G if there is a positive real constant ρ such that for any two nodes, the power consumption of the shortest path in H is at most ρ times of the power consumption of the shortest path in G. Here ρ is called the power stretch factor or spanning ratio.</p><p>2. Degree Bounded: It is also desirable that the logical node degree in the constructed topology is bounded from above by a small constant. A small node degree could reduce the MAC-level contention and interference, also may help to mitigate the well known hidden and exposed terminal problems. In addition, a structure with a small degree will improve the overall network throughout <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Bounded degree structures also find applications in Bluetooth wireless networks since a master node can have only 7 active slaves.</p><p>3. Planar: A network topology is also preferred to be planar (no two edges crossing each other in the graph) to enable some localized routing algorithms work correctly and efficiently, such as Greedy Face Routing (GFG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, Adaptive Face Routing(AFR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, and Greedy Other Adaptive Face Routing (GOAFR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Notice that with planar network topology as the underlying routing structure, these localized routing protocols guarantee the message delivery without using a routing table: each intermediate node can decide which logical neighboring node to forward the packet using only local information and the position of the source and the destination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Energy-Efficient Broadcast Topology</head><p>Broadcast is also a very important operation in wireless ad hoc/sensor networks, as it provides an efficient way of communication that does not require global information and functions well with topology changes. For example, many unicast routing protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref> for wireless multi-hop networks use broadcast in the stage of route discovery. Similarly, several information dissemination protocols in wireless sensor networks use some forms of broadcast/multicast for solicitation or collection of sensor information <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>. Since sensor networks mainly <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> use broadcast for communication, how to deliver messages to all the wireless devices in a scalable and power-efficient manner has drawn more and more attention. Not until recently have research efforts been made to devise power-efficient broadcast structures for wireless ad hoc networks.</p><p>Notice that, a broadcast routing protocol can be interpreted as flood-based broadcasting on a certain subgraph of the original communication networks, since any broadcast routing can be viewed as an arborescence (a directed tree) T , rooted at the source node of the broadcasting, that spans all nodes. The tree T contains a directed edge -→ uv if node v received the first copy of the broadcast data from node u. Once a broadcast structure H is constructed, the broadcast is a simple flooding on top of H: once a node v got the broadcast message from any of its logical neighbors, say u, for the first time, it will simply forward it to all its logical neighbors (maybe except the node u) either through one-to-one or oneto-all communications. Let f H (p) denote the transmission power of the node p required by broadcasting message on top of a broadcast structure H. We assume that the tree H is a directed graph rooted at the source of the broadcasting session: link -→ pq ∈ H denotes that node p forwarded message to node q. For any leaf node p of H, clearly we have f H (p) = 0 since it does not have to forward the data to any other node. For any internal node p of H, fH (p) = max-→ pq∈H pq β under our energy model if an one-to-all communication model is used; and f H (p) = P -→ pq∈H pq β under our energy model if an one-to-one communication model is used. The total energy required by H is P p∈V fH (p). In the literature, the one-to-all communication model is typically assumed.</p><p>Minimum-energy broadcast routing in a simple ad hoc networking environment has been addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>. It is known <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> that the minimum-energy broadcast routing problem is NP-hard, i.e., it cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P=NP. Three greedy heuristics were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> for the minimum-energy broadcast routing problem: EMST (minimum spanning tree), SPT (shortest-path tree), and BIP (broadcasting incremental power). Wan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref> showed that the approximation ratios of EMST and BIP are between 6 and 12 and between 13  3 and 12 respectively; on the other hand, the approximation ratio of SPT is at least n 2 , where n is the number of nodes. The approximation ratio of EMST is improved to 8 recently by Flammini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. Unfortunately, none of the above structures can be formed and updated using only linear number of messages, nor locally.</p><p>RNG, which can be constructed locally, has been used for broadcasting in wireless ad hoc networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. However, an example was given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> to show that the total energy used by broadcasting on RNG could be about O(n β ) times of the minimum-energy used by an optimum method. Several practical broadcasting protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref> are proposed recently, however, all of them did not provide their theoretical performance bound on the energy consumption. In fact, Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> showed that, no deterministic localized algorithm can find a structure that approximates the total energy consumption of broadcasting within a constant factor of the optimum. Furthermore, in the worst case, for any broadcast based on a locally constructed and connected structure, there is a network configuration of n nodes such that its energy consumption is Θ(n β-1 ) times the optimum. On the other hand, given any low-weighted structure H, i.e., ω(H) ≤ O(1) • ω(EM ST ), they proved the following lemma</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Lemma 1. [30] ω β (H) ≤ O(n β-1 ) • ω β (EM ST ), where H is any low-weighted structure.</formula><p>Here ω(G) is the total length of the links in G, i.e., ω(G) = P uv∈G uv , and ω β (G) is the total power consumption of links in G, i.e., ω β (G) = P uv∈G uv β . Consequently, lowweighted structure is asymptotically optimal for broadcasting among any connected structures built in a localized manner. Notice that, the above analysis is based on the assumption that every link is used during the broadcast (one-to-one communication), such as using the TDMA scheme. Even considering that the broadcast signal sent by a node can be received by all nodes in its transmission region simultaneously (one-to-all communication), the above claim is also correct. The reason is basically as follows. Let B s (H) be the total energy consumed by broadcasting on a structure H with sender s using the one-to-all communication model. Clearly, any flood-based broadcast based on a structure H consumes energy at most P e i ∈H e β i if the message received by an intermediate node v is not forwarded to its parent, i.e., the node that just forwarded this message to v; and the total energy is at most 2 P e i ∈H e β i if an intermediate node v may also forward the message to its parent. On the other hand, the total energy B s (H) used by any structure H is at least <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P e i ∈EM ST e β i /12</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">B s (EM ST ) ≥ X e i ∈EM ST e β i /12 = ω β (EM ST )/12.</formula><p>Then, if H is a low-weighted structure, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Bs(H) ≤ 2 X e i ∈H e β i = O(n β-1 ) • ω β (EM ST ) ≤ 12 • O(n β-1 ) • B s (EM ST )</formula><p>Recall that Bs(EM ST ) is no more than a constant (≤ 8) times of the optimum in an one-to-all communication model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>. Consequently, we have the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 2. The broadcast based on any low-weighted structure H consumes energy at most O(n β-<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> ) times of the optimum in both one-to-one and one-to-all communication models. And the bound O(n β-1 ) is tight.</p><p>In summary, to enable energy efficient broadcasting, the constructed topology is also preferred to be low-weighted, in addition to the three properties for unicast: 4. Low Weighted: the total link length of final topology is within a constant factor of that of EM ST .</p><p>Recently, several localized algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> have been proposed to construct low-weighted structures, which indeed approximate the energy efficiency of EMST as the network density increasing. However, none of them is power efficient for unicast routing. In this paper we will present the first efficient distributed method to construct a planar, bounded degree spanner that is also low-weighted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">POWER-EFFICIENT UNICAST: SPANNER, PLANAR AND BOUNDED-DEGREE</head><p>The ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a unified topology that is power-efficient for both unicast and broadcast, in addition to be planar and have a constant bounded logical node degree. To achieve this ultimate goal, in this section, we first present a new method that can construct a power-efficient topology for unicast. We will prove that the constructed structure is a power-spanner, planar and has bounded node degree. Furthermore, it has an extra property: any two neighbors of each node are separated by at least a certain angle θ. Hereafter, we call it the Θ-separation property. As we will see later that this property further reduces the interference, especially when adopting directional antennas for transmission. This property also makes the proof much easier that the structure constructed in the next section is also power-efficient for broadcast.</p><p>One possible way to construct a degree-bounded planar power spanner is to apply the Yao structure on Gabriel graph, since GG is already planar and has a power stretch factor exactly 1. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Li et al.</ref> showed that the final structure by directly applying the Yao structure on GG is a planar power spanner, called Y aoGG, but its in-degree can be as large as O(n), as in the example shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1(b)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, Song et. al proposed two new methods to bound node degree by applying the ordered Yao structures on Gabriel graph. The structure SY aoGG in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> guarantees that there is at most one neighbor node in each of the k equal-sized cones. In this section, we will propose an improved algorithm to further reduce the medium contention by selecting less communication neighbors and separating neighbors wider.</p><p>Before we give the algorithm, we first define a concept called θ-Dominating Region.</p><p>Definition 1. θ-Dominating Region: For each neighbor node v of a node u, the θ-dominating region of v is the 2θ-cone emanated from u, with the edge uv as its axis.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> illustrates the θ-dominating region of a node v in the transmission disk of node u. Using the concept of θ-dominating region instead of absolute cone partition in SYaoGG <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, we are able to prove that any two neighbors of each node are guaranteed to be separated by at least θ u v θ an angle θ. The final topology will be called SΘGG. Intuitively, the communication interference in SΘGG will be smaller than the interference in SY aoGG, which is also verified later by simulations as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(c)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(d)</ref>. In each step, it keeps the current pointed neighbor w in the list, while deletes every conflicted node v in the remainder of the list. Here a node v is conflicted with w means that node v is in the θdominating region of node w. Here θ = 2π/k (k ≥ 9) is an adjustable parameter. Node u then marks itself Black, i.e. processed, and notifies each deleted neighboring node v in N (u) by a broadcasting message UpdateN. 3: Once a node v receives the message UpdateN from a neighbor u in N (v), it checks whether itself is in the nodes set for deleting: if so, it deletes the sending node u from list N (v), otherwise, marks u as BLACK in N (v). 4: When all nodes are processed, all selected links {uv|v ∈ N (u), ∀v ∈ GG} form the final network topology, denoted by SΘGG. Each node can shrink its transmission range as long as it sufficiently reaches its farthest neighbor in the final topology.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Algorithm</formula><p>The basic idea of our method is as follows. Since the Gabriel graph is planar and power-spanner, we will remove some links of GG to bound the nodal degree while not destroying the power-spanner property. The basic approach of bounding the nodal degree is to only keep some shortest link in the θ-Dominating region for every node. We process the nodes in a certain order. A node is marked White if it is unprocessed and is marked Black if it is processed. Originally all nodes are marked White. Initially, a node elects itself to start processing its neighbors if its ID 1 is smaller than all its unprocessed logical neighbors in the Gabriel graph. Assume that a node u is to be processed. We further assume that there are already some processed logical neighboring nodes, In our new algorithm, a data structure will be used: N (u) is the set of neighbors of each node u in the final topology, which is initialized as the set of neighbor nodes in GG. We are now ready to present our Algorithm 1, which constructs a bounded degree planar power spanner.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">say v 1 , • • • , v t ,</formula><p>Notice that the final topology based on Yao graph, such as SY aoGG <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, may vary as the choice of the direction of cones varies. Here, SΘGG does not rely on the absolute cone partition by adopting the new concept of θ-dominating region. Hence, given the point set V , SΘGG is unique. In addition, the average node degree, interference and transmission range of SΘGG is expected to be smaller than SY aoGG too. Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that the theoretical bound on the spanning ratio for SΘGG, that we can prove, is same as SY aoGG, as proved later in Theorem 4. Lemma 3. Graph SΘGG is connected if the underlying graph GG is connected. Furthermore, given any two nodes u and v, there exists a path {u, t1, ..., tr, v} connecting them such that all edges have length less than √ 2 uv .</p><p>Proof. We prove the connectivity by contradiction. Suppose a link uv is the shortest link in UDG whose connectivity is broken by Algorithm 1. W.l.o.g, assume the link uv is removed while processing node u, because of the existence of another node w.</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, there are only two cases (ties are broken by ID) that the link uv can be removed by node u: cedures first. For example, we can use the RTS/CTS mechanism provided in the MAC layer to achieve this: the node that first successfully sent a RTS signal within its one-hop neighborhood will be elected. In this paper, we use ID just for the sake of an easy presentation. Case a: uw &lt; uv . Notice that ∠vuw ≤ θ &lt; π/4, hence wv &lt; uv . In other words, both link wv and uw are smaller than link uv. Since there are no paths u v according to the assumption, either the path u w or v w is broken. That is to say, either the connectivity of wv or uw is broken. Thus, uv is not the shortest link whose connectivity is broken, it is a contradiction. Case b: uw &gt; uv . It happens only when node w is processed and node v is unprocessed. Similarly, ∠vuw ≤ θ &lt; π/4 &lt; ∠uwv (otherwise ∠uvw &gt; π/2 violates the Gabriel graph property), hence wv &lt; uv . Since node w is a processed node and node u decides to keep link uw, the link uw will be kept in SΘGG. According to assumption that u and v are not connected in SΘGG, w and v are not connected either. That is to say, uv is not the shortest link whose connectivity is broken. It is a contradiction. This finishes the proof of connectivity. Notice that the above proof implies that the shortest link uv in UDG is kept in the final topology. Clearly, the shortest link uv is in GG. Link uv cannot be removed in our algorithm due to the case illustrated by Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 (a)</ref>. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that uv is removed due to the case (b) where uw &gt; uv and w is processed when processing u. Then wv &lt; uv is a contradiction to that uv is the shortest link in UDG.</p><p>We then show by induction that, given any link uv in UDG, there is a path connecting them using edges with length at most √ 2 uv . Assume uv is removed when processing u and due to the existence of link uw. We build a path connecting u and v by concatenating u w and w v, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. It is not difficult to see that the longest segment of the path is less than √ 2 uv , which occurs in case (b). In this case, the link uw must be kept because both endpoints are processed, and uw &lt; √ 2 uv . This finishes the proof.</p><p>The property that for any link uv, there is a path connecting them such that the links on the path have length at most √ 2 uv is crucial for our later proof that our Algorithm 2 builds a low-weighted bounded degree planar spanner.</p><p>Theorem 4. The structure SΘGG has node degree at most k -1 and is planar power spanner with neighbors Θseparated. Its power stretch factor is at most ρ</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">= √ 2 β 1-(2 √ 2 sin π k ) β ,</formula><p>where k ≥ 9 is an adjustable parameter.</p><p>Proof. The proof would be similar with the proof of SY aoGG in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. The only difference is that, we used the concept of dominating cones instead of Yao graph. While the power stretch factor remains the same theoretically, the degree bound is reduced from k to k-1. Obviously, the links in SΘGG are Θ-separated, in other words, the direction of any two neighbors of a node is Θ-separated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">UNIFIED POWER-EFFICIENT TOPOLOGY: DEGREE-BOUNDED PLANAR SPANNER WITH LOW WEIGHT</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, so far, no communication efficient topology control algorithm has achieved all the desirable properties summarized in Section 2: degree-bounded, planar, power spanner, low-weighted. Those properties are not only interesting in terms of computational geometry, but also have important applications in wireless ad hoc networks, as shown in section 2: enable energy efficient unicast and broadcast routings in same structure. Recall that, spanner property ensures that an energy efficient path is always kept for any pair of nodes, hence it is a necessary condition to support energy efficient unicast. While low-weighted structure is optimal for broadcast among any connected structures built locally. Unfortunately, all the known spanners, including Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, GG <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and the recent developed degreebounded planar spanners BP S <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, SY aoGG, OrdY aoGG <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>  It is worth to clarify that, in this section, we are interested in finding a subgraph to enable efficient broadcast routings, even based on the simple-flooding method. We do not aim to substitute the known broadcasting protocols. In fact, the methods used in those broadcasting protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref> can be applied on the low-weighted structures to conserve more energy. The main contribution of low-weighted structure is that it bounds the worst case performance for broadcasting.</p><p>Several known localized algorithms are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> to generate low-weighted graphs. In their algorithms, given a certain structure G, for any two links uv and xy of a graph G, they remove xy if xy is the longest link among quadrilateral uvxy. They proved that the final structures are low-weighted if G is RNG' <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> or LMST 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Obviously, they are not spanners. In fact, their techniques can not be applied on spanner graph to bound the weight without losing its spanner property. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates an example by applying their algorithms to SΘGG. The node ID of v i is i,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∠v 1 v 3 v 4 &lt; θ and v 1 v 3 &gt; v 3 v 4 &gt; max( v 1 v 2 , v 2 v 4 ). While constructing SΘGG, first node θ-ε v 1 v2 v 4 v 3</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>: The graph could be disconnected if applying the previous method to build low-weighted structure on SΘGG. v 1 selects v 1 v 2 and v 1 v 3 as its incident logical links and node v 2 selects v 2 v 1 and v 2 v 4 , then node v 3 selects v 3 v 1 and deletes v 3 v 4 . Hence v 3 v 4 / ∈ SΘGG. If applying the rule described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>, the link v1v3 will also be deleted because v1v3 &gt; max( v1v2 , v2v4 , v3v4 ). Then the graph will be disconnected. Then we can conclude that simple extension of methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> on top of SΘGG does not even guarantee the connectivity, nor to say power-spanner property.</p><p>Indeed, the spanner property and low-weight property are not easy to be achieved at same time. Intuitively, the spanner property requires to keep more links, while the lowweight property requires to keep less links from original graph. In the following, we will describe a novel algorithm to build a low-weighted structure from SΘGG, while keeping enough links to guarantee the power efficiency. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>  Algorithm 2 presents our new method that constructs a bounded degree planar power-spanner that is also lowweighted. Although our algorithm produces only powerspanner here, it can be extended to produce also the lengthspanner if it is needed. To get a length-spanner, we construct the structure LDel 2 (defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>) instead of the Gabriel graph used in our algorithm. It was proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> that LDel 2 is a planar, length-spanner, and can be constructed using only O(n) messages. The basic idea of our new method is as follows. Since the graph SΘGG is already planar, power-spanner, and has bounded-degree, we will remove some of its edges to guarantee that the resulting topology is low-weighted while not destroying the power-spanner property. Notice that removing edges will not break the planar property and the bounded-degree property. In all previous methods presented in the literature, a node x decides to remove or keep links that are incident on x, i.e., it only cares about the incident edges. While, in the method presented here, a node x will decide whether to keep or remove links for not only incident links, but also the links that are incident on one of its neighbors. To guarantee a lowweight property the methods presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">remove 1 u 1 u 2 u 3 u n v n v 3 v v 2 1 u 1 u 2 u 3 u n v n v 3 v v 2 1 u 1 u 2 u 3 u n v n v 3 v v (a) original graph SΘGG</formula><p>(b) graph resulted using method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> (c) graph based on our method Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>: A sequence of links are recursively removed. Here solid and dashed links represent the links from the original graph and the dashed links represent the links that are removed by a topology control algorithm, while solid links represent the final structure constructed by a certain method. Here we assume that uivi = R and the ID of link uivi is less than the ID of link ui+1vi+1. some links from a certain structure such that the remaining links satisfy the isolation property: for each remaining link xy, the disk centered at the midpoint of xy using a radius proportional to xy does not intersect with any other remaining links. They achieved this property by removing a link xy if there is another link uv such that xy is the longest link in the quadrilateral uvyx. However, this simple heuristic cannot guarantee the spanner property. Consider a link xy in some shortest path from s to t. See Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> for an illustration. Link xy will be removed due to the existence of link uv. Link uv could also later be removed due to the existence of another link u 1 v 1 , which could also be removed due to the existence of another link u2v2, and so on. See Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> (b) for an illustration of the situation where a sequence of links will be removed: all links u i v i , for i ≥ 2 will be removed. Consequently, the shortest path connecting nodes u n and v n could be arbitrarily long in the resulting graph. Thus, instead of blindly removing all such links xy whenever it is the longest link in a quadrilateral uvyx, we will keep such a link when some links in its certain neighborhood have been removed. To do so, among all links from a graph, such as SΘGG, that is planar, bounded-degree, power-spanner, we implicitly define an independent set of links. A link is in this independent set, which will be kept at last, if it has the smallest ID among unselected links from its neighborhood. Specifically, we implicitly define a virtual graph G over all links in SΘGG: the vertex set of G is the set of all links in SΘGG and two links xy and uv of SΘGG are connected in G if one end-point of uv is in the transmission range of one end-point of link xy (they will interfere with each other if transmit simultaneously). For example, the links u 1 v 1 and u3v3 are not independent in network topology illustrated by Figure <ref type="figure">6 (a)</ref>; while the links u1v1 and unvn are independent. Notice that links u 1 v 1 and u 1 u 2 are independent since they do not form a four vertices convex hull. Notice that in our method presented later, we did not explicitly define such graph G , nor compute the maximal independent set of such graph G explicitly. We will prove that the selected independent set of links in SΘGG indeed is low-weighted and still preserves the power-spanner property, although with a larger power spanning ratio. Our method will keep link u1v1 since it has the smallest ID among all links that are not independent. When link u 1 v 1 is kept, all links that are not independent (here are u 2 v 2 and u 3 v 3 ) will be removed. Then link u 4 v 4 will be kept. The above procedure will be repeated until all links are processed. The final structure resulted from our method is illustrated by Figure <ref type="figure">6 (c)</ref>.</p><p>Obviously, the construction is consistent for two endpoints of each edge: if an edge uv is kept by node u, then it is also kept by node v. The ID of a link uv is defined as following: Thus, LSΘGG has a power spanning ratio ≤ 2ρ + 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ID(uv) = { uv , min(ID(u), ID(v)), max(ID(u), ID(v))}</formula><p>We then show that graph LSΘGG is low-weighted. To study the total weight of this structure, inspired by the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, we will show that the edges in LSΘGG satisfy the isolation property <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Theorem 6. The structure LSΘGG is low-weighted.</p><p>See the appendix for the proof. We continue to analyze the communication cost of Algorithm 1 and 2. First, clearly, building GG in Algorithm 1 can be done using only n messages: each message contains the ID and geometry position of a node. Second, to build SΘGG, initially, the number of edges, say p, in Gabriel Graph is p ∈ [n, 3n -6] since it is a planar graph. Remember that we will remove some edges from GG to bound the logical node degree. Clearly, there are at most 2n such removed edges since we keep at least n -1 edges from the connectivity of the final structure. Thus the total number of messages, say q, used to inform the deleted edges from GG is at most q ∈ [0, 2n]. Notice that p -q is the edges left in the final structure, which is at least n -1 and at most 3n -6. Thirdly, in the marking process described in Algorithm 2, the communication cost of broadcasting its incident edges (or its neighbors) and updating link status are both 2(p -q). Therefore the total communication cost is n + 4p -3q ∈ [5n, 13n]. Then the following theorem directly follows.</p><p>Theorem 7. Assuming that both the ID and the geometry position can be represented by log n bits each, the total number of messages during constructing the structure LSΘGG is in the range of <ref type="bibr">[5n, 13n]</ref>, where each message has at most O(log n) bits.</p><p>Compared with previous known low-weighted structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>, LSΘGG not only achieves more desirable properties, but also costs much less messages during construction. To construct LSΘGG, we only need to collect the information E2(x) which costs at most 6n messages. Our algorithm can be generally applied to any known degree-bounded planar spanner to make it low-weighted while keeping all its previous properties, except increasing the spanning ratio from ρ to 2ρ + 1 theoretically.</p></div>

For average performance analysis, we consider a set of wireless nodes distributed in a two-dimensional unit square region. The nodes are distributed according to either the uniform random point process or homogeneous Poisson process. A point set process is said to be a uniform random point process, denoted by Xn, in a region Ω if it consists of n independent points each of which is uniformly and randomly distributed over Ω. The standard probabilistic model of homogeneous Poisson process is characterized by the property that the number of nodes in a region is a random variable depending only on the area (or volume in higher dimensions) of the region. In other words,</p><p>• The probability that there are exactly k nodes appearing in any region Ψ of area A is (λA) k k!</p><p>• e -λA . • For any region Ψ, the conditional distribution of nodes in Ψ given that exactly k nodes in the region is joint uniform.</p><p>Definition 2.

The physical node degree of u in H is defined as the number of nodes inside the disk disk (u, r H (u)). The node interference, denoted by I H (u), of a node u in a structure H is simply the physical node degree of u. The maximum node interference of a structure H is defined as max u I H (u).

That is to say, with high probability, nπd 2  n is in the range of [log n -log log n, 2 log n].</p></div>

Thus, the expected number of nodes lying inside a region with area A is E(m(A)) = δA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DYNAMIC UPDATE</head><p>The methods presented so far have assumed that the wireless nodes are static. This is true for some certain wireless networks such as the wireless sensor networks. Obviously, dynamic maintenance of the topology is an important issue for a dynamic wireless ad hoc network, after the construction of the unified energy-efficient topology. Two major events may cause the topology "obsoleted": 1) topology changes due to node moving, node joining or leaving, node failure; and 2) distance changes when nodes are moving. Notice that the distance clearly change frequently. It will be very expensive if we respond quickly to all possible distance changes. Therefore, a dynamic update method for the network topology will respond to the topology change spontaneously: topology should be updated carefully when a certain used link in the topology is no longer a physical link in the network. On the other hand, it will respond to the distance change only when the change is over some threshold. Assume that there is a timer set for topology maintenance: when the timer expires, each node will check whether it needs to update the topology. We propose to set two control parameters α2 &gt; 1 &gt; α1 &gt; 0. Assume that the nodes are moving and let e u be the new position of a node u after the timer for topology-maintenance expires. Let u be the position of node u when the last topology-maintenance is performed and LSΘGG be the corresponding updated topology. In our topology control implementation, a node u will not perform the topology update if for every logical neighbor v, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">α 1 • uv ≤ e ue v ≤ α 2 • uv .</formula><p>Notice that if this condition is hold for all nodes, then the "old" topology LSΘGG we currently have is still a lowweighted, bounded degree, planar spanner for the current node configuration. The planar property and the bounded degree property clearly hold. We only need to show that that structure LSΘGG is still low-weighted and a power-spanner for the new node positions. We first prove that it is still a power-spanner, although not the same structure if we apply our method using the current positions of all nodes. For the presentation convenience, let U DG be the network formed by all nodes u at their current position e u; Let U DG be the network formed by all nodes u at their previous position u when the last topology updating is performed.</p><p>Theorem 11. Structure LSΘGG is a power-spanner for the new network modelled by U DG.</p><p>Proof. Consider any link uv. In the current network U DG, there is a shortest path connecting them with the minimum power consumption. For each link xy on this shortest path, we have xy ≤ e xe y /α1. Notice that it is possible that link xy is not in the topology LSΘGG. Since LSΘGG is a power-spanner for U DG, there must exist a path Π in LSΘGG connecting x and y using total power at most (2ρ + 1) • xy β , which is at most 2ρ+1 Thus, the topological structure LSΘGG still has a powerspanning ratio at most</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">α β 2 • 2ρ+1 α β 1</formula><p>for the current network modelled by U DG. This finishes the proof.</p><p>We then show that the structure LSΘGG is still lowweighted, i.e., the total edge length of the topological structure LSΘGG under the new positions of nodes is still within a constant factor of the total edge length of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of the new network modelled by U DG. </p><formula xml:id="formula_19">α1 • st = α 1 • P st∈ EM ST st ≥ α 1 • P uv∈EM ST uv</formula><p>The last inequality is due to tree EM ST is the minimum spanning tree when each node u has a position u.

Most of the existing dynamic updating algorithms are invoked periodically, while some algorithms perform the updating only when it is required (i.e., on-demand). Our algorithm can adapt and combine both of these two update methods. If no major topology changes or no remarkable distance changes, no update will be performed until some pre-set timer expires. In other words, we perform our algorithm periodically with a pre-set time. The time could be set quite long depending on the mobility pattern of the wireless network. This kind of global update also insures the load balance throughout the network. But for some major topology change (such as a broken physical link used in the topology) or tremendous change of distance, an on-demand update will be performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">PERFORMANCE ON RANDOM NETWORKS</head><p>In this section we evaluate the performance of our new energy efficient unicast and broadcast topology SΘGG by conducting simulations. In our simulations, we randomly generate a set V of n wireless nodes and U DG(V ), then test the connectivity of U DG(V ). If it is connected, we construct different topologies on U DG(V ), including our new topology SΘGG and some other well-known planar topologies including GG <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, RN G <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, and SY aoGG <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. Then we measure the sparseness, the power efficiency and the interference of these topologies.</p><p>In the simulation results presented here, we generate n random wireless nodes in a 16 × 16 unit squares; the parameter k is set to 9 when we construct SY aoGG and SΘGG; the transmission range of each node is set to 4 unit. Typically, a unit represents about 50 meters here. We test the power efficiency, and node degree of these planar structures by varying the node number n from 30 to 360. For each number n = 30i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 12, 500 vertex sets are generated. Given a sampled network, we will first compute the quality measure for this graph, e.g., we compute the average (and the maximum) spanning ratio of the spanning ratios of all pairs of nodes; we compute the average (and the maximum) (physical and logical) node degree of all nodes. We then compute the average of these performances (e.g., average spanning ratio, average node degree, maximum node degree) over all these 500 randomly sampled networks. The most important design metric of wireless network topology is perhaps the power efficiency, as it directly affects both the node and the network lifetime. We first study power stretch factors of all structures, which are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. In our simulations we set power attenuation constant β = 2. It shows that all power spanners (GG, SY aoGG, SΘGG, LSΘGG) indeed have a small power spanning ratio in practice: less than 1.021, while RN G, LM ST 2 , EM ST are less power efficient as proved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Power Efficiency for Unicast</head><p>Notice that RNG has a length spanning ratio Ω( q log n log log n ) even for n randomly distributed nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, which implies that the length spanning ratios of LM ST 2 , EM ST are also at least Ω( q log n log log n ) since RNG contains them as subgraphs. Similar proofs can show that these structures also have arbitrarily large power spanning ratios (in the order of Ω(</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">q log n log log n ))</formula><p>for n nodes randomly distributed in a square region. The proof details are omitted here due to space limit. The curves in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> do show such a trend of increasing power spanning ratios for structures EMST and LMST 2 . Hence, for unicast application, we only need to compare the performances among power spanners. The average power stretch factors of LSΘGG are at the same level of those of GG though LSΘGG is sparser and low-weighted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Number of Communication Neighbors</head><p>In unicast routings, each node is preferred to have a bounded number of communication neighbors. Otherwise a node with a large logical degree may have to communicate with many nodes directly. This increases the interference and the overhead at this node. The overhead could be caused by maintaining the status of these logical neighbors locally. The average and maximum logical node degrees of each topology are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> (a) and (b). It shows that SΘGG and LSΘGG have less number of edges (average logical degrees) than SY aoGG and GG. Our new structure is sparser than previous structures with bounded powerspanning ratios, but denser than other structures (RNG, EMST, LMST 2 ). The increasing/decreasing values as n increases in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10 (b),</ref><ref type="figure">(d</ref>) and (f) are caused by the small number of simulations. Notice that, to get the same confidence level, measuring the maximum value needs more simulations than measuring the average value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Interference</head><p>Beside the logical node degrees, we are also interested in the physical node degree (or called node interference) that is defined as follows. For each node u, let uv = LH (u) be the longest link incident in u in a structure H. The node interference of u is defined as the number of nodes w with uw ≤ uv . This is the total number of nodes that could cause direct interference with u. The average and maximum node interference of each topology are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> (c) and (d). They are higher than the logical node degrees as expected, however they follow the same pattern of curves. The average node interference increases first when the number of nodes increases, then it becomes stable. The average node interferences of LSΘGG, SΘGG, SY aoGG are indeed bounded, which are around 6, 6, 6.5 in our simulations; the average node interferences of RNG, EMST, and LMST 2 are smaller but they are not efficient structures. The maximum node interference increases slightly while the number of wireless nodes grows: it follows the curve of O(ln n) as we proved. As predicted in section 3, both average and maximum node interference of SΘGG are lower than SY aoGG.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Performance for Broadcasting</head><p>After forming a sparse structure, say H, each node can shrink its transmission energy as long as it is enough to cover the longest adjacent neighbor in the structure. By this way, we define the node transmission power for each node u in a structure as the minimum power needed to support its longest link LH (u) = uv in H. Here we assume that the node transmission energy of u is set as uv β . Recall the discussion in section 2.2, once a structure H is constructed, the broadcast is a simple flooding on top of H: every node will forward the received broadcast message (from one of its logical neighbors) once to all its other logical neighbors in the structure. Hence minimum-energy broadcast is to decide the logical neighbors (thus the transmission range) of each node, so that the total energy consumed during broadcasting is minimized.</p><p>For broadcast we will not study the total energy consumption of all nodes since this depends on the number of nodes: more nodes will consume more energy, which makes it difficult to study the overall performance of a structure when the number of nodes varies. Instead, we will concentrate on the power consumed by individual nodes. The average and the maximum node transmission energy of each topology are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> (e) and (f), which decreases as the network density increases as expected. The power assignment based on LSΘGG is only slightly larger than RN G, which has been widely used for broadcasting previously; the reason is that LSΘGG need more links to guarantee small power spanning ratio theoretically. The structure LSΘGG produces the smallest average node power for broadcast among all structures with theoretical guaranteed performance for unicast and broadcast. Our theoretical results are corroborated in the simulations: low-weighted structure is indeed close to optimal for broadcast among all locally constructed structures. Moreover, simulation results in all charts also show that the performances of our new topologies LSΘGG are stable when the number of nodes changes.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Energy conservation is critical to the network performance in wireless ad hoc networks. Topology control has drawn significant research interests from different approaches for energy conservation in wireless ad hoc networks. In this paper, we proposed an efficient algorithm in which all wireless nodes maintain a network topology, called LSΘGG, which is the first known single structure to support both energy efficient unicast and broadcast. We gave distributed method to construct it with 5n to 13n messages. We proved that, for unicast, it has following attractive properties: power spanner, bounded node degree, planar, and low average interference. Furthermore, the total energy of broadcast based on this structure is also within a constant factor of the power consumption of broadcast based on any locally constructed topology, although it is not within a constant factor of the global optimum. Previous known communication efficient topology control algorithms can only achieve part of those nice properties, especially, none of them can support both efficient unicast and broadcast simultaneously.</p><p>There are still lots of challenging questions we did not address in this paper. First of all, throughout this paper, we assumed that the emission power is the major component of the power consumption. In some devices, the emission power is at the same level of the power needed for being idle or to receive packets. It is then necessary to design a structure with theoretically proven worst case performance under this new energy model when the receiving power is not negligible. Secondly, an implicit assumption of the our power model is that each node can adjust its power to any specific value. In practice, the transmitter has to choose among a set of given discrete power values. It is already known that under this discrete power model, the minimum energy broadcast problem is still NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> and a method with approximation ratio O(n ) was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> (the ratio is O(log 3 n) if identical nodes are used). Then a problem remaining is to close the gap between this huge ratio and the constant approximation ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> when the power is continuously adjustable. Thirdly, although the algorithms proposed in this paper use O(n) messages, each with O(log n) bits, they are not localized algorithms. Recall that, a distributed algorithm is localized if it runs in constant time independent of the size of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>. It would be interesting to study what kind of properties can be achieved locally (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>), and what kind of properties cannot be achieved locally (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>). If a certain combined property cannot be achieved locally, what will be the best achievable trade-off between time and approximation ratio. Currently, the locally achievable geometry properties include: planar spanner <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, bounded degree spanner <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, bounded degree and low weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, k-fault tolerant <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX</head><p>Das et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> proved that if a set of line segments E satisfies the isolation property, then ω(E) = O(1) • ω(SM T ). Here SMT is the Steiner minimum tree over the end points of E, and total edge weight of SMT is no more than that of the minimum spanning tree. The isolation property is defined as follows. Let c &gt; 0 be a constant and E be a set of edges in d-dimensional space, and let e ∈ E be an edge of length l. If it is possible to place a protecting disk B of radius c • l with center on e and B does not intersect with any other edge, then edge e is said to be isolated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. If all the edges in E are isolated, then E is said to satisfy the isolation property. We define the protecting disk of a segment uv as disk (o, √ 35</p><p>36 uv ), where o is the midpoint of segment uv. Obviously, we need all such disks do not intersect any edge except the one that defines it.</p><p>Theorem 6: The structure LSΘGG is low-weighted.</p><p>Proof. We will prove this by showing that all edges E in LSΘGG satisfy the isolation property. For the sake of contradiction, assume that E does not satisfy the isolation property. Assume there is one edge uv that is not isolated. Thus, there is 36 uv ). First notice that, both x and y can not locate inside disk (o, 1  2 uv ), otherwise the property of Gabriel graph is violated.</p><p>We further divide the hypothetical situation into two cases: Case 1: xy &lt; uv .</p><p>We will show that the link uv itself must have been removed by our algorithm, by proving that both ux and vy are no more than 1  3 uv in the hypothetical situation. To prove this by inducing contradiction, w.l.o.g., we assume that vy &gt; 1  3 uv . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref> (a) illustrates our proof that follows. The link xy intersects the disk (o, 1  2 uv ) with two points x and w, and intersects the right half of disk (v, 1  3 uv ) with the point y . Let t be a point on the top half of disk (v, 1  3 uv ) such that ut = uv . The segment ut intersects the disk (o, 1  2 uv ) with point t . It is easy to verify that ut is the tangent line of protecting disk (o, √ 35 36 uv ). From the assumption vy &gt; 1  3 uv , node y is out of the disk (v, 1  3 uv ). Hence, xy &gt; x y . We continue to induce contradiction that xy &gt; uv by showing x y &gt; ut = uv .</p><p>1. Obviously, x w &gt; ut , because the chord x w of disk (o, 1  2 uv ) is closer the center o than the chord ut (because x w intersects the protecting disk while ut is the tangent line).</p><p>2. Similarly, wy &gt; tt , because ww &gt; 2 tt (this is due to, in disk (v, 1 3 uv ), the chord ww is closer to center v than line tt , and segment tt is half of the chord overlapping tt since vt is perpendicular to ut in disk (o, 1  2 uv ).) and wy &gt; 1  2 ww (due to in disk (v, 1 3 uv ), ∠x wv &gt; ∠uwv = π 2 , hence wy is more than half of the chord ww .).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consequently, xy &gt; x y</head><p>= x w + wy &gt; ut + tt = ut = uv , hence we get the contradiction. In other words, uv should have been deleted if uv &gt; xy and xy intersects the protecting disk of uv. The hypothetical case is fake.  Consequently, xy should have been deleted if uv &lt; xy and xy intersects the protecting disk of uv. The hypothetical case is also fake.</p><p>In summary, each link uv ∈ LSΘGG satisfies the isolation property, that is to say, LSΘGG is low-weighted.
