<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>One important goal in many information retrieval tasks involves providing search results that covers a wide range of topics for a search query, called search result diversi cation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The goal of search result diversi cation can be formalized as selecting a minimal subset of documents from the candidate set to cover as many di erent subtopics as possible. Since the novelty of a document depends on the other selected documents, selecting an optimal subset of documents amounts to the problem subset selection and its complexity is in general NP-hard.</p><p>Typical approaches treat search result diversi cation as ranking the documents based on their relevance as well as the novelty. Greedy sequential document selection has been widely adopted to construct the diverse document ranking, that is, the document ranking is constructed step by step. At each step the ranking model selects one document from the candidate set for the current ranking position. Usually, the document with the maximal amount of additional utility, a.k.a. marginal relevance, is selected.</p><p>A number of diverse ranking algorithms have been developed under the greedy document selection framework. Di erent algorithms utilize di erent criteria to estimate the additional utility a candidate document can provide. For example, the representative approach of maximal marginal relevance (MMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> uses the sum of the query-document relevance and the maximal document distance (referred to as marginal relevance) as the utility. xQuAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> de nes the utility so as to explicitly account for the relationship between documents retrieved for the original query and the possible subqueries. In recent years, machine learning based methods have been proposed for conducting diverse ranking <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. The relational learning to rank (R-LTR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and its variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> de ne the utilities based on the relevance features and the novelty features. MDP-DIV adapted the Markov decision process (MDP) to model the document ranking process. The utility of a document is estimated based on the MDP state, which consists of the query, the preceding documents, and the remaining candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>The greedy sequential document selection simpli es the ranking process and can accelerate the online ranking. However, the rankings produced by greedy document selection are inevitably suboptimal. At each ranking position, the greedy selection mechanism only considers the possibilities at the current ranking position (i.e., estimates the utility of each candidate document if it were selected). Thus, greedy document selection will select the locally optimal document at each ranking position. However, a sequence of the locally optimal documents cannot lead to the globally optimal diverse ranking, because the utilities of the documents are not independent. The selection of a document at one position will change the utilities of the remaining candidate documents and thereafter a ects the subsequent decisions. In general the ranking algorithm need to explore the whole ranking space if the optimal ranking is mandatory. However, this is usually infeasible in real applications because of the huge space size: there exist N ! di erent rankings for N documents.</p><p>Inspired by the success and methodology of the AlphaGo <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and AlphaGo Zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for the Game of Go, in this paper we propose to enhance the MDP model for diverse ranking <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> with the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), for alleviating the suboptimal ranking problem. The new ranking model, referred to as M 2 Div (stands for MCTS enhanced MDP for Diverse ranking), makes use of an MDP to model the sequential document selection process of diverse ranking. At each time step (corresponding to a ranking position), based on the user query and the preceding document ranking, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to produce the policy (a distribution over the candidate documents) for guiding the document selection and the value for estimating the whole document ranking quality (e.g., in terms of Î±-NDCG@M). To alleviate the problem of suboptimal diverse ranking, in stead of greedily selecting a document with the predicted raw policy, M 2 Div conducts an exploratory decision making: an MCTS is conducted to explore the possible document rankings at the subsequent positions, resulting a strengthened search policy for conducting the real document selection at current position. Since it has explored more future possible document rankings, the search policy has higher probability to select a globally optimal document than the predicted raw policy. Moving to the next iteration, the above process is continued until the candidate set is empty.</p><p>Reinforcement learning is used to train the model parameters. In the training phase, at each training iteration and for each training query, an MCTS guided by the current policy function and value function is conducted at each ranking position. The MCTS produces a search policy for the document selection. Then the model parameters are adjusted to minimize the loss function. The loss function consists of two terms: 1) the squared error between the predicted value and the nal quality of the whole document ranking in terms of Î±-NDCG@M; and 2) the cross entropy of the predicted raw policy and the search policy for document selection. Stochastic gradient descent is utilized for conducting the optimization.</p><p>To evaluate the e ectiveness of M 2 Div, we conducted experiments on the basis of TREC benchmark datasets. The experimental results showed that M 2 Div can signi cantly outperform the stateof-the-art diverse ranking approaches that using greedy sequential decision making, including the heuristic based diverse ranking methods of MMR and xQuAD, and the machine learning based diverse ranking methods of PAMM and MDP-DIV. We analyzed the results and showed that the exploratory decision-making mechanism in M 2 Div does help to improve the ranking performances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK 2.1 Search result diversi cation</head><p>It is a common practice to formalize the construction of a diverse ranking list in search as a process of greedy sequential decision making. Existing research focus on designing e ective criteria to estimate the utility a document can provide. Carbonell and Goldstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed the maximal marginal relevance criterion, which is a linear combination of the query-document relevance and the document novelty, to select the document. xQuAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> directly models di erent aspects of a query and estimates the utility as the relevance of the retrieved documents to each identi ed aspects. Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a utility function that explicitly leverages the hierarchical intents of queries and selects the documents that maximize diversity in the hierarchical structure. See also <ref type="bibr">[2, 4, 7, 9-11, 22, 29]</ref> Machine learning techniques have been applied to construct diverse ranking, also adopting the greedy sequential decision making as the basic framework. The key problem becomes how to automatically learn the utility function on the basis of training queries. Some researchers de ne the utility as a linear combination of the handcrafted relevance features and novelty features <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. The novelty term in the utility function can be modeled with the deep learning model of neural tensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Jiang et al. used recurrent neural networks and max-pooling to model subtopic information explicitly with the attention mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Xia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed to model the dynamics of the document utility with MDP and learning the model parameters with policy gradient.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Reinforcement learning for IR</head><p>The reinforcement learning has been widely used in variant IR applications. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a win-win search framework based on partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) is proposed to model session search as a dual-agent stochastic game. In the model, the state of the search users are encoded as a four hidden decision making states. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, the log-based document re-ranking is modeled as a POMDP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> propose to model the process of constructing a document ranking with MDP, for the ranking tasks of search result diversi cation and relevance ranking, respectively. Muti-armed bandit, another type of reinforcement learning model, is also widely applied to rank learning. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposes two online learning bandit algorithms to learn a diverse ranking of documents based on users clicking behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> formalizes the interactively optimizing of information retrieval systems as a dueling bandit problem and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposes cascading bandits to identify K most attractive document for users. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> Reinforcement learning models are also used for building recommender systems. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> designs an MDP-based recommendation model for taking both the long-term e ects of each recommendation and the expected value of each recommendation into account. Lu and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposes POMDP-Rec, a neuraloptimized POMDP algorithm, for building a collaborative ltering recommender system.</p><p>In this paper, we also adopt the reinforcement learning model of MDP to formalize the diverse ranking process in search result diversi cation.</p></div>

At each time step t the agent receives some representation of the environment's state, s t â S, and on that basis selects an action a t â A(s t ). One time step later, in part as a consequence of its action, the agent nds itself in a new state s t +1 = T (s t , a t ). Usually the goal of reinforcement learning is to achieve maximum long term return, that is, to maximize the value V (s 0 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Monte Carlo tree search</head><p>The decisions made by an MDP (e.g., selecting the most con dent actions according to the policy) may get suboptimal results. Theoretically the system has to explore the whole space of decision sequences to get a global optimal result. However, this is usually not feasible. MCTS is a tool to conduct heuristic search inside the whole space, more likely to produce a better decision sequence than that of produced by the greedy decisions.</p><p>Given the time step t, the policy function p, and the state value function V , MCTS aims at searching a strengthened policy for making better decisions. The MCTS consists of four phases: selection, expansion, simulation, and back-propagation:</p><p>Selection: Starting at the root node R, MCTS recursively selects the optimal child nodes until a leaf node L is reached.</p><p>Expansion: If L is not a terminal node (i.e. it does not end the episode) then create one or more child nodes for L (each corresponds a possible action) and select one child node C according to the predicted policy.</p><p>Simulation/Evaluation: MCTS runs a simulation from C until a result is achieved. In the AlphaGo Zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> the simulation is replaced with the value function for accelerating the tree search. That is, the result of simulation is estimated by the value function.</p><p>Back-propagation: Update the statistics stored in the current move sequence with the simulation or estimated result.</p><p>The MCTS outputs a search policy Ï over the actions, which is utilized to choose the action at time step t. The iteration is continued until the whole episode is generated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DIVERSE RANKING WITH POLICY-VALUE NETWORKS</head><p>In this section, we introduce the proposed M 2 Div model, which makes use of MDP and MCTS for modeling the diverse ranking process and for strengthening the policy for selecting documents at each of the MDP iteration, respectively. The agent-environment interaction of M 2 Div is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Each of the MDP time step corresponds to a ranking position. At time step t (t = 0, 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ ), the policy-value network receives the environment state s t and makes use of an LSTM to produce the representation of the state s t . After that, guided by the current policy function p and value function V , an MCTS search is executed. The output of MCTS is a strengthened new search policy Ï . The action a t is then selected according to the strengthened policy Ï , which chooses a document from the candidate set and places it to the ranking position t + 1.</p><p>Moving to the next time step t + 1, the system nds itself in a new state s t +1 and the process is repeated until all of the documents are ranked.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">MDP formulation of diverse ranking</head><p>Suppose we are given a query q, which is associated with a set of retrieved documents</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X = {x 1 , â¢ â¢ â¢ , x M } â X,</formula><p>where both the query q and the documents x i are represented with their preliminary representations, i.e., the vectors learned by the doc2vec model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and X is the set of all possible documents. The goal of diverse ranking is to construct a model that can rank the documents so that the top ranked documents cover a wide range of subtopics of a search query. The construction of a diverse ranking can be considered as a process of sequential decision making with an MDP in which each time step corresponds to a ranking position. The states, actions, transition function, value function, and policy function of the MDP are set as:</p><p>States S: We design the state at time step t as a triple s t = [q, Z t , X t ], where q is the preliminary representation of the user issued query; Z t = {x (n) } t n=1 is the sequence of t preceding documents, where x (n) is the document ranked at position n; X t is the set of candidate documents. At the beginning (t = 0), the state is initialized as s 0 = [q, â, X ], where â is the empty sequence and X contains all of the M retrieved candidate documents.</p><p>Actions A: At each time step t, the A(s t ) is the set of actions the agent can choose, each corresponds to a document from X t . That is, the action a t â A(s t ) at the time step t selects a document x m(a t ) â X t for the ranking position t + 1, where m(a t ) is the index of the document selected by a t .</p><p>Transition T : The transition function T : S Ã A â S is de ned as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s t +1 = T (s t , a t ) = T ([q, Z t , X t ], a t ) = q, Z t â {x m(a t ) }, X t \ {x m(a t ) } ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where â appends x m(a t ) to Z t and \ removes x m(a t ) from X t . At each time step t, based on state s t the system chooses an action a t . Then, the system moves to time step t + 1 and the system transits to a new state s t +1 : rst, the query q is kept unchanged; second, the selected document is appended to the end of Z t , generating a new document sequence; nally, the selected document at step t is removed from the candidate set: X t +1 = X t \ {x m(a t ) }. Thus, the number of actions the agent can choose at t + 1 is reduced by one.</p><p>Value function V : The state value function V : S â R is a scalar evaluation, estimating the quality of the whole document ranking (an episode) based on the input state. The value function is learned so as to approximate a prede ned evaluation measure (e.g., Î±-NDCG@M).</p><p>In this paper, we make use of the long short term memory (LSTM) to summarize the input state s as a real vector, and then de ne the value function as nonlinear transformation of the weighted sum of the LSTM outputs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V (s) = Ï ( w, LSTM(s) + b ) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where w and b are the weight vector and the bias to be learned during training, and Ï (x) = 1 1+e âx is the nonlinear sigmoid function. The deep neural network model LSTM: S â R L maps a state to a real vector where L is the number of dimensions. Given</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">s = [q, Z = {x 1 , x 2 , â¢ â¢ â¢ , x t }, X t ], where x k (k = 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ , t)</formula><p>is the document ranked at k-th position and represented with its doc2vec embedding. LSTM outputs a representation h k for position k as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f k =Ï (W f x k + U f h k â1 + b f ), i k =Ï (W i x k + U i h k â1 + b i ), o k =Ï (W o x k + U o h kâ1 + b o ), c k =f k â¢ c k â1 + i k â¢ tanh(W c x k + U c h k â1 + b c ), h k =o k â¢ tanh(c k ),</formula><p>where h and c are initialized with the query q:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">[h 0 , c 0 ] = [Ï (V h q), Ï (V c q)],</formula><p>operator "â¢" denotes the element-wise product and "Ï " is applied to each of the entries; the variables f k , i k , o k , c k and h k denote the forget gate's activation vector, input gate's activation vector, output gate's activation vector, cell state vector, and output vector of the LSTM block, respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">W f , W i , W o , U f , U i , U o , V h , V c , b f , b i , b o</formula><p>are weight matrices and bias vectors need to be learned during training. The output vector and cell state vector at the t-th cell are concatenated as the output of LSTM:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">LSTM(s) = h t T , c t T T .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Policy function p: The policy p(s) de nes a function that takes the state as input and output a distribution over all of the possible actions a â A(s). Speci cally, each probability in the distribution is a normalized soft-max function whose input is the bilinear product of the LSTM de ned in Equation (3) and the selected document:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p(a|s) = exp x T m(a) U p LSTM(s) a âA(s) exp x T m(a ) U p LSTM(s)</formula><p>, where U p is the parameter in the bilinear product. Thus, the policy function p(s) is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p(s) = p(a 1 |s), â¢ â¢ â¢ , p(a | A(s) | |s) .<label>(4)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Strengthening policy with MCTS</head><p>Selecting documents greedily with the predicted raw policy p in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">4</ref>) may lead to suboptimal rankings because the policy only summarizes the historical information and has no idea on how the action a t will in uent the future decisions. Let's use an example to show the limitation of greedy selection. Suppose that the query q has 6 subtopics, and the 3 retrieved candidate documents d 1 , d 2 , and d 3 cover the subtopics of {1, 2, 3, 6}, {1, 2, 5}, and {1, 2, 6}, respectively. The greedy selection with raw policy prefers d 1 for the rst position, as it covers the most number of subtopics. Thus, the document ranking constructed with the greedy policy could be [d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ] and S-recall@2 = 5  6 . However, if the ranking algorithm could explore (part of) the whole ranking space, it will found a better document ranking in terms of S-recall@2: [d 2 , d 3 , d 1 ] with S-recall@2 = 1. The example clearly indicate that greedy selection could lead to suboptimal rankings.</p><p>To alleviate the issue, following the practices in AlphaGo <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and AlphaGo Zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we propose to conduct lookahead searches in the ranking space with MCTS. Speci cally, at each ranking position t, an MCTS search is executed, guided by the current policy function p and value function V , and output a strengthened new search policy Ï . It is believed that the search policy Ï will select a much better action (document) for the ranking position than that of selected by the raw policy p in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">4</ref>). This is because the lookahead MCTS tries to explore the whole ranking space and can partially alleviate the suboptimal ranking problem.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> illustrates the MCTS process and Algorithm 1 shows the details. Each node of the tree corresponds to an MDP state. The tree search algorithm takes a root node s R , number of search times K, value function V , policy function p, human labels , and the evaluation measure R as inputs. Note that and R are only used at the training time. The algorithm iterate K times and outputs a strengthened search policy Ï for selecting a document for root node s R .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Di erence with AlphaGo Zero</head><p>M 2 Div is inspired by the AlphaGo Zero program. It enjoys a number of merits from AlphaGo Zero, including the shared neural network for estimating policies and values, lookahead MCTS for strengthening the raw policy, and the compounded loss that simultaneously optimizes the value function and the policy function etc. However, M 2 Div has made a number of fundamental modi cations for search result diversi cation.</p><p>First, the formalizations of the tasks are di erent. AlphaGo Zero formalizes the playing of Go as an alternating Markov game where each action corresponds a move, the states are the raw board positions, the value function approximates the probability of winning, and the next state depends not only on the chosen action but also on the move by the opponent. M 2 Div, on the other hand, formalizes the ranking of documents as planning with an MDP where each action corresponds to a document selection. The MDP states consists of the query, the preceding document ranking, and the remaining candidates. The value function approximates a diverse ranking evaluation measure (e.g., Î±-NDCG@M). The state transition is fully determined by the current state and the chosen action.</p><p>Second, the supervision signals for learning the model parameters are di erent. AlphaGo Zero uses the results of self-play (-1 for loss, 0 for draw, and 1 for win) as the supervision signals and the value function is tted to the results. The task of diverse ranking, however, is not a Markov game. It is di cult (also unnecessary) to execute the self-play. In the training phase, M 2 Div resorts to the human labels and the prede ned evaluation measure to generate supervision information. Speci cally, the Î±-NDCG@M of each generated episode is calculated and used as the ground-truth to t the value function (the rst part of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">8</ref>)). In this way, M 2 Div drives the training process so as to directly optimize the evaluation measure of Î±-NDCG@M. Note that Î±-NDCG@M can be replaced with any other diverse ranking evaluation measures.</p><p>Third, the shared deep neural networks for calculating the policies and values are di erent. AlphaGo Zero makes use of a residual network which takes the raw board position as its inputs and outputs the a probability distribution over moves, and a probability of the current player winning in position. The raw boards can be considered as some xed sized images. In M 2 Div, the MDP states consist of the queries and sequences of documents etc. Residual network cannot handle the state data as the queries/documents are raw texts, and the lengths of the document sequences vary in di erent time steps. To address the issue, M 2 Div rst represents the query and document sequence as the state vector of an LSTM (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">3</ref>). The policy and the value are then calculated on the basis of the representations outputted by the LSTM.</p></div>

In the training phrase, the MCTS also was set to control the maximal length of the search depth less than 5. That is, the condition at line 9 of Algorithm 1 is true if the length of the tree depth is less than 5 and the candidate set is not empty. In all of the experiments, the learning rate Î·, the number of search times K, the tree search trade-o parameter Î», and the number of LSTM hidden units h were tuned based on the validation set and set to Î· = 0.01, K = 5000, Î» = 3.0, and h = 5.</p><p>In online ranking phase, M 2 Div has two versions: selecting the documents with the raw policy p or with the MCTS strengthened policy Ï .

We also conducted experiments to show the e ectiveness of the MCTS in o ine training. Speci cally, at the end of each training iteration, based on current ranking model, we tested the performances of the document ranking constructed with the raw policy p and with the MCTS search policy Ï , in term of Î±-NDCG@5 on the training queries. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the averaged Î±-NDCG@5 scores among all of the training queries at each training iterations. It is not surprise that the document rankings generated by the search policy Ï are superior to that of generated by the raw policy p, at all of the training iterations. The results indicate that the lookahead MCTS can generate better diverse document rankings for training the model parameters, at all of the training iterations. The results also partially explained why "M 2 Div(without MCTS)", which did not conduct MCTS at the online time, can still outperform the baselines. The MCTS conducted at the training time produced better diverse document rankings for training the model parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Ranking with policy or with value?</head><p>In "M 2 Div(without MCTS)", we rely on the raw policy p for ranking the documents. In principle, the value function V can also be used for ranking, that is, at each state s a document (action) Ã¢ is selected if Ã¢ = arg max a âA(s) V (T (s, a)). We conducted experiments to show the performances of these two approaches and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows the test performance curves of the document rankings with the policy function and with the value function. From the results, we can see that the document rankings generated by the raw policy p are more stable and better than that of generated by the value function V . One possible reason for the phenomenon is that the ranking performance measure Î±-NDCG@5 are not easy to estimate accurately, especially at the early stages of the ranking procedure. This is why p in stead of V is adopted in "M 2 Div(without MCTS)".  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we have proposed a novel approach to learning diverse ranking model for search result diversi cation, referred to as M 2 Div. In contrast to existing methods that greedily select a locally optimal document at each of the ranking positions, M 2 Div conducts an exploratory decision making with the lookahead MCTS and thus can select a better document. MDP is used to model the ranking process and reinforcement learning is utilized to train the model parameters. M 2 Div o ers several advantages: ranking with both the shared policy function and the value function, high accuracy in ranking, and exibility of trading-o between accuracy and online ranking speed. Experimental results based on the TREC benchmark datasets show that M 2 Div can signi cantly outperform the state-ofthe-art baselines including the heuristic methods of MMR, xQuAD and learning methods of R-LTR, PAMM, and MDP-DIV.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: The MCTS process for calculating the strengthened search policy Ï .</figDesc></figure>
