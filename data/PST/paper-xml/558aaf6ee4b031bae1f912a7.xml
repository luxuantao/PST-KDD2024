<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE modification of images in a way that is nondetectable for an observer who does not know the original image is called retouching or inpainting. Mainly, three groups of works can be found in the literature related to digital inpainting. The first one deals with the restoration of films <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the second one is related to texture synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and the third one is related to what we would call geometric inpainting. This article proposes a method to perform geometric inpainting, so let us comment on this latter category. For an extensive survey on geometric inpainting, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>A pioneering contribution in the recovery of plane image geometry is due to Mumford et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, where the authors proposed an energy functional to segment a scene which took into account the depth of the objects in the scene and the energy of the occluded boundaries between junctions. They assumed that the completion curves should be as short as possible and should respect the principle of good continuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>: This principle is that contours based on smooth continuity are preferred to abrupt changes of direction. Inspired by the Elastica functional, Masnou and Morel <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a variational formulation for the recovery of the missing parts of a gray level two-dimensional image and they referred to this interpolation process as dis-occlusion, since the missing parts can be considered as occlusions hiding the part of the image we  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to propose an edge propagation partial differential equation (PDE) for the image inpainting formulation. Replicating basic art conservators techniques, a third-order PDE propagates the level lines arriving at the missing region, and the completion tends to respect the principle of good continuation. Bertalmío et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> showed the connection of this equation with Navier-Stokes equations, as well as a parallel among image processing and fluid dynamics quantities. On the other hand, Ballester, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> introduced a relaxation of the Elastica functional which then can be minimized with a system of coupled PDEs: This is the first variational approach to the inpainting problem that complies with the principle of good continuation and is topologically independent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Our Contribution</head><p>The geometric inpainting methods just mentioned present some shortcomings that we intend to overcome. The dis-occlusion algorithm of Masnou <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> may connect boundary points with straight lines, thus not complying with the principle of good continuation. The image inpainting algorithm of Bertalmío et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is not contrast invariant, as it was pointed out by Chan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Chan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> propose a third-order contrast-invariant PDE for inpainting, with two competing terms in two orthogonal directions. The weights for these terms must be set manually, and they affect the good continuation of level lines. The variational filling-in of Ballester et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is not contrast invariant either, although contrast invariance is imposed in the implementation by decomposing each gray-level image into 256 binary images, one per level set, processing these binary images separately, and finally compositing these 256 results. Also from the standpoint of mathematical formality, these algorithms lack in some respects. Dis-occlusion and variational filling-in come from approximations or relaxations of the Elastica functional, required since the functional is not lower semi-continuous, while the image inpainting equation intends to replicate the manual procedures of art conservators and its mathematical formality is an open question.</p><p>Our contribution in this article is the following. We reformulate the inpainting problem as a particular case of image interpolation in which we intend to propagate level lines. Expressing this in terms of local neighborhoods and using a Taylor expansion we derive a third-order PDE that performs inpainting. This PDE is optimal in the sense that it is the most accurate third-order PDE which can ensure good continuation of level lines. The continuation is strong, allowing to restore thin structures occluded by a wide gap. The result is also contrast invariant. This is a novel PDE, which both in its accuracy and contrast invariance outperforms the approaches cited above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROPOSED APPROACH</head><p>An image is usually modeled as a function defined in a bounded domain with values in ( for gray level images or for color images). For simplicity, we shall consider only the case of gray level images. The inpainting problem can be formulated generically in the following way. Given a subset of the image domain in which the values for are not defined (the image gap that we wish to inpaint), we must determine values for inside which match the boundary conditions at .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Inpainting As Interpolation</head><p>Inspired by the remarkable work by Caselles et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, we will begin by reformulating the inpainting problem as a case of interpolation. Assume that the gap contains only one pixel . There are many possible criteria to choose the value to fill the gap, let us recall from the introduction to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> one of the simplest ones: Select as the average of its level-line neighbors. Then <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with the (counter-clockwise) 90 rotation of , the gradient of (and, therefore, the level-line direction). Expanding in a Taylor series <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where we have omitted the pixel coordinate of ; for simplicity, we have omitted the term for because it is identically zero:</p><p>, and we have used the notation Truncating this series and comparing with (1), we obtain the following interpolation equation:</p><p>(5)</p><p>A very important observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where is the Euclidean curvature of the level line of at the pixel location . Therefore, this type of interpolation may be achieved as the steady state of the second-order PDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> an equation which is closely related to total variation minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and Perona and Malik's anisotropic diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. One may use this equation to perform inpainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, but since the steady state is , all the interpolated level lines will have zero curvature, and, therefore, they will be straight lines. This is an important limitation, stemming from the fact that ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is a second-order PDE. It has been proven that, in order to match not only gray values, but also level line angles at the boundary , we need a PDE of at least third order <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In order to find an interpolation procedure that yields a thirdorder PDE, we propose the following criteria, extending the ideas presented above: Select as the average of its levelline neighbors. That is, now we are interpolating the gradient along the level lines, instead of the gray level. Since interpolation of gray levels yielded a second-order PDE, we expect that interpolation of the gradient yields a third-order PDE. This criteria may be formulated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> which implies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> The expansion for is <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Expanding , letting , truncating the series and averaging, we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Substituting ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) into (11), we get <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Equation ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) is a novel PDE that we introduce in this paper to perform contrast-invariant inpainting. It is also the third-order PDE that best approximates the principle of good continuation. We will comment on these aspects next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Properties of Our Proposed Equation</head><p>We started our derivation by imposing continuity of the gradient, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Therefore, the solution to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> will have continuous , in particular, across the gap boundary (continuity along each level line). This implies that , the direction of the level line, will also be continuous, i.e., the interpolated level lines will bend smoothly and not have any kinks. In other words, our proposed equation satisfies the principle of good continuation, as intended. Let us now show why this equation is the third-order PDE that best satisfies this principle.</p><p>Let us now pose the inpainting problem as a case of interpolation in which we want to propagate inside the level lines arriving at but keeping the direction of the lines. We may require constancy of the level lines direction in the following way: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Letting</head><p>, expanding in a Taylor series and truncating after the fourth-order term, we get the same third-order equation as before <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> The left-hand side is the term of the expansion corresponding to , the first term that is not identically zero (since the term for is identically zero, and the terms for even powers and cancel out when subtracting). Any third-order PDE other than <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> will not cancel this first term of the expansion of ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>). Therefore, any other third-order PDE will approximate (13) with a higher error than <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. It is in this sense that we say that our proposed PDE is optimal.</p><p>It may be a bit surprising to arrive at the same equation by a seemingly different path, but, in fact, ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) both imply that the direction of each level line should be continuous along that level line (i.e., that as a curve, the level line should have no singularities).</p><p>Another very interesting property is the following:</p><p>This implies that solving our <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> amounts to propagating the quantity along the level lines of the image. So our equation is quite similar to the image inpainting equation , where the quantity propagated along the level lines was the Laplacian, (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). In practice, we solve ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) by finding the steady state solution of ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) Equation ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is also contrast invariant: If for an initial image , we obtain a solution , then for a contrast modified initial image , we obtain the solution , for any nondecreasing function. This is an important property for any geometric inpainting algorithm, since it guarantees that the inpainting result depends only on the geometry of the initial image and not on its particular contrast. We refer the reader to the appendix for this proof. Equation ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is not invariant to inversion of contrast, though; for this, we would need to add a new term, which is also discussed in Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Numerical Implementation</head><p>We have implemented ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) using an explicit, forward time, finite differences scheme with the monotonized central difference slope limiter of Van Leer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Experimentally, we found that the explicit, forward time, upwind finite differences scheme of Osher and Sethian <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> was too diffusive for this equation. We did not achieve good results with the Mc Cormack scheme, either <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>For the sake of clarity, let us rewrite ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Now, we multiply and divide the right-hand side by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> We use central differences for the computation of all derivatives in and the dividing term . But for the multiplying term , we use the aforementioned slope limiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where the sub-subindexes C, B, and F denote central, backward and forward differences respectively and the minmod function satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> We apply a nonlinear scaling of to increase the speed of convergence Also, we add some anisotropic diffusion to prevent instabilities (which appear as wild oscillations) where the weight is 0.01. These are the same techniques used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Unfortunately, we do not know clearly how these numerical tricks modify the properties of our solutions. In particular, if , we can no longer claim that our solution satisfies 14. We must choose the minimal that guarantees stability so that the distortion introduced is also small, as it can be observed in the examples in Section II-D. In our experiments, we have found that the adding of some diffusion is absolutely necessary, at least with the numerical schemes that we have implemented. We are carrying out further research in the numerical implementation for our equation.</p><p>All the images take values in the range 0 to 255. The time step is 0.1 and convergence is achieved in a few thousand iterations, depending on the size of . To speed convergence, it is convenient to initialize the process with a few steps of Gaussian filtering or, for bigger , to use a multiresolution approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Examples</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the image to inpaint (left), and the results obtained with total variation (TV) (middle left), image inpainting (middle right), and our equation (right). Notice how with TV the solution is a straight line (zero curvature) so there is no continuation at the boundary. As we mentioned, this is what to expect when we use second-order PDEs. With image inpainting there is good continuation but also bending of the line. With our equation, the edge is strongly propagated inward and we are able to reconstruct a corner inside . To have an idea of the scale: The long side of the black trapezoid is 120 pixels long. Notice also that the result is not so good on the left-hand side: This is due to the numerical scheme and our choice of orthogonal gradient (counter-clockwise), which, in this figure, makes information flow into the gap at the top right, and flow out at the bottom.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows clearly the strength of the continuation achieved by our equation. With image inpainting (middle) structures that are thinner than the width of the gap will tend to not be connected, as it is the case here. The same situation arises with the variational approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. With our equation, the black bar is connected although its width is 30 pixels and the height of the occluding rectangle is 90 pixels.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, the result is close to what one would expect, although the white squares end up not touching each other. We hope to overcome this limitation with a better numerical scheme. Both this figure and the previous one have been binarized (thresholded at the middle gray value).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the result of using our equation for the restoration of the component in a decomposition of the image <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. For the component, we have used the texture synthesis algorithm of Efros and Leung <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In some parts, the restoration is quite good, while in others, there is noticeable blur stemming from the inpainting of . Texture synthesis techniques like <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> do not cause blurring, but, on the other hand, they do not deal well with curved boundaries, as mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Notice also that, for our algorithm, topology is not an issue (the gap has a hole). Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the result for a color image, where we have applied our equation to each channel separately, using a YCrCb color model. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Notice in the details (bottom row) how several thin structures are preserved, like the zippers in the orange uniform. Also, the boundaries are sharp, and there are no spurious colors in the restoration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have introduced a third-order PDE to perform geometric inpainting on images. This PDE is optimal in the sense that it is the most accurate third-order PDE which can ensure continuation of level lines. It is also contrast invariant. With this equation, the edges are propagated inside the gap with minimum bending, allowing for the connection of thin structures occluded by a wide gap, and also the formation of corners. This is a novel PDE, which both in its accuracy and contrast invariance outperforms previous related approaches in the area. We are currently studying the mathematical properties of this equation regarding existence and uniqueness of solutions and its numerical implementation. APPENDIX Let be a nondecreasing function. This is the contrast-modifying function that we apply to our image . Therefore, the partial derivatives take this form <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> (for the remaining derivatives simply exchange the and subindexes). Substituting and its derivatives for and its derivatives into <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> and removing the terms that cancel out (those involving and ) yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> Since is nondecreasing, and both ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) are the same. Therefore, our proposed PDE ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is contrast invariant.</p><p>Notice that this is not the case if there is an inversion of contrast, so if then . To overcome this and make the equation also invariant to inversion of contrast, we have to multiply by a term that changes its sign when there is an inversion of contrast, and that does not alter the steady state of the equation. An example of such a term is the sign of the Euclidean curvature:</p><p>, so our equation would be (24)</p><p>which can be rewritten as (25)</p><p>Unfortunately, we have not obtained good experimental results with our numerical implementation of (24), so all the experiments presented in this paper use <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Abstract-PDE-based image inpainting has become a very active area of research after the pioneering works of Masnou and Morel, Bertalmío et al., and Ballester et al.
