<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Demand side management encourages the users in a smart grid to shift their electricity consumption in response to varying electricity prices. In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for the demand response based on cost minimization. Each user in the system will find an optimal start time and operating mode for the appliances in response to the varying electricity prices. We model the cost function for each user and the constraints for the appliances. We then propose an approximate greedy iterative algorithm that can be employed by each user to schedule appliances. In the proposed algorithm, each user requires only the knowledge of the price of the electricity, which depends on the aggregated load of other users, instead of the load profiles of individual users. In order for the users to coordinate with each other, we introduce a penalty term in the cost function, which penalizes large changes in the scheduling between successive iterations. Numerical simulations show that our optimization method will result in lower cost for the consumers, lower generation costs for the utility companies, lower peak load, and lower load fluctuations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>fashion) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The consumers will then adjust their load schedule according to the price. Further, the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> has made it possible to collect the usage data and to communicate with other AMI devices. With this data, the users can schedule the consumption of electricity using the energy-management controller (EMC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A programmable logic controller (PLC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is then used which helps implement the proposed demand response algorithm and provides an interface between the appliances, sensors, and the controller. In addition, PLCs also provide modules to process signals that have special interfacing requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Several companies developed commercial PLC based home energy management systems recently, see for example the products in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The smart grid research community has been actively studying the various demand response problems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the authors study the energy scheduling problem under the assumption of known energy consumption for all the appliances; in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the authors study energy scheduling under the assumption of known operating times for all the appliances. Both works consider a single user scenario in order to find the optimal energy consumption. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the authors find the optimal start times of the appliances in a system with multiple users, under the assumption of a known energy consumption for all the appliances. With this approach, there is a shift of peak load, but the peak load itself is not significantly reduced. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the authors solve a similar problem in a distributed framework using a stochastic algorithm. They assume that each appliance has a flexible start time, but a fixed duration and energy consumption. In contrast, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> propose an energy scheduling scheme where the start time and the end time are known a priori, and the energy consumption is varied continuously. They propose a distributed algorithm to find the optimal energy consumption schedule using tools from game theory. In this approach, the users are billed based on their total daily use of electricity, the distributed optimization is sequential, all users have to broadcast their schedules to all the other users in the system, and all the appliances are assumed to belong to the same class. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the authors propose an energy consumption scheme by categorizing the appliances into two classes, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the authors propose a scheme with four classes. The appliances are characterized using a utility function and a set of constraints. However, the operating times of the appliances are assumed to be known a priori, and that the energy consumption can be varied continuously.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a distributed energy scheduling algorithm as a demand response for the smart grid. We use day-ahead pricing scheme, where the price of the electricity for the day is determined on the previous day. We then find optimal operating times for the electric appliances and their corresponding energy consumptions by minimizing the overall cost of operation. Our approach is different from the related work in four main aspects: i) we jointly optimize both the start time and the energy consumption for each appliance of the user; ii) we bill all the users based on their time-dependent use of electricity; iii) we enforce realistic constraints on the operation of the appliances by categorizing them into two different classes; iv) we let the energy consumption vary in a discrete manner, which is more realistic.</p><p>Further, our algorithm is fully distributed, where the only information available to the users is the prices for different time-periods. Using this price, each user will find his energy consumption schedule. Since we allow the energy consumption to vary in a discrete fashion, the corresponding optimization problem will be NP-hard. Therefore, we employ a greedy iterative algorithm to find the sub-optimal energy consumption schedule of each user. In each iteration, all the users will communicate their energy consumption schedule to the utility company. The utility company will then adjust the price depending on the overall system load and broadcast the price to all the users. The users will then update their energy consumption based on the new price. These iterations continue until convergence. We use numerical simulations to show that the proposed algorithm will result in lower cost for the consumers, higher profit for the utility companies, lower peak load, and lower load variance.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we introduce the system model, where we describe the model for the users, model for the appliances, and the pricing strategy. We also formulate the problem of appliance scheduling as a centralized optimization problem. In Section III, we propose a distributed framework to solve the optimization problem, where each user employs a greedy approach. We provide numerical simulations in Section IV, and conclude the paper in Section V.</p><p>Notations:We use the following notation in the paper. We denote vectors by boldface lowercase letters, e.g., , and matrices by boldface uppercase letters, e.g., . For a matrix , we use to represent the column of , and use to represent the element in the row and the column.</p><p>, and denote the transpose, conjugate transpose, and vector form of the matrix , respectively.

SYSTEM MODEL We consider a power system with one utility company (we refer to the utility company as "the utility" from now on) and users. For each user, an AMI measures the hourly consumption of electricity and communicates this consumption information to the utility. The AMI also communicates the price information from the utility to the users. A PLC is used to send the control signals for each appliance depending on the demand response algorithm and for each user, an EMC facilitates the communication between the appliances and the PLC and schedules the the appliances within a home. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the flow of the information and power between various blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Model of Users</head><p>We divide a day into time periods, denoted as and consider that there is a set of different appliances, denoted as</p><p>. Each user has a multiset <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>of the appliances chosen from the set , and . In order to simplify the notation for the subsequent discussion, we assume from now that <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . Each appliance contributes to either a base load or a schedulable load. The base load corresponds to electricity needed to satisfy basic user needs. Tasks such as basic refrigeration, heating and lighting correspond to base load. The schedulable load corresponds to appliances with flexible start time, and flexible mode of operation. Appliances such as dishwasher, washer-dryers, PHEVs, etc., contribute to the schedulable load.</p><p>The total load of the user at time , is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1)</formula><p>where is the base load, is the schedulable load, and correspond to the set of base load appliances and schedulable load appliances, respectively. In general, the energy consumption vector of the schedulable appliance of the user, , is a bounded continuous variable. However, in practical scenarios, it is not possible to change the energy consumption of an appliance in a continuous fashion. Therefore, we consider a more realistic model, where each appliance can operate in one of the several possible modes. Each mode corresponds to a particular energy consumption, and the appliances can switch from one mode to the other. Thus, in this model, the energy consumption vector takes only a finite set of values. Let the appliance, for , have operating modes denoted as . For the appliance, we define a energy consumption vector, which specifies the energy consumed by the appliance in each mode, as Again, to simplify the notation for the subsequent discussion, we assume that all the appliances have a same number of operating modes, i.e, . The optimization framework presented below can easily be extended to the case where different appliances have different modes <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . Thus <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> The schedulable load profile matrix of the user is obtained by concatenating the vectors , for , i.e., . Note that the dimension of is . For the schedulable appliance of the user, we also define a binary matrix of size , such that if and only if the appliance is scheduled to operate in mode at time otherwise.</p><p>(3) Given this choice, the load vector, , can be expressed as a function of the using (4)</p><p>The user has the flexibility to choose the operating mode and time of the appliances. We wish to find an optimal for and for that minimizes the total cost to the users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Energy Price</head><p>In this paper, we set the time-dependent unit retail price of electricity to be proportional to the first order derivative of the time-dependent generation cost, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where is the price of electricity at time in cents; , which is a function of , is the generation cost to the utility; is the total generation of the utility at time ; and is a preset profit coefficient. This choice ensures that the load vectors of all the users and the price will be in an equilibrium (see Section III for a detailed description).</p><p>We assume that the load balance constraint is satisfied, and hence the total generation is given as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> We model the generation cost to be a non-decreasing convex quadratic function of the the total generation, :</p><p>where and are constants. Such quadratic models are also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Model of Appliances</head><p>In this section, we describe the models of the schedulable electric appliances that are commonly used in the households. Our modeling of electric appliances was motivated by the smart appliance catalog in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and smart appliances survey report in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Following these references, we broadly separate the electric appliances into two types, where each type is characterized by a set of constraints on the scheduling vector . 1) Type I: If any appliance belonging to the first type is switched ON at time , it has to remain ON until the task is finished. This constraint is usually called the "hold-time" constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In this paper we enforce the hold-time constraint using the following equation: (8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> with representing a column vector of zeros of appropriate dimension. The matrix multiplication results in a binary column vector with the non-zero locations representing the times when the appliance is operating in one of the modes. By pre-multiplying this vector with the shift operator matrix we move up the original column vector by one location. The difference between this vector, and the original column vector should have exactly 2 non-zero elements if the schedule matrix has continual operating times. Equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) represents this argument.</p><p>In addition to the hold-time constraint, all the appliances that belong to type I must finish their respective tasks before the end of the day. Thus, the cumulative energy consumption of the appliance must exceed a minimum energy threshold before the end of the day. In most of the practical scenarios, this minimum energy is proportional to the time of operation of the appliance. Hence, we choose the minimum energy threshold to be , where is a constant that depends on the appliance type and the user, counts the number of time intervals in which the appliance is operating, and is a proportionality constant. With this choice the minimum energy constraint is mathematically expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Appliances such as washer-dryer, dishwasher, etc. belong to this type.</p><p>2) Type II: Appliances that fall into the second type do not follow the hold-time constraint. For these appliances, the times during which the device is turned ON need not be continual. However, the devices should finish the task before a specified end time, which can be expressed mathematically as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where is the specified end time of the appliance of the user, and is a matrix formed by taking the first rows of . Appliances such as PHEV, electric chargers, and power inverters fall under this type.</p><p>In addition, both type I and type II appliances should operate in exactly one mode at any given time. This constraint is enforced using:</p><p>(12)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Optimization Problem</head><p>In this section, we formulate the problem of appliance scheduling as an optimization problem. In addition to considering the total bill that users pay for their energy consumption, we also consider the user preference in terms of their ideal start times and ideal operating modes in the optimization objective. Given complete knowledge about user preferences, we find the optimal scheduling by minimizing the global cost function: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> In the above optimization problem, denotes the cost incurred by the appliance of the user for using it in the mode at time . The cost for each user comprises three parts, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> The first part of the cost is the actual dollar amount the user pays to the utility for using the electricity. This cost for the appliance of the user is given as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> Note that the cost matrix depends on the price vector , and hence on scheduling variables of all the users and all the appliances through (1), ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><p>The choice of the user in selecting the operating mode and operating time for each appliance will result in satisfaction costs which forms the second and the third part of the overall cost, respectively. The user satisfaction costs corresponding to changing the operating mode and the operating time should satisfy the following properties:</p><p>1) The user satisfaction due to the change in the operating mode and time of an appliances should enforce a high cost when the actual mode and time of operation are different from the user preferred operation mode and cost.</p><p>2) The satisfaction due to the change in the operating mode and time should be asymmetric around the ideal operating time and the mode, respectively. This asymmetry models the fact that the satisfaction the user obtains if his appliance is scheduled to operate one mode higher is not the same as the dissatisfaction incurred if the same appliance is scheduled to operate mode lower, and in the same manner models the fact that the satisfaction when an appliance is advanced by certain time is not the same as the dissatisfaction when the same appliance is delayed by the same time. In this paper, we quantify the satisfaction cost of the users due to operating mode mismatch using an exponential cost: <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where is the ideal operating mode of the appliance of the user, and are constants specifying the how quickly the user gets dissatisfied as he moves away from the ideal mode. Note that the cost is asymmetric around the ideal operating mode. The reason for choosing the exponential cost is to satisfy the first property above that imposes high cost when the operating mode deviates from the ideal mode. Since the number of modes is in general small, using an exponential function imposes high cost.</p><p>The third part of the overall cost is the satisfaction cost due to delaying or advancing the operation of an appliance, and we quantify this satisfaction using <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where is the ideal start time of the appliance of the user, and are constants specifying how quickly the user gets dissatisfied by advancing or delaying the operation of the appliance. Similar to , we consider exponential cost, and model it to be asymmetric around the ideal operating time. In general, the cost can be replaced by a weighted combination of the individual costs when the preference of the users for these various costs is different, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> where and are the weights assigned to the cost functions for each user, such that . For example, for the users who are more sensitive to the money they pay to the utility, is greater than or . Solving the centralized optimization problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> requires detailed information about user specifications and preferences, which is difficult to achieve in practice. Further the problem is non-convex since the cost term depends on scheduling matrices of all the users. In the next subsection, we propose a greedy distributed algorithm to find a sub-optimal solution to (13).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DISTRIBUTED OPTIMIZATION FOR LOAD SCHEDULING</head><p>In this section, we propose our distributed framework to solve the optimization problem described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. The idea of the distributed optimization is to allow users to individually minimize their own costs, which in turn reduces the global cost of the system and maximizes the social welfare. The strategy that the utility company uses is to set the prices of the electricity that will force the users to choose the load schedules which will minimize their individual cost as well as the overall global cost. In this manner, the price is used as an invisible hand to coordinate the interaction between the users and the utility.</p><p>Our approach for a distributed framework is inspired by the Walrasian equilibrium theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. A Walrasian equilibrium is defined as the tuple of the price and the user load profile matrices such that at price minimizes both the user cost and the utility cost defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, under the load balance constraint given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><p>The key result of the Walrasian equilibrium theory is the fundamental first welfare theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> stated below: First Fundemental Welfare Theorem: If the tuple of the price and the user load profile matrices form a Walrasian equilibrium, then the load profile matrices are Pareto-optimal.</p><p>The implication of the welfare theorem is that when the users independently update their schedules such that are at an equilibrium, then none of the users will have any incentive to deviate from their respective schedules. Following Theorem 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, it can be seen that at the equilibrium, the price vector takes the form: <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> which is same as our pricing model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, which justifies our choice of the pricing model. Hence when the users independently minimizes their own cost by selecting the price to be proportional marginal generation cost <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , the corresponding tuples will be in an equilibrium, and hence minimize the cost to the utility company.</p><p>This result motivates our distributed algorithm where the utility company and the customers jointly compute an equilibrium in an iterative manner. The user load profiles are all initialized according to their ideal start times and operating modes. Then, at the iteration: • The utility company sets the prices to be the marginal costs using ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), and broadcasts the price. • The user solves local optimization problems corresponding to all schedulable appliances , for , in response to the prices. The optimal scheduling matrix for the appliance of the user is obtained by solving: <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> Note that the cost is fixed and known to each user, since the price has been announced by the utility company.</p><p>• The user transmits his updated load profile to the utility. These iterations continue until convergence, and stop when the change of user load schedule in consecutive iterations is within a (small) preset threshold. The proposed algorithm is implemented at beginning of each day. The beginning of the day can be arbitrary. In this paper, we chose to be the beginning of the day. In this manner the price acts as an invisible hand to decouple the central optimization problem into several optimization problems. These optimization problems that correspond to different users can be solved in a parallel and a distributed manner.</p><p>In to coordinate the behavior among multiple users and to ensure that above algorithm converges, we modify the cost by imposing an additional penalty term. The use of such a penalty term was first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for tensor field estimation, and later used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> for demand response in smart grids with distributed generators. In both papers, the penalty term was the difference between successive iterates of the variable of interest. Motivated by these ideas, we introduce a penalty on a change of load schedule between two consecutive iterations for each user. However, since we are optimizing over binary matrices, the difference in the successive iterates of these matrices does not necessarily imply small changes in the load schedules between iterations. To alleviate this issue, we modify the cost at the iteration by adding an addition term:</p><p>where is a penalty coefficient, and</p><p>with and are defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> Intuitively, the purpose of the penalty term is to penalize the large changes in the scheduling matrix between successive iterations. The selection of the penalty term determines the convergence of the algorithm. In this paper, we chose the penalty term to satisfy two requirements. First, we require significant changes in the user schedules in the beginning of the algorithm, but we want these changes to become smaller with iterations. Therefore we require penalty term be small in the beginning but increase with the iterations, and hence we chose the penalty coefficient to be proportional to the iteration index. Second, we want users with high cost to make large changes in their schedules, and users with small cost to make small changes. This is because users with high cost have a higher impact on the price and hence they should be allowed to schedule their usage without significant constraints. Thus, we choose the penalty coefficient to be inversely proportional to the cost of the users. We choose the penalty coefficient to be <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> Note that large strictly limits the step size, which slows down the convergence and small would not guarantee the convergence of the distributed optimization.</p><p>Each user solves constrained local optimization problems defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> using the greedy algorithm described in the next subsection. After the users solve their respective optimization problems and find their scheduling matrices for all appliances, they compute the total load and report it to the utility. Thus, each user only reports his load profile to the utility instead of broadcasting it to all other users. Further, in order to find the scheduling matrices, each user needs only the price from the utility. In this manner each user only communicates with the utility and no other user in the network, which provides a greater user privacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Greedy Algorithm</head><p>Solving the individual user optimization ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>) is NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and to obtain an approximate solution, we employ a greedy programming approach. Each user finds the scheduling matrix by selecting the best time and mode to operate his appliances. For each user, let denote a cost density, defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> If is a type I device, the user chooses a pair that minimizes , sets , and marks the time as operating time. Then, for all the subsequent steps the user selects a time slot and a mode that minimize with an additional constraint that the chosen time should be adjacent to one of the operating times (already chosen). This process repeats until the total operating energy the the appliance is above the minimum operating energy. Note that if the cost densities are convex, then the above algorithm results in an optimal solution. For the scheduling problem in the paper, the cost densities are not convex, and hence the resulting solution is suboptimal. For a type II device, the user selects a time and a mode corresponding to the minimum value of , sets , and repeats this procedure in the subsequent steps until the minimum energy criterion is satisfied. Note that for the subsequent steps, there is no additional constraint that the selected time should be adjacent to the operating times. The cost corresponding to the solution obtained in this manner is then compared with the cost corresponding to a solution (if exists) in which the device operating at only one time (slot) satisfies the minimum energy constraint. Of these two solutions, we pick the one with the minimum cost. We remark here that for the type II appliances, the problem of energy scheduling is similar to the minimum knapsack problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and our proposed greedy algorithm is sim- ilar to the greedy solution proposed to the minimum knapsack problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. It was shown that cost obtained using this algorithm is at most twice as the optimal cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> (worst-case performance bound). The algorithm is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. Note that contains the set of ordered pairs of operating times and modes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. General Setup</head><p>In this section, we describe the general setup for the numerical simulations. We considered a power system with one utility company, and 100 users . We divided a day into 24 time-periods, labeled as . There were ten appliance types , that included base load as well as schedulable load. Each device had a specific operating characteristics that are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. For example, the first appliance which is a type I non-schedulable appliance with one operating mode, that consumes 1.32kWh of energy each hour corresponds to a refrigerator. Similarly the characteristics of the third appliance correspond a washer-dryer that is schedulable. These appliance characteristics were taken from the smart appliance report in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. For each user, we selected a random number and types of appliances and the appliance characteristics were selected according to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>.</p><p>For the generation cost of the utility company, we use the quadratic function, defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, with parameters and . The profit coefficient was selected to be 1.20. For the costs , and , we chose and , respectively. All the appliances were initialized to start at their ideal start times and operate in their ideal modes before the beginning of the optimization algorithm. The iterations of the distributed algorithm were terminated when the change in the user cost between successive iterations falls below a threshold for all the users. We chose .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Simulation Results</head><p>In this section we show results using the setup described in the previous subsection. We also compare our results with a sequential optimization framework in which the users update their scheduling vectors sequentially. As a result of the sequential updates, there is no need to penalize the cost in this case and hence the penalty coefficient . Both the sequential and the distributed optimizations use the algorithm in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> to find the optimal schedule of each device. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we plot the generation of the utility company before using optimization, and after using the sequential and the distributed optimizations. The total daily generation did not change much after optimization, but the peak generation significantly dropped, as the users shifted a part of their on-peak load to off-peak hours. Overall, the hourly generation was leveled after the optimization. This leveling benefits the utility because by avoiding using expensive secondary generators to satisfy peak user load, and the reduced peak load is beneficial for the stability of the power grid. Further, the leveling was much significant after using the sequential  optimization, but it comes at an additional implementation and communication overhead as each user has to communicate his schedule to a centralized processor to update the price.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, we plot the generation cost of the utility obtained using the sequential and the distributed optimization methods as function of the iteration index. As it can be seen, the generation cost for the utility company decreases with the iteration index.</p><p>The overall user cost is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> as a function of the iteration number. As it can be seen, the cost of all the users decreased with the iterations. The algorithm took about 30 iterations to converge.</p><p>The daily total daily bill (excluding the satisfaction costs for the mode and time deviations) for the user (in ) is calculated using the following equation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> where is the final price after the optimization. We plotted the daily user bill for the user set in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. The results indicate that the daily total pay for the users decreased. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, we plot the total cost before and after optimization. As it can be seen, the total cost decreased after the optimization.</p><p>We also mention that for this 100-user system, the number of iterations for the distributed optimization depended on the selected . The distributed optimization was done in parallel,  and thus the run time for each iteration is approximately of that of sequential optimization. The number of iterations for the distributed case decreased as increased. However, for a small , the algorithm no longer converges, as every user tries to schedule the appliance to minimize his own cost, thereby increasing the overall cost of the electricity due to an aggregated impact of their personal behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we propose appliance scheduling as a demand response scheme for a smart grid. Unlike the earlier approaches that either select an optimal start time or an optimal energy consumption, our model finds a joint solution by considering all the appliances to be operating in specific modes. Such modeling is also realistic, since it is easier to design appliances that can switch between various modes depending on the energy consumption. We select the optimal price that the utility company has to charge to be proportional to the generation cost. We then propose a distributed framework, where each user independently minimizes his own cost using a greedy approximation. The overall optimal behavior is enforced using the price vector, which acts as an invisible hand coordinating the interaction among the users, and the convergence of the algorithm is enforced by introducing a penalty term that penalizes large changes in the user schedule between iterations. Numerical simulations validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
