<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>x Preface Quantum computation, one of the latest joint ventures between physics and the theory of computation, is a scientific field whose main goals include the development of hardware and algorithms based on the quantum mechanical properties of those physical systems used to implement such algorithms.</p><p>Solving difficult tasks (for example, the Satisfiability Problem and other NP-complete problems) requires the development of sophisticated algorithms, many of which employ stochastic processes as their mathematical basis.</p><p>Discrete random walks are a popular choice among those stochastic processes. Inspired on the success of discrete random walks in algorithm development, quantum walks, an emerging field of quantum computation, is a generalization of random walks into the quantum mechanical world.</p><p>The purpose of this lecture is to provide a concise yet comprehensive introduction to quantum walks.</p><p>In addition to the Introduction chapter itself, our book starts with the three following chapters:</p><p>Chapter two introduces the postulates of quantum mechanics in a form suitable to be employed by computer scientists. By means of the state space postulate we present to the reader the quantum counterpart of the bit, the qubit. Moreover, the evolution postulate provides the mathematical structure that allows us to describe the behavior of a qubit as time passes by, while the measurement postulate presents the mathematical procedure to be employed in order to compute the probability distributions inherent to any computation based on quantum mechanics. We then introduce the most surprising (for a computer scientist) nocloning theorem, which states that it is impossible to make perfect copies of arbitrary quantum states, and finish this chapter by delivering the rules for working with two and more qubits, and by introducing the concept of quantum entanglement as a computational resource.</p><p>Chapter three provides some essential elements of the theory of computation necessary to show and quantify the role of discrete random walks in computer science. We particularly focus on classical and quantum versions of Turing machines as well as on the definitions and theorems of the theory of complexity that will allow us to quantify the amount of resources required to execute an algorithm. We then use those quantification methods to introduce the P and NP PREFACE xi algorithm classes, and finish this chapter by presenting the concept of NP-completeness as well as some fundamental links between physics and the theory of computation.</p><p>Chapter four starts with a succinct introduction to the definitions and main results in the field of discrete classical random walks, followed by concrete examples on the use of classical random walks in algorithm development for solving two versions of the Satisfiability Problem: 2SAT and 3SAT. This chapter finishes with a concise presentation of continuous random walks, a branch of stochastic processes seldom used in computer science but indeed relevant for our further discussion on successful quantum algorithms based on continuous quantum walks.</p><p>The second and last part of this lecture, composed of three chapters, provides a solid introduction to the physical, mathematical and computational properties of quantum walks.</p><p>Chapter five starts with a comprehensive analysis of a discrete quantum walk on an infinite line, in which we provide relevant definitions plus a study of the mathematical structure that defines the initial conditions, evolution and measurement of a quantum walker whose behavior in space-time is given by a quantum coin and corresponding operators. We then elaborate on the properties and probability distributions of discrete quantum walks on a line with one and two boundaries. This first part of chapter five finishes with the notion of a discrete quantum walk on a graph.</p><p>The second part of chapter five starts with an analysis of what is truly quantum about a quantum walk, in which we study some experiments that have shown that some properties of quantum walks are also reproducible by classical systems, and finish this analysis by listing some quantum mechanical properties of quantum walks.</p><p>We then proceed to define a continuous quantum walk, followed by a study about the role randomness plays in both continuous and discrete quantum walks. We finish this chapter with a study of a recent, long awaited and very important result: a mathematical connection between discrete and continuous quantum walks.</p><p>Chapter six is devoted to the use of both discrete and continuous quantum walks in algorithm development. We start by reviewing some early results on an algorithm based on a discrete quantum walk to find elements in an unordered set; this algorithm employs a hypercube as the geometrical structure on which the quantum walk is performed and uses two definitions of hitting time (i.e. the average time it takes to go from an arbitrary node i to an arbitrary node j) to show that, in both cases, hitting time is of polynomial order.</p><p>Chapter six continues with an analysis on a more recent algorithm which shows how to employ a discrete quantum walk to determine whether all elements in a set are distinct or not. We then review a new and refreshing definition of a discrete quantum walk, which consists of a derivation of an evolution operator from a classical stochastic matrix, and finish with a list of relevant papers on more algorithmic applications of quantum walks as well as some results</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>xii PREFACE</head><p>about the impact of decoherence (in this context, decoherence can be understood as performing measurements on the elements of the quantum walk) in the algorithmic performance of a discrete quantum walk.</p><p>The second part of chapter six reviews a most celebrated result on quantum Computation: an algorithm that employs a continuous quantum walk that traverses a family of graphs in polynomial time. This study is followed by a succinct review of an application of a generalized continuous quantum walk for quantum simulation. We finish chapter six by mentioning a very recent and most important result: the computational universality of quantum walks.</p><p>Finally, chapter seven provides a summary of our book and proposes some future research directions which, in the opinion of the author, will become increasingly important for both the field of quantum walks and the employment of quantum algorithms in several branches of science.</p><p>xiii Writing a book is an honor as it allows authors to talk to readers, to share passions and to propose new ideas, regardless of time differences or physical distance. Indeed, it is a matter of justice to acknowledge those who share with a writer the tremendous effort of writing and publishing a book.</p><p>I would like to start by acknowledging the loving support of my family for those endless hours that I did not share with them, even during very important festivities like Christmas and New Year's eve. My passion for science has always been supported by the tender patience and encouragement of my mother Amparo, my step-father Bernardo, my sister Samy, and my deceased grandmother Margarita. I warmly thank you all.</p><p>I would also like to thank my former DPhil supervisors Professor Keith Burnett and Professor Sougato Bose, who gave me the opportunity to do doctoral research on quantum walks at the University of Oxford. Among those great minds I was privileged to meet during my time in Oxford and who directly contributed to my understanding of quantum walks, I would like to mention Dr Jonathan Ball (who is also the artist who designed the Bloch sphere image used in our chapter on quantum mechanics) and Dr Nikola Paunković.</p><p>The idea of writing a book on quantum walks for Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers came to me from Professor Marco Lanzagorta, whose constant encouragement and friendship are very valuable to me and were crucial components of my enthusiasm during the long nights I spent working on this book. I also want to thank Professor Jeffrey K. Uhlmann who, together with Professor Lanzagorta, are the editors of Morgan &amp; Claypool Synthesis Lectures on Quantum Computing. Furthermore, I want to thank Dr Michael B. Morgan, President of Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, for believing in this project and in my capacity to write a book on the novel field of quantum walks.</p><p>I have been privileged enough to serve my beloved country, México, working as an assistant professor at Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Estado de México since 2006. Among the people I have had the honor and the privilege to meet and work for, I would like to mention Professor Pedro Grasa Soler, President of Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Estado de México, Professor Roberto Rueda Ochoa, President of the Central Zone of Tecnológico de Monterrey, and Professor Ricardo Swain Oropeza, head of the Engineering Division of Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Estado de México, as their support has been crucial since my first day in campus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Quantum Mechanics and the Theory of Computation are two of the most important intellectual achievements of the 20th century. These two branches of science have not only inspired several generations of scientists and thinkers, they have also had a significant impact on the daily life of mankind, from war to literature (two recent examples of works in the literature inspired by the ideas and history of quantum mechanics are <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>). As a matter of fact, cross-fertilization between physics and computation has been abundant due to the fact that many ideas, concepts, and technological developments from both fields have been used to advance knowledge in each discipline.</p><p>One of the most recent joint ventures between physics and the theory of computation is Quantum Computation. Quantum computation can be defined as the scientific field whose purpose is to solve problems with finite time procedures, i.e. algorithms, which exploit the quantum-mechanical properties of those physical systems that are used to implement such algorithms.</p><p>Among the theoretical discoveries and promising conjectures that have positioned quantum computation as a key element in modern science, we find (1) the development of novel and powerful methods of computation that may allow us to significantly increase our processing power for solving certain problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> and (2) the simulation of complex physical systems that no classical computer would be able, even in principle, to efficiently simulate <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A detailed summary of scientific and technological applications of quantum computers can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>As for the physical realization of quantum computers, several experimental platforms have been developed or customized over the last two decades. Indeed, although it is too early to predict the winning technologies for the implementation of quantum computers, encouraging advances have been made over the last few years in fields such as quantum optics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and ion traps <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Moreover, according to the quantum computation roadmaps produced in the United States of America in 2004 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the European Union in 2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, it is reasonable to expect quantum hardware with enough number of qubits and fault tolerant error correction ready to run quantum simulation and some quantum algorithms by 2012-2017. The reader will find comprehensive lists of physical platforms for quantum computation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>Building good quantum algorithms is a difficult task. First, quantum mechanics is a counterintuitive theory and intuition plays a major role in algorithm design. Second, for a quantum algorithm to be good it is not enough to perform the task it is intended to, but also to do better (i.e. to be more efficient) than any classical algorithm (at least better than those classical algorithms known at the time of developing corresponding quantum algorithm). Examples of successful results in quantum computation can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Good introductions to the first quantum algorithms can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 4</ref>] and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chs. 4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5 and 6]</ref>.</p><p>Among those techniques available for the development of quantum algorithms one finds Quantum Walks, which is also the main topic of this lecture.</p><p>In order to provide a definition of the field of quantum walks, we first introduce the concept of a stochastic algorithm. In the following paragraphs we shall assume that, in principle, the problems we intend to solve by using an algorithmic approach are indeed solvable by such a method.</p><p>There are several ways to design solutions (i.e. to develop algorithms) in computer science. For example, a powerful method consists of defining a set of rules such that for a given step i in algorithm A, we can always fully determine step i + 1, i.e. at any point of the execution of algorithm A we can be fully certain about the next step to be performed, as long as we know the rules of logic used to develop A. Algorithms developed under this methodology are known as deterministic algorithms because it is always possible to determine the exact behavior of those algorithms, just by knowing the starting conditions and the set of rules used for algorithm development.</p><p>Another method used in algorithm design makes use of chance. In this approach, for a given step s i of algorithm A, step s i+1 cannot be fully determined as there are several possible next steps. The actual step i + 1 that will be carried out is chosen from the set S of possible next steps with the help of a probability distribution. This family of algorithms is known as stochastic algorithms and plays the most important role in computer science due to the fact that, in some cases, the most efficient (or least inefficient, depending on the point of view) algorithms known so far for solving certain kinds of problems, are stochastic <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</p><p>A subtle but very important property of stochastic algorithms is the following: assume step s i of algorithm A is being executed and that there are several possible next steps s i+1 ∈ S. Then, all elements of S must have the same probability of being chosen, unless there is a very good reason for giving preference to some computational steps over others (for example, knowledge about the physical properties of a system to be simulated by the stochastic algorithm). The rationale here is that we want chance, i.e. randomness, to determine the evolution of our algorithm. However, if we introduce preferences for some computational steps over others, we are preventing randomness from taking over. Consequently, the generation of random numbers is a fundamental requirement for the execution of stochastic algorithms.</p><p>Unfortunately, classical computers are unable to generate truly random numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. To palliate this disadvantage, computer scientists have developed sophisticated programs for pseudo-random number generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> which are good enough for many practical applications of computer science into many branches of science and engineering. However, as true random numbers are still needed, sources of randomness have been produced by using the quantummechanical measurement postulate that we will explore in Chapter 2.</p><p>Classical random walks, a subset of stochastic processes (that is, processes whose evolution involves chance), have proved to be a very powerful tool for the development of stochastic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The main idea behind the mechanics of classical random walks is the following: assume we have a particle (walker) that is allowed to move on a lattice. The actual movements of the particle on the lattice, i.e. the evolution of the system, are performed according to a probability distribution. A simple example is the following: suppose that we have a particle on a line, and that the motion of that particle on a line (i.e. moving to the left or to the right) is performed according to the outcomes of tossing a coin (for example, heads → right and tails → left). This process is clearly stochastic and is known as a classical discrete random walk on a line.</p><p>Given the importance of classical random walks in algorithm development, there has been an increasing interest in studying quantum counterparts of classical random walks, known as quantum walks, in order to develop new quantum algorithms. As we shall see in corresponding chapters, there is already a series of quantum algorithms based on quantum walks that outperform their classical counterparts. Nonetheless, the field of quantum walks is very young and more research is needed to understand how to make full use of this discipline in quantum computation.</p><p>There are two main sets of quantum walks: discrete and continuous quantum walks. The main difference between these two sets is the timing used to apply corresponding evolution operators. In the case of discrete quantum walks, the corresponding evolution operator of the system is applied only in discrete time steps, while in the continuous quantum walk case, the evolution operator can be applied at any time.</p><p>Our approach in the development of this work has been to study those concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum computation relevant to the computational aspects of quantum walks. Thus, in the history of cross-fertilization between physics and computation, this lecture is meant to be situated as a novel contribution within the field of quantum computation from the perspective of a computer scientist. It has been the intention of this author to write a lecture from which computer scientists with no background in physics may obtain a succinct guide to the concepts of quantum mechanics needed to be initiated in the field of quantum walks.</p><p>Although we have assumed that the reader holds a good level of mathematical maturity, particularly in the field of linear algebra, in order to follow certain parts of Chapter 2, we provide a concise list of good introductory texts on that subject in the beginning of Chapter 2.</p><p>To the best of author's knowledge, this manuscript is the first book ever published on the topic of quantum walks, and its original approach may allow not only theoretical computer scientists, but also applied computer scientists and engineers to learn the foundations and algorithmic applications of quantum walks.</p><p>The following lines provide a summary of the main ideas and contributions of this lecture.</p><p>Chapter 2. Quantum Mechanics. This chapter is a concise introduction to the postulates of quantum mechanics (and the mathematical tools required to formulate those postulates) needed to understand the main concepts and techniques of quantum walks, as well as some of the foundational elements of quantum computation. We also provide a brief introduction to entanglement and Bell inequalities.</p><p>This chapter has been written with two purposes in mind: (1) to provide the necessary background for our work on quantum walks and (2) to serve as a concise guide for computer scientists who need to grasp those elements of quantum mechanics required to be initiated in the fields of quantum walks and, more generally, quantum computation. Chapter 3. Theory of Computation. We begin by briefly revisiting the historical roots of the mathematical development of Turing machines, followed by the enunciation of the Church-Turing thesis and the definition of decision problems in the context of computer science. We then proceed to formally define deterministic and nondeterministic models of computation.</p><p>We also introduce some formal elements of algorithmic complexity (mainly, measures used to quantify the performance of an arbitrary algorithm), followed by the topic of NP-completeness, one of the central themes in Complexity Theory, together with an example of NP-completeness: the satisfiability (SAT) problem. Finally, we provide a brief review on the links between physics and the theory of computation and give the definitions of Probabilistic and Quantum Turing machines.</p><p>Chapter 4. Classical Discrete Random Walks. The goal of this chapter is to provide a short but rigorous introduction to those properties of classical discrete random walks on undirected graphs relevant to algorithm development. We start by offering some basic elements of probability theory (several probability distributions, Markov's inequality and moments of probability distributions), followed by definitions and theorems of Markov chains and stationary probability distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION 5</head><p>We introduce the definition and main results of classical random walks on a line with three variants: no barriers, one absorbing barrier, and two absorbing barriers. In order to get more general results, we introduce classical random walks on (Cayley) graphs and present two measures used to quantify the performance of classical random walks in algorithm development: hitting time and mixing time.</p><p>The last part of this chapter begins with an analysis on the hitting and mixing times of a classical random walk on an unrestricted line. This analysis is, to the best of this author's knowledge, an original contribution to the field of classical random walks, at least in the form that information is presented and the explicit method used to quantify the hitting time of a classical random walk on an unrestricted line.</p><p>Basically, we show that the hitting time of a classical discrete random walk on an unrestricted line depends on the region we locate the walker in (we divide the line into two regions: the first one is the area within a distance roughly equal (up to a constant factor) to the standard deviation of the binomial distribution from the starting point of the walk, and the second is the rest of the line). Thus, if we use the hitting time of this random walk to quantify its corresponding mixing time (this is a usual practice in classical random walks), we find that the calculation of the mixing time of a classical random walk on an unrestricted line is not straightforward. This becomes an obstacle for comparing the performance of an unrestricted classical random walk on a line with its quantum counterpart. We will come back to this comparison shortly.</p><p>After studying the unrestricted classical random walk on a line, we quantify the hitting and mixing times of classical random walks on a line with two reflecting barriers, and on a circle. We finish this chapter by providing a detailed analysis of the randomized algorithms used to solve two versions of the SAT problem: 2-SAT and 3-SAT, as well as a concise introduction to classical continuous random walks.</p><p>Chapter 5. Quantum Walks. In this chapter we offer a comprehensive yet concise introduction to the main concepts, results, and algorithmic applications of discrete quantum walks on a line and on a graph. We first outline the main motivations for doing research in this field, followed by the mathematical description of the components of a quantum walk on a line.</p><p>We continue with a detailed analysis of the Hadamard quantum walk on an infinite line, using a method based on the Discrete Time Fourier Transform known as the Schrödinger approach. This analysis includes the enunciation of relevant theorems, as well as the advantages of the Hadamard quantum walk on an infinite line with respect to its closest classical counterpart. In particular, we explore the context in which the properties of the Hadamard quantum walk on an infinite line are compared with classical random walks on an infinite line and with two reflecting barriers. Also, we briefly review another method for studying the Hadamard walk on an infinite line: path counting approach. We then proceed to study a quantum walk on an infinite line with an arbitrary coin operator. In particular, we explain what is meant by stating that the study of the Hadamard quantum walk on an infinite line is enough as for the analysis of arbitrary quantum walks on an infinite line. To finish with our review on quantum walks on a line, we present the main results of quantum walks on a line with one and two absorbing barriers.</p><p>We then focus on the properties of quantum walks on graphs. We study quantum walks on a circle, on the hypercube, and some general properties of quantum walks on Cayley graphs. We continue this chapter with an analysis of the connections between classical and quantum walks, followed by a study of subtle but important aspects about the quantumness of quantum walks.</p><p>We then proceed to formally define a continuous quantum walk, and focus on issues about the randomness of quantum walks. Finally, we introduce a long-awaited result with respect to connecting the mathematical formalisms of discrete and continuous quantum walks, together with an analysis about whether coins are truly necessary in discrete quantum walks. Chapter 6. Computer Science and Quantum Walks. We review several links between computer science and quantum walks. We start by introducing how discrete quantum walks can be used to develop quantum algorithms for solving several variants of the search problem, namely the search of M (marked) elements in discrete (and possibly huge) datasets. We then proceed to introduce a novel algorithm based on a mixture of discrete quantum walks and quantum phase estimation for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The second part of this chapter is devoted to analyzing continuous quantum walks. We start by reviewing the most successful quantum algorithm based on a continuous quantum walk known so far, which consists of traversing, in polynomial time, a family of graphs of trees with an exponential number of vertices (the same family of graphs would be traversed only in exponential time by any classical algorithm). We then proceed to briefly review a generalization of a continuous quantum walk, now allowed to perform non-unitary evolution, in order to simulate photosynthetic processes, and we finish by reviewing very recent results about the computational universality of quantum walks.</p><p>We finish this introduction with a critical list of articles and books that would provide the reader with further information about the fields we have discussed in this lecture.</p></div>

In addition to the references provided at the beginning of this chapter, we would recommend <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> as an excellent introduction to linear algebra. In particular, the reader will find the proofs of all theorems mentioned in this section in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. We begin by defining Hilbert spaces, the spaces where mathematical descriptions of quantum physical systems live. Definition 2.1.1. Inner-product vector space. An inner-product vector space V is a complex vector space, equipped with an inner-product</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•|• : V × V → C, satisfying the following axioms: ∀ a, b, c, d ∈ V, α, β ∈ C (1) a|b = b|a * , (2) a|a ≥ 0 and a|a = 0 ⇔ a = 0,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>a|αb + βc = α a|b + β a|c . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>The inner product introduces the norm on V: ||a|| = √ a|a .</p><p>Definition 2.1.2. Complete inner-product vector space. An inner-product vector space V is called complete if for any sequence {a i } ∞ i=1 , a i ∈ V with the property lim i, j →∞ ||a ia j || = 0, there is a unique element b ∈ V such that lim j →∞ ||ba j || = 0. Definition 2.1.3. Hilbert space. A Hilbert space H is a complete inner-product vector space 2 . However, for the purposes of this lecture as well as for understanding the basics of quantum computation, it suffices to define a Hilbert space as an inner-product complex vector space. Definition 2.1.4. Isomorphism among Hilbert spaces. Two Hilbert spaces H 1 and H 2 are said to be isomorphic if the underlying vector spaces are isomorphic and their isomorphism preserves the inner product 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QUANTUM MECHANICS 11</head><p>Definition 2.1.5. Functional. Let V be a vector space over a field F. A linear functional is a linear function f : V → F. Lemma 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> Inner-product as linear mapping. Let H be a Hilbert space. Then, for each a ∈ H the function f a : H → C defined by f a (b) = a|b is a linear mapping. Therefore, function f a is a functional. Theorem 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. To each continuous linear mapping f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H → C there exists a unique φ f ∈ H such that f (ψ) = φ f |ψ for any ψ ∈ H.</formula><p>It is possible to prove that the space of all linear functionals of a Hilbert space H forms again a Hilbert space, the so-called dual Hilbert space H * over C. Furthermore, Theorem 1 proves that there is a bijection between H and H * , therefore H is isomorphic to H * . This isomorphism is the basis for the creation of the famous "bra-ket" Dirac notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Definition 2.1.6. Dirac notation. Let H be a Hilbert space. A vector ψ ∈ H is denoted |ψ and is referred as a ket. The corresponding linear functional is denoted ψ| and is referred to as bra.

Then, |ψ ∈ H can be represented as an n-dimensional column vector, and its corresponding functional ψ| ∈ H * can be seen as an n-dimensional row vector. Therefore, φ|ψ is the usual row-column matrix operator that computes the inner product in finite-dimensional vector spaces; |ψ ↔ ψ| corresponds to transposition and conjunction.</p><p>For example, let H 2 be a two-dimensional Hilbert space, B 1 = {|p , |q } be a basis of H 2 and |ψ ∈ H 2 . If α, β are the coefficients of |ψ with respect to B 1 , we can then write |ψ = α β and ψ| = (α * , β * ).</p><p>We now discuss linear operators in Hilbert spaces and their outer product representation.  Matrix representation of a linear operator. The action of a linear operator Â is independent of any basis or coordinate system. However, if we choose bases {|e i } and {| f i } for H 1 and H 2 , respectively, it is possible to give Â a matrix representation. For example, let us define the Pauli operators using the matrix representation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H 1 → H 2 such that ∀ |ψ i ∈ H 1 , α j ∈ C ⇒ Â m α m |ψ m = m α m Â(|ψ m ) = m α m |φ m ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">σ x = 0 1 1 0 ; σ y = 0 -i i 0 ; σ z = 1 0 0 -1 .

We use this fact to compute operator functions. Definition 2.1.13. Operator functions. Let f : C → C be a function and Â = i λ i |i i| be a spectral decomposition for a normal operator Â. Then, the operator function f ( Â) is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">f ( Â) ≡ i f (λ i )|i i|.</formula><p>Before we address the topic of creating vector spaces from other vector spaces, we introduce the notions of trace for matrices and linear operators.

Now we focus on the tensor product-a method to build vector spaces from other vector spaces. The tensor product is crucial in representing multiparticle quantum systems. Definition 2.1.15. Tensor product. Let V and W be vector spaces (over a field F) of dimension m and n, respectively. Let X be the tensor product of V and W, i.e. X = V ⊗ W. The elements of X are linear combinations of vectors |a ⊗ |b , where |a ∈ V and |b ∈ W. In particular, if {|i } and {| j } are orthonormal bases for V and W then {|i ⊗ | j } is a basis<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> for X. Let Â, B be linear operators on V and W, respectively.

Finally, we describe a theorem that will be used in the following section for entanglement quantification.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">POSTULATES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS</head><p>We now provide the postulates of quantum mechanics upon which we build up our work on quantum walks. In quantum mechanics there are two mathematical formalisms to describe a physical quantum system: state vectors and density operators. Both approaches are mathematically equivalent and, consequently, choosing one or the other is a matter of convenient description of the properties of the system to be studied. We formulate Postulates 1-4 in the parlance of state vectors following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and additionally define density operators in the context of Postulate 1. Alternative formulations of all postulates in the terminology of density operators can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">State Space</head><p>The first postulate provides the mathematical framework with which we describe closed (that is, isolated) physical systems.</p><p>Postulate 1. To each isolated physical system we associate a Hilbert space H, the state space of the system. The physical system is completely described by its state vector, which is a unit vector |ψ ∈ H. The dimension of H depends on the specific degrees of freedom of the physical property under consideration. Postulate 1 implies that a linear combination of state vectors is a state vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. This is known as the superposition principle and is a quantum-mechanical description of physical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. In particular, any vector state |ψ may be described as a superposition of basis states</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">{|e i } in H, i.e. |ψ = i c i |e i , c i ∈ C.</formula><p>An alternative description of quantum states is given by the density operator (also called density matrix). The density operator is positive Hermitian and has trace equal to 1. A quantum system whose state |ψ is exactly known is said to be in a pure state. The density operator of a pure state is given by ρ = |ψ ψ|. A density operator also describes mixed quantum states. A mixed state may be obtained from a source randomly producing pure states. For example, suppose that a quantum system has a quantum state picked up from a set of possible quantum states {|ψ i } according to a probability distribution { p i }. Then its density operator is given by ρ = i p i |ψ i ψ|.</p><p>(2.5) Density operators do not uniquely represent a probability distribution over pure states, as it is possible to have two different quantum state ensembles giving rise to the same density operator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Qubit</head><p>In classical computation, information is stored and manipulated in the form of bits. The mathematical structure of a classical bit is rather simple. It suffices to define two "logical" values, traditionally labeled as {0, 1}, and to relate these values to two different outcomes of a classical measurement (for example, in TTL transistor technology, "0" is a label given to a voltage measurement between 0 V and 0.5 V, while "1" is the label attached to a voltage measurement between 4.5 V and 5 V). So, a classical bit "lives" in a scalar space.</p><p>In quantum computation, information is stored, manipulated, and measured in the form of qubits. A qubit is a physical entity described by the laws of quantum mechanics. Simple examples of qubits include two orthogonal polarizations of a photon (e.g. horizontal and vertical), the alignment of a (spin-1/2) nuclear spin in a magnetic field or two states of an electron orbiting an atom. A qubit may be mathematically represented as a unit vector in a two-dimensional Hilbert |ψ ∈ H 2  The numbers θ and ϕ define a point on the unit three-dimensional sphere known as Bloch sphere (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref></p></div>

The Hamiltonian of particular physical systems must be determined and calculated for each case. In general, figuring out the Hamiltonian of a particular physical system is a difficult task.</p><p>In this lecture we make extensive use of the Hadamard operator (Eq. (2.4)) as evolution operator, among others. The effect of the Hadamard operator as evolution operator is exemplified in the following two equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Ĥ|0 = 1 √ 2 [|0 0| + |0 1| + |1 0| -|1 1|]|0 = 1 √ 2 (|0 + |1 ), Ĥ|1 = 1 √ 2 [|0 0| + |0 1| + |1 0| -|1 1|]|1 = 1 √ 2 (|0 -|1 ).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Quantum Measurements</head><p>In quantum mechanics, measurement is a non-trivial and highly counter-intuitive process for several reasons: first, because measurement outcomes are inherently probabilistic, i.e. regardless of the carefulness in the preparation of a measurement procedure, the possible outcomes of such measurement will be distributed according to a certain probability distribution. Second, once a measurement has been performed, a quantum system in unavoidably altered due to the interaction with the measurement apparatus. Consequently, for an arbitrary quantum system, pre-measurement and post-measurement quantum states are different in general. Third, in order to perform a measurement it is needed to define a set of measurement operators. This set of operators must fulfil a number of rules that allows one to compute the actual probability distribution as well as post-measurement quantum states.</p><p>Postulate 3. Quantum measurements are described by a set of measurement operators { Ôn }, index n labels the different measurement outcomes, which act on the state space of the system being measured. Measurement outcomes correspond to the values of observables, such as position, energy, and momentum, which are Hermitian operators (Def. 2.1.9) corresponding to physically measurable quantities. A projective measurement is described by an observable M, a Hermitian operator (Def. 2.1.9) defined in the state space of the quantum system. By using the spectral decomposition</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QUANTUM MECHANICS 19</head><p>Theorem 2, it is possible to write M as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">M = i r i Pr i , (2.11)</formula><p>where Pr i is the projector operator for the eigenspace E(r i ) defined by the eigenvalue r i . Measurement outcomes correspond to the eigenvalues r i of observable M.</p><p>Let |ψ be the state of the quantum system immediately before the measurement. Then, the probability that result r i occurs is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">p(r i ) = ψ| Pr i |ψ , (<label>2.12)</label></formula><p>and the post-measurement quantum state |ψ pm associated with outcome r i is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">|ψ pm = Pr i |ψ p(r i ) . (2.13)</formula><p>Let us work out a simple example. Assume we have a photon with associated polarization orientations "horizontal" and "vertical." The horizontal polarization direction is denoted by |0 and the vertical polarization direction is denoted by |1 . By Postulate 1 (Eq. (2.6)), an arbitrary initial state for our photon can be described by the quantum state |ψ = α|0 + β|1 , <ref type="bibr">(2.14)</ref> where α and β are complex numbers constrained by the normalization condition |α| 2 + |β| 2 = 1, and {|0 , |1 } is the computational basis spanning H 2 . In other words, the polarization of an arbitrary photon is neither only vertical or only horizontal, but a linear combination of both polarizations. One way to look at Eq. (2.14) is to think of the corresponding photon as having both vertical and horizontal polarization simultaneously. If we think of photon polarization as a degree of freedom for storing information, we may think of such a photon as a qubit with both "0" and "1" values simultaneously stored in its polarization.</p><p>Now we construct two measurement operators Pa 0 = |0 0| and Pa 1 = |1 1| with corresponding measurement outcomes r 0 , r 1 . Then, the full observable used for measurement in this experiment is M = r 0 |0 0| + r 1 |1 1|. According to Postulate 3, we can say the following:</p><p>(1) There are only two possible measurement outcomes for observable M: r 0 and r 1 .</p><p>(2) According to Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">ENTANGLEMENT</head><p>Entanglement is a unique type of correlation shared between components of a quantum system. Entangled quantum systems are sometimes best used collectively, that is, sometimes an optimal use of entangled quantum systems for information storage and retrieval includes manipulating and measuring those systems as a whole, rather than on an individual basis. Quantum entanglement and the principle of superposition are two of the main concepts behind the power of quantum computation and quantum information theory.</p><p>The concept of correlation is deeply rooted in every branch of science. A typical and simple example is the following experiment: let us suppose we have two balls, one white and one black, as well as two boxes. If we randomly put a ball in each box and then close both boxes, we need to perform only one experiment, that is, to open one box, in order to know which of the balls is in each box. In other words, by means of one measurement, namely opening one box and seeing which ball was stored in it, we obtain two pieces of information, namely the color of the ball stored in each box.</p><p>The former experiment is an example of classical correlation. Quantum entanglement is also a kind of correlation, but one that is detected only in quantum phenomena. A good example of the difference between classical and quantum correlations would be correlations in canonically conjugate observables, such as position and momentum.</p><p>Consider the following 2-particle state:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">| -= |01 -|10 √ 2 . (2.20)</formula><p>Clearly, | -lives in a four-dimensional Hilbert space. It can be seen, after some calculations, that it is impossible to find quantum states |a , |b ∈ H 2 such that |a ⊗ |b = | -, that is, | -is not a product state of |a and |b . This is indeed a criterion to determine whether a quantum state is entangled or not, whether it is possible to express such a composite quantum state as a simple tensor product of quantum subsystems. Another example is the tripartite entangled GHZ state</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">|GHZ = |000 + |111 √ 2 .

Currently it is known how to identify and quantify entanglement for two particles, but for three or more particles the situation is far less straightforward and remains an active area of research.</p></div>

Thus, for the sake of providing a brief introduction to Bell inequalities for computer scientists as well as for the potential use of these ideas in physical realizations of quantum computers, we discuss some of the main concepts behind Bell inequalities.</p><p>The counter-intuitive properties of quantum mechanics have always been a source of controversy. In their seminal paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) proposed a thought experiment with which they tried to show that quantum mechanics was an incomplete theory of Nature. The thought experiment proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> was developed under the following lines of thought.</p><p>1. Assumption of Realism. Physical properties have definite values which exist independent of observation.</p><p>2. Assumption of Locality. The description of a system's state depends only in itself and its immediate surroundings. Therefore, for sufficiently separated physical systems, measurements performed on one of them cannot have any influence on the others. These two assumptions together are known as local realism. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, quantum mechanics was an incomplete theory under a local realistic description of Nature.</p><p>The discussion about the controversial properties of quantum mechanics shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> was considered to be just philosophical for long time. However, in 1964, Bell published <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, in which he derived an inequality (involving correlated measurement results) that would have to be obeyed by any system behaving under the rules of local realism. Furthermore, it was also shown that for some entangled systems the inequality would be violated. Naturally, testing whether Nature was in fact local-realistic became an appealing idea.</p><p>A number of experiments <ref type="bibr">[22, p. 12]</ref> have shown strong evidence that the inequality proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> is not obeyed by Nature <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> . Furthermore, the quantum-mechanical prediction was confirmed. The violation of Bell inequalities implies that at least one of the assumptions of QUANTUM MECHANICS <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> local realism is in conflict with quantum mechanics.

The development of the theory of computation was driven in great part by several challenges posed by D. Hilbert and other mathematicians on the foundations of mathematics at the beginning of the 20th century <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">THE BIRTH OF THE THEORY OF COMPUTATION: ALAN TURING AND HIS MACHINES</head><p>In 1936, Alan Turing published the most influential paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> in which he pioneered the theory of computation, introducing the famous abstract computing machines now known as Turing Machines. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, Turing explained the fundamental principle of the modern computer, the idea of controlling the machine's operation by means of a program of coded instructions stored in the computer's memory, i.e. Turing showed that it was possible to build a Universal Turing Machine, that is, a Turing machine capable of simulating any other Turing machine (in nowadays jargon, the Universal Turing Machine would be the actual digital computer and the simulated Turing machine the program that has been encoded in the digital computer's memory). Among Turing's key contributions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, we find: (1) a definition of procedure, which evolved into the modern definition of algorithm, (2) the Church-Turing thesis: every function that would be naturally regarded as computable can be computed by the Universal Turing Machine, and (3) the definition of a Turing machine. Now we shall briefly review the definitions of deterministic and nondeterministic computation, together with the definitions of deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">DETERMINISTIC AND NONDETERMINISTIC COMPUTATION</head><p>When every step of a computation follows in a unique way from the preceding step, we are doing deterministic computation. In the nondeterministic computation, several choices may exist for the next state at any point. How does a nondeterministic machine (NDM) compute? Suppose that we are running an NDM on an input string and reach a state with multiple states to proceed. At this point, the machine splits into multiple copies of itself and follows all the possibilities in parallel. Each copy of the machine takes one of the possible ways to proceed and continues as before. In the case of subsequent choices, the machine splits again. If the next input symbol does not appear on any of the arrows exiting the state occupied by a copy of the machine, that copy of the machine dies. Finally, if any one of these copies of the machine is in an accept state at the end of the input, the NDM accepts the input string.</p><p>Another way to think of a nondeterministic computation is as a tree of possibilities. The root of the tree corresponds to the start of the computation. Every branching point in the tree corresponds to a point in the computation at which the machine has multiple choices. The machine accepts if at least one of the computation branches ends in an accept state. A graphical illustration of a nondeterministic computation is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1. Note that nondeterminism is a generalization of determinism.</p><p>Under the laws of classical physics, nondeterminism is not a fully realistic model of computation as it assumes the capability of producing several instances of a machine to run in parallel: it would be like suddenly producing as many computers as instances for each computation step. The importance of nondeterministic computation is based on having a </p></div>

However, there has been significant efforts toward finding physical methods for implementing nondeterministic computation. For example, nondeterminism may be viewed as a kind of pseudo-parallel computation wherein multiple independent processes can be running concurrently (an NDM splitting to follow several choices may be thought of as a process forking into several children, each proceeding separately).</p><p>Another method is to randomly choose a branch from a nondeterministic computation tree. Although this stochastic approach is not entirely equivalent to following all possible branches of the same tree, this method has proven very fruitful to attack several key problems in computer science, known as NP-complete problems. We shall briefly review the ideas behind NP-completeness in the following section.</p><p>A third approach toward implementing nondeterministic computation is to incorporate quantum mechanics in algorithm development, for the following reasons: (1) quantum superposition can be used to compute several instances of the same problem (for example, computing the values of a function for many elements in its domain). This is known as quantum parallelism <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. (2) Furthermore, the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement may be used to randomly choose branches from a nondeterministic computation tree. Now let us briefly remind the reader of the definitions of the deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines. These definitions will be very useful for providing a mathematical description of a quantum Turing machine.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">PHYSICS AND THE THEORY OF COMPUTATION</head><p>Considerations about the physical properties of systems used to do computation and/or transmission of information have been studied for several decades. Consequently, physics and computer science have cross-fertilized each other for long time. As early as in the 1940s, in the beginning of the digital computer era, scientists wondered about the existence and quantification of the minimum amount of energy required to perform a computation. von Neumann, in a set of lectures delivered in 1949 <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, showed that "a minimum amount of energy required per elementary decision of a two-way alternative and the elementary transmittal of one unit of information" was close to kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature of the system. Later on, Landauer studied the relationship between energy consumption and reversible computation (a computational step is reversible iff given the output of that step, its input is uniquely determined<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">2</ref> ). Among those results published by Landauer in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, we have the following principle.</p><p>Landauer's principle. Suppose a computer erases a single bit of information. The amount of energy dissipated into the environment is at least kT ln 2, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature of the environment of the computer.</p></div>

Every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means.

For it would surely be hard to regard a function 'naturally' as computable if it could not be computed in Nature, and conversely."

A random walk, starting from a vertex u ∈ V is the random process defined by s = u repeat choose a neighbor v of u according to a certain probability distribution P u = v until (stop condition) So, we start at a node v 0 and, if at t-th step we are at a node v t , we move to a neighbor of v t with probability given by probability distribution P .

Examples of discrete random walks on graphs are a classical random walk on a circle or on a three-dimensional mesh.</p><p>We now introduce several measures to quantify the performance of discrete random walks on graphs.

The hitting time H i j is the expected number of steps before node j is visited, starting from node i.</head><p>CLASSICAL RANDOM WALKS 51 Definition 4.2.4. Mixing rate. The mixing rate is a measure of how fast the discrete random walk converges to its limiting distribution. The mixing rate can be defined in many ways, depending on the type of graph we want to work with. We use the definition given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>If the graph is non-bipartite then p t i j → d j /2m as t → ∞, and the mixing rate is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_99">µ = lim t→∞ sup max p (t) i j - d j 2m 1/t .</formula><p>As it is the case with the mixing rate, the mixing time can be defined in several ways. Basically, the notion of mixing time comprises the number of steps one must perform a classical discrete random walk before its distribution is close to its limiting distribution. Definition 4.2.5. Mixing time <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. Let M G be an ergodic Markov chain which induces a probability distribution P u (t) on the states at time t. Also, let -→ π denote the limiting distribution of M G . The mixing time τ is then defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">τ = max u min t {t|t ≥ T ⇒ ||P u (t) --→ π || &lt; }</formula><p>where ||P u (t) --→ π || is a standard distance measure. For example, we could use the total variation distance, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_101">||P u (t) --→ π || = 1 2 i |P u i (t) -π i |.</formula><p>Thus, the mixing time is defined as the first time t such that P u (t) is within distance of -→ π at all subsequent time steps t ≥ T, irrespective of the initial state.</p><p>Calculating mixing times is a difficult task. Consequently, there are several strategies to compute mixing times. Among them we find the coupling time strategy, which consists of considering two discrete random walks on a Markov chain. By starting one of the random walks from the stationary distribution and bounding the time for the two chains to collide, we can compute bounds on the mixing time of the random walk. What does it mean to make two chains collide? That means that both chains will end up hitting the same nodes with the same probability. To formalize this concept, let us present the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 10. Let P and Q be two probability distributions with P (t)  x and Q (t)  x the probabilities of hitting node x at time t ⇒ |P -Q| ≤ 2 pr (P (t)  x = Q (t) x ).</p><p>So, the computation of the mixing time of a Markov chain by means of the coupling strategy consists of the following steps: 1. Compute the limiting distribution of the Markov chain. 2. Compute the time it takes to obtain the following equality: P (t)  x = π x , where π x is the probability of hitting node x according to the Markov chain's limiting distribution -→ π . This step is usually equivalent to computing the hitting time of the Markov chain for a certain node. The key question is: how many steps n does it take to hit node k?</p></div>

Note that j + 2i ≤ n + 2n = 3n is a necessary condition (otherwise algorithm 2 would never reach state 0).</p><p>By calculating the number of paths which take the walker from j to 0 with i steps in the "wrong" direction and following the mathematical details provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, it is possible to conclude that the probability p is given by p ≥ ( 1 2 (1 + 1 k-1 )) n . Therefore, the complexity of algorithm 2 is within a polynomial factor of (2(1 -1 k )) n .</p></div>

We now extend our study to random walks defined in continuous spaces. Continuous random walks are a subfield of Markov processes, a branch of mathematics extensively used in many fields of physics and engineering. Furthermore, the concepts of continuous Markov processes have been extended into theoretical and applied computer science like Machine Learning (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>) and some links between continuous Markov processes, quantum mechanics and computer science have been developed over the last few years (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASSICAL RANDOM WALKS 59</head><p>In this section we shall briefly study the definitions of two different kinds of continuous random walks: those that are performed on continuous graphs and continuous time, and those defined on discrete graphs and continuous time.</p><p>Let G = (V, E) be a regular isotropic graph, i.e. a graph with constant vertex degree and with equal transition probability between neighboring sites. Now, suppose that the distance d i j between nodes of the graph decreases, i.e. d i j → 0. Also, suppose that the transition time between nodes is now a real non-negative value rather than a discrete variable, i.e. t ∈ R + ∪ {0} instead of t ∈ N ∪ {0}.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantum Walks</head><p>Quantum walks are quantum counterparts of classical random walks. As shown in our previous chapter, classical random walks have been successfully adopted to develop classical algorithms. Since one of the main topics in quantum computation is the creation of quantum algorithms which are faster than their classical counterparts, there has been a huge interest in understanding the properties of quantum walks over the last few years. In addition to their usage in computer science, the study of quantum walks is relevant to building methods in order to test the "quantumness" of emerging technologies for the creation of quantum computers.</p><p>Quantum walks is a new research topic. Although some authors have selected the name "quantum random walk" to refer to quantum phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref> and, in fact, in the seminal work by Feynman's about quantum-mechanical computers <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref> we find a proposal that could be interpreted as a (continuous) quantum walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>, it is generally accepted that the first paper with quantum walks as its main topic was published in 1993 by Aharonov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. Thus, the links between classical random walks and quantum walks, as well as the utility of quantum walks in computer science, are two fresh and open areas of research. As we have seen in the previous chapter, there is a theory of classical random walks on finite graphs that, although still far from complete, it has been fruitful in algorithm development. In order to fully capitalize quantum walks in computer science, we still need to do more work on performance measures to compare quantum and classical performance, as well as to produce new ideas on how to benefit from applying quantum walks in algorithm design (as we shall see in the following chapter, some algorithms based on quantum walks have already been proposed, but only one algorithm based on a continuous quantum walk has rendered an exponential speedup with respect to its classical counterparts).</p><p>Two models of quantum walks have been suggested: -The first model, called discrete quantum walks, consists of two quantum-mechanical systems (a walker and a coin) as well as an evolution operator which is applied to both systems only in discrete time steps although, as we shall see in the following lines, there are some proposals about avoiding the use of coins <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">108]</ref> in discrete quantum walks. Discrete quantum walks with coins are also called coined discrete quantum walks.</p><p>-In the second model, named continuous quantum walks, the evolution operator of the system can be applied at any time.</p><p>In both cases, the quantum walk is performed on discrete graphs (a summary of the basics of both kinds of quantum walks can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>).</p><p>The original idea behind the construction of quantum algorithms was to start by initializing a set of qubits and then to apply (one of more) evolution operators several times without performing intermediate measurements, as measurements were meant to be performed only at the end of the computational process. By doing so, quantum interference would cause a behavior radically different from that of a classical algorithm.</p><p>Not surprisingly, quantum algorithms based on quantum walks have been designed using the same strategy: initialize qubits, apply evolution operators and measure only to calculate the final outcome of the algorithm. Indeed, this method has proved itself very useful for building several remarkable algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">109]</ref>. However, it has recently been reported that performing (partial) measurements on a quantum walk may lead to interesting mathematical properties for algorithm development, like the "top hat" probability distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">111]</ref>.</p><p>Quantum walks is a new tool expected to play a major role in the field of quantum algorithms, and a number of benefits of employing such walks in algorithm development are already known, as we shall see in the following chapter.</p><p>The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. We begin by delivering a detailed analysis of the unrestricted discrete quantum walk on a line with a Hadamard coin operator, followed by an examination of a discrete quantum walk on a line with a general coin, and the effect of using several kinds of coins in quantum walks. We then proceed to review some results on quantum walks on a line with boundaries, followed by a summary of properties and main results on quantum walks on graphs. We then briefly review some studies that focus on the transition between classical to quantum walks and vice versa, as well as on the "quantumness" of quantum walks and the role of entanglement in discrete quantum walks.</p><p>The second and last parts of this chapter provide a succinct introduction to continuous quantum walks, move ahead with an analysis of the randomness of a quantum walk and then focus on how continuous and discrete quantum walks are connected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">QUANTUM WALK ON A LINE</head><p>Discrete quantum walks on a line (DQWL) is the most studied model of discrete quantum walks. As its name suggests, this kind of quantum walks are performed on graphs G = (V, E) of degree |V | = 2 (Def. 4.2.1). Studying DQWL is important in quantum computation for several reasons, including:</p><p>1. DQWL can be used to build quantum walks on more sophisticated structures like circles or general graphs. 2. DQWL is a simple model that can be exploited to explore, find and understand relevant properties of quantum walks for the development of quantum algorithms.</p><p>3. DQWL can be employed to test the quantumness of experimental realizations of quantum computers.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, Meyer made two contributions to the study of DQWL while studying the models of Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) and Quantum Lattice Gases: 1. He proposed a model of quantum dynamics that would be used later on to analytically characterize DQWL. 2. He showed that a quantum process in which, at each time step, a quantum particle (the walker) moves in superposition both to left and right with equal amplitudes, is physically impossible in general, the only exception being the trivial motion in a single direction.</p><p>In order to perform a discrete DQWL with non-trivial evolution, it was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">113]</ref> to use an additional quantum system: a coin. Thus, a DQWL comprises two quantum systems, coin and walker, along with a coin unitary operator (to toss a coin) and a conditional shift operator (to displace the walker either to the left or right depending on the accompanying coin state component).</p><p>In a different perspective, Patel et al. proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> to eliminate the use of coins by rearranging the Hamiltonian operator associated with the evolution operator of the quantum walk (however, there is a price to be paid on the translation invariance of the quantum walk). Moreover, Hines and Stamp have proposed the development of quantum walk Hamiltonians <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref> in order to reflect the properties of potential experimental realizations of quantum walks in their mathematical structure.</p><p>Motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, Hamada et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref> wrote a general setting for QCA, developed a correspondence between DQWL and QCA, and applied this connection to show that the quantum walk proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> could be modeled as a QCA. The relationship between QCA and quantum walks has been indirectly explored by Meyer <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. Additionally, Konno et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> have studied the relationship between quantum walks and cellular automata, and it has been shown by van Dam <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> that it is possible to build a quantum cellular automaton capable of universal computation. Studying the relationship between QCA and quantum walks may lead to interesting computability properties of quantum walks.</p><p>The rest of this section is organized as follows. First, we review the mathematical structure of a coined DQWL. We then proceed to study in detail the properties of a discrete quantum walk on an infinite line, followed by the cases of one and two absorbing boundaries. We finish with a study on the impact of using multiple coins on quantum walks on a line.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Structure of a Coined DQWL</head><p>The main components of a coined DQWL are a walker, a coin, evolution operators for both walker and coin, and a set of observables: Walker and Coin: The walker is a quantum system living in a Hilbert space of infinite but countable dimension H p . It is customary to use vectors from the canonical (computational) basis of H p as "position sites" for the walker. So, we denote the walker as |position ∈ H p and affirm that the canonical basis states |i p that span H p , as well as any superposition of the form i α i |i p subject to i |α i | 2 = 1, are valid states for |position . The walker is usually initialized at the "origin," i.e. |position initial = |0 p .</p><p>The coin is a quantum system living in a two-dimensional Hilbert space H c . The coin may take the canonical basis states |0 and |1 as well as any superposition of these basis states. Therefore, |coin ∈ H c and a general normalized state of the coin may be written as |coin = a|0 c + b|1 c , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_117">|a| 2 + |b| 2 = 1.</formula><p>The total state of the quantum walk resides in H t = H p ⊗ H c . So far, only product states of H t have been used as initial states, that is, |ψ initial = |position initial ⊗ |coin initial . Evolution Operators: The evolution of a quantum walk is divided into two parts that closely resemble the behavior of a classical random walk. In the classical case, chance plays a key role in the evolution of the system. This is evident in the following example: we first toss a coin (either biased or unbiased) and then, depending on the coin outcome, the walker moves one step either to the right or to the left.</p><p>In the quantum case, the equivalent of the previous process is to apply an evolution operator to the coin state followed by a conditional shift operator to the total quantum system. The purpose of the coin operator is to render the coin state in a superposition, and the randomness is introduced by performing a measurement on the system after both evolution operators have been applied to the total quantum system several times.</p><p>Among coin operators, customarily denoted by Ĉ, the Hadamard operator (Eq. (2.4)) has been extensively employed. For convenience we show it again in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_118">Ĥ = 1 √ 2 (|0 c 0| + |0 c 1| + |1 c 0| -|1 c 1|). (5.1)</formula><p>For the conditional shift operator use is made of a unitary operator that allows the walker to go one step forward if the accompanying coin state is one of the two basis states (e.g. |0 ), or one step backwards if the accompanying coin state is the other basis state (|1 ). A suitable QUANTUM WALKS <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> conditional shift operator has the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_119">Ŝ = |0 c 0| ⊗ i |i + 1 p i| + |1 c 1| ⊗ i |i -1 p i|.</formula><p>(5.2)</p><p>Consequently, the operator on the total Hilbert space is Û = Ŝ • ( Ĉ ⊗ Îp ) and a succinct mathematical representation of a quantum walk after t steps is</p><formula xml:id="formula_120">|ψ t = ( Û ) t |ψ initial , (<label>5.3)</label></formula><p>where |ψ initial = |position initial ⊗ |coin initial .</p><p>Observables: Several advantages of quantum walks over classical random walks are a consequence of interference effects between coin and walker after several applications of Û (other advantages come from quantum entanglement between walker(s) and coin(s) as well as partial measurement and/or interaction of coins and walkers with the environment). However, we perform a measurement at some point in order to know the outcome of our walk. To do so, we define a set of observables according to the basis states that have been used to define coin and walker.</p><p>There are several ways to extract information from the composite quantum system. For example, we may first perform a measurement on the coin using the observable</p><formula xml:id="formula_121">Mc = α 0 |0 c 0| + α 1 |1 c 1|.</formula><p>(5.4)</p><p>A measurement must then be performed on the position states of the walker by using the operator Mp = i a i |i p i|.</p><p>(5.5)</p><p>We show in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.1 the probability distributions of two 100-steps DQWL. Coin and shift operators for both quantum walks are given by Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2), respectively. The DQWLs from plots (a) and (b) have corresponding initial quantum states |0 c ⊗ |0 p and |1 c ⊗ |0 p . The first evident property of these quantum walks is the skewness of their probability distributions, as well as the dependence of the symmetry of such a skewness from the coin initial quantum state (|0 for plot (a) and |1 for plot (b)). This skewness comes from constructive and destructive interference due to the minus sign included in Eq. (5.1). Also, we note a quasi-uniform behavior in the central area of both probability distributions, approximately in the interval <ref type="bibr">[-70, 70]</ref>. Finally, we note that regardless their skewness, both probability distributions cover the same number of positions (in this case, even positions from -100 to 100. If the quantum walk had  been performed an odd number of times, then only odd position sites could have non-zero probability). A few steps of a DQWL are presented immediately after Eq. (5.7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Analysis of Quantum Walks on an Infinite Line</head><p>Two approaches have been extensively used to study DQWL: 1. Schrödinger approach. In this case, we take an arbitrary component |ψ n = (α|1 c + QUANTUM WALKS 67 β|0 c ) ⊗ |n p of the quantum walk, the tensor product of coin and position components for a certain walker position. |ψ n is then Fourier-transformed in order to get a closed form of the coin amplitudes.

Then, as t → ∞, we have (uniformly in n) p L (n, t) 2 π √ 1 -2α 2 t cos 2 -ωt + π 4 -ρ , p R (n, t) 2(1 + α) π (1 -α) √ 1 -2α 2 t cos 2 -ωt + π 4 ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_151">ω = αρ + θ , ρ = arg(-B + √ ), θ = arg(B + 2 + √ ), B = 2α 1-α , and = B 2 - 4(B + 1).

The wavefunction L (n, t) and R (n, t) (Theorem 1) is almost uniformly spread over the region for which α is in the interval [-1/ √ 2, 1/ √ 2] (Theorem 2), and shrinks quickly outside this region (Theorem 3). Furthermore, by integrating the probability functions from Theorem 2, it is possible to see that almost all of the probability is concentrated in the interval [(-</p><formula xml:id="formula_152">1/ √ 2 + )t, (1/ √ 2 -)t].</formula><p>In fact, the exact probability value in that interval is</p><formula xml:id="formula_153">P = 1 -2 π -O(1)</formula><p>t . 2. Standard deviation. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">113]</ref>, the zeroth and second moments of the probability distribution from Theorem 2 are</p><formula xml:id="formula_154">µ 1 = 1- √ 2 √ 2 and µ 2 = √ 2-1 √</formula><p>2 , respectively. Being rigorous, and taking into account that both moments were computed using normalized (over the total number of steps t) probability distributions, then the variance of the Hadamard walk is given by Eq. (4.5):</p><formula xml:id="formula_155">σ 2 Ĥ = µ 2 -µ 2 1 = √ 2 -1 √ 2 t - 1 - √ 2 √ 2 t 2 .</formula><p>(</p><p>That is, σ 2 Ĥ = O(t 2 ) and, consequently,</p><formula xml:id="formula_157">σ Ĥ = O(t).</formula><p>(5.26)</p><p>However, the second moment has also been interpreted <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">126]</ref> as the actual variance of the probability distribution given in Theorem 2. Furthermore, by introducing a novel method to compute the probability distribution X of the unrestricted DQWL, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref> that</p><formula xml:id="formula_158">σ (X) t → √ 2-1 2</formula><p>as t → ∞. In any case, the standard deviation of the unrestricted Hadamard DQWL is O(t) and that result is in contrast with the standard deviation of an unrestricted classical random walk on a line, which is O( √ t) (Eq. (4.12)). 3. Mixing time. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">113]</ref> that an unrestricted Hadamard DQWL has a linear mixing time τ (q ) = O(t), where t is the number of steps. Furthermore, τ (q ) was compared with the corresponding mixing time of a classical random walk on a line, which is quadratic, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_159">τ (c ) = O(t 2 ).</formula><p>In order to properly bound and evaluate the impact of this result in the fields of quantum walks and quantum computation, a few clarifications are needed.</p><p>(a) The mixing time measure used in this case is not the same as Eq. (4.2.5), the reason being that unitary Markov chains in finite state space (such as finite graph analogues of quantum </p><formula xml:id="formula_160">(t) -π || ≤ }</formula><p>which is a more relaxed definition in the sense that it measures the first time that the current probability distribution P u (t) is -close to the stationary distribution, without the requirement of continuing being -close for all future steps.</p><p>(b) The stationary distribution of an unrestricted classical random walk on a line is the binomial distribution, spread all over Z. The only difference between P t , the probability distribution of an unrestricted classical random walk on a line at step t, and its limiting distribution P is the numerical value of the probability assigned to each node, as the shape of the distribution is the same. Although the binomial distribution can be roughly approximated by a uniform distribution for large values of t, depending on the precision we need for a certain task, that comparison is not precise.</p><p>We can adopt the hitting time of an unrestricted classical random walk on a line together with Theorem 10 to figure out its corresponding mixing time. As shown in our chapter on classical random walks, the hitting time of an unrestricted classical random walk on a line depends on the region we are looking into. Specifically, the hitting time is O( √ t) for k t and O(2 t ) for k ≈ t (Eqs. (4.17) and (4.18)). Thus, to hit node k with equal probabilities P t k = P k may depend on the region where k is located. For example, it may take O( √ t) if k t and O(2 t ) if k ≈ t. As previously expressed, it seems that more analysis and new methods for studying mixing times on unrestricted classical random walks are required, particularly within the framework of algorithm development.</p><p>So, comparing mixing times for quantum and classical unrestricted walks on a line is not necessarily clear and straightforward. Furthermore, and in order to reduce complexity in the analysis of algorithms, the infiniteness property of unrestricted classical random walks can sometimes be relaxed and properties of classical random walks on finite lines are used instead <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This is indeed the case in the comparison of mixing times for classical and quantum walks on a line. As shown in Eq. (4.20), the hitting time (and therefore its mixing time) of a classical random walk on a line with reflecting barriers is O(t 2 ), where t is the number of steps.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">QUANTUM WALKS ON GRAPHS</head><p>Classical random walks on graphs have been crucial to the development of stochastic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In consequence, quantum walks on graphs has become an active area of research in quantum computation. A gentle introduction to the main ideas about discrete and continuous quantum walks on graphs, as well as to the quantification of resources required for their implementation, is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>. Also, <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> presents numerical simulations of quantum walks in higher dimensions using separable and non-separable coin operators.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>, Aharonov et al. studied several properties of quantum walks on undirected graphs. Motivated by the importance of stationary distributions of Markov Chains (Theorem 8), the quantum counterpart of a stationary distribution is studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>. Their first finding consisted in proving that, if we adopt the classical definition of stationary distribution (Def. <ref type="bibr">4.1.11)</ref>, then quantum walks do not converge to any stationary state nor to any stationary distribution.</p><p>In order to review the contributions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref> and other authors, let us begin by formally introducing the following elements. Let G = (V, E) be a d -regular graph (Def. 4.2.1) with |V | = n. Note that graphs studied in this section are finite, as opposed to the unrestricted line we used in the beginning of this chapter. Let H v be the Hilbert space spanned by states |v where v ∈ V . Also, we define H A , the coin space, as an auxiliary Hilbert space of dimension d spanned by the basis states {|i |i ∈ {1, . . . , d }}, and Ĉ, the coin operator, as a unitary transformation in H A . Finally, label each directed edge with a number between 1 and d so that the directed edges form a permutation (for Cayley graphs the labeling of a directed edge is simply the generator associated with the edge). Now we define a shift operator Ŝ on H v ⊗ H A such that Ŝ|a, v = |a, u , where u is the ath neighbor of v (since edge labeling is a permutation then Ŝ is unitary). Finally, we define one step of the quantum walk on G as Û = Ŝ( Ĉ ⊗ Î ).</p><p>As in the study of quantum walks on a line, if |ψ 0 is the quantum walk initial state then a quantum walk on a graph G can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_176">|ψ t = Û t |ψ 0 .</formula><p>(5.34)</p><p>Before introducing the concept of quantum limiting distribution, we provide an example of a quantum walk on a graph: a discrete quantum walk on a cycle.</p><p>Example. Discrete quantum walk on a cycle. Let G cyc be a cycle with n nodes (see Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.3). A quantum walk on G c acts on a total Hilbert space H 2 ⊗ H n .

(5.36) which were later used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref> for the design of a search algorithm based on a discrete quantum walk (more on this in the following section).</p><p>According to Theorem 11, the speedup that can be provided by a quantum walk on a graph is not enough to exponentially outperform classical walks. So, other parameters of quantum walks have been investigated, among them their hitting time. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>, Kempe offers an analysis of hitting time of discrete quantum walks on the hypercube. Due to the potential service of hitting times in the construction of quantum algorithms, we shall analyze <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref> in detail in Chapter 6 (algorithms based on quantum walks).</p><p>The sub-field of quantum walks on graphs is wide and rich. As a result, there are several interesting works which we have not covered in detail in this lecture due to space restrictions. However, we would like to point out relevant works to the interested reader. We start by mentioning the numerical simulations of quantum walks on graphs shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>, particularly the "localization" phenomenon due to the use of Grover's operator (Eq. (5.2.5)) in a two-dimensional quantum walk. Inspired by this phenomenon, Innui et al. proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref> that the key factor behind this localization phenomenon is the degeneration of the eigenvectors of corresponding evolution operator. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>, Gottlieb et al. studied the convergence of coined quantum walks in R d . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>, Feldman and Hillery have studied the relationship between quantum walks on graphs and scattering theory. Also, López-Acevedo and Gobron <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref> delivered an algebraic oriented analysis of quantum walks on Cayley graphs, Montanaro presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref> a study on quantum walks on directed graphs, Krovi and Brun <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref> have studied quantum walks (and their hitting times) on quotient graphs as well as links between those quantum walks and the group theory properties of Cayley graphs (for an extended work on this last topic, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">MORE CONSIDERATIONS ON CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM WALKS</head><p>The links between classical and quantum versions of random walks have been studied by several authors under different perspectives:</p><p>(1) Some authors, among them Watrous <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref>, have been interested in simulating classical random walks using quantum walks. Studies on this area would provide us not only with interesting computational properties of both types of walks, but also with a deeper insight of the correspondences between the laws that govern computational processes in classical and quantum physical systems.</p><p>(2) Some other authors have studied the properties and conditions of transitions from quantum walks into classical random walks. This area of research is interesting not only for exploring computational properties of both kinds of walks, but also because we would provide quantum computer builders (i.e. experimental physicists and engineers) with some criteria and thresholds for testing the quantumness of a quantum computer. Moreover, these studies have allowed the scientific community to reflect on the quantum nature of quantum walks and some of their implications in algorithm development (in fact, we shall discuss the quantum nature of quantum walks in subsection 5.3.1). For example, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref> that the quantum-classical walk transition could be achieved via two possible methods, in addition to the obvious procedure of performing measurements: decoherence in the quantum coin and the use of higher dimensional coins. Moreover, by using a discrete path approach, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> that introducing a random selection of coins (that is, amplitude components for coin operators are chosen randomly, being under the unitarity constraint) makes quantum walks behave classically. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref>, the authors make use of a family of graphs (e.g. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.2(a)) to exemplify the different behavior of (continuous) quantum walks and classical random walks. Then, several authors have addressed the physical and computational properties of decoherence (i.e. interaction with the environment) in quantum walks: Ermann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref> have inspected the decoherence of quantum walks with a complex coin, where the coin is part of a larger quantum system, and Chandrashekar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref> have studied symmetries and noise effects on coined discrete quantum walks. Then, Kendon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">144]</ref> have extensively studied the computational consequences of coin decoherence in quantum walks. Finally, Alagic and Russell <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref> have studied the effects of independent measurements on a quantum walker traveling along the hypercube, and Košík et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref> have studied the quantum to classical transition of a quantum walk by introducing random phase shifts in the coin particle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Are Quantum Walks Really Quantum?</head><p>The results presented in this chapter show that superposition and, consequently, interference play an important role in the structure and properties of discrete quantum walks. However, interference is also a characteristic of classical physical systems, like electromagnetic waves. Thus, it makes sense to scrutinize whether the statistical and computational properties of quantum walks are really due to their quantum nature or not.</p><p>Arguments in favor of the plausibility of using classical physics for building experiments, which replicate some interference and statistical properties of quantum walks, are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>, where it was shown that it is possible to develop implementations of a quantum walk on a line purely described by classical physics (wave interference of electromagnetic fields) and still be able to reproduce the variance enhancement that characterizes a discrete quantum walk. For example, the implementation proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref> utilizes the frequency of a light field as walker and the spatial path or the polarization state of the same light field as the coin.</p><p>Arguments in favor of the quantum-mechanical nature of quantum walks have been provided by, among others, Kendon and Sanders <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[174]</ref> who showed it would still be necessary to have a quantum-mechanical description of such an implementation in order to account for two properties of a quantum walk: (i) the indivisibility of the quantum walker and (ii) complementarity, which in quantum computation jargon may be stated as follows: the trade-off between interference and information about the path followed by the walker (knowing the path followed by a quantum particle decreases the sharpness of the interference pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">175]</ref>). Furthermore, Romanelli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref> showed that the evolution equation of a quantum walk on a line can be separated into two parts: Markovian and interference terms, and that the quadratic increase in the variance of the quantum walker is a consequence of quantum evolution.</p><p>Thus it seems that if we are only interested in some statistical properties of quantum walks, like its variance enhancement with respect to classical random walks, we could do with either classical or quantum experimental setups. However, the quantum-mechanical nature of walkers and/or coins is essential in the following cases:</p><p>1. From a purely physical point of view, if one is interested in using quantum walks for testing the quantumness of a quantum computer realization, complementarity would be a very helpful resource as it is a property of quantum-mechanical systems that cannot be reproduced in a classical experiment. A similar argument would be applied in the case of using complementary as a computational resource.</p><p>2. Quantum entanglement has been incorporated into quantum walks research either as a result of performing a quantum walk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 7]</ref>) or as a resource to build new kinds of quantum walks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">181]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chs. 6 and 7]</ref>). Since entanglement is a key component in quantum computation, it is worth keeping in mind that quantum walks can be used either as entanglement generators or as computational processes taking advantage of this quantum-mechanical property. Quantum entanglement is produced in quantum walks due to the use of non-local operators operating on two or more qubits. Examples of non-local operators employed in quantum walks can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chs. 6 and 7]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">WHETHER DISCRETE OR CONTINUOUS: IS IT QUANTUM RANDOM WALKS OR JUST QUANTUM WALKS?</head><p>Chance is an inherent component of every single step of a classical random walk. In other words, there is no way to predict step s i of a classical random walk, no matter how much information we have about previous steps s i-1 , s i-2 , . . . , s 1 , s 0 . We can only tell the probability associated with each possible step s j i+1 . On the other hand, if we carefully analyze Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10) as well as all the evolution equations presented in this chapter, we shall convince ourselves of the fact that quantum evolution is deterministic, i.e. for each computational step denoted by |ψ i we can always tell the exact description of step |ψ i+1 , as</p><formula xml:id="formula_182">|ψ i+1 = Û |ψ i .</formula><p>So, what is random about a quantum walk? Why are quantum walks candidates for developing quantum counterparts of stochastic algorithms? The answer is: randomness comes from the measurement processes that have to be performed on either the quantum walker(s) or the quantum coin(s). So, the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement allows us to introduce randomness into a quantum-walk-based algorithm. Moreover, we are not restricted to introducing chance only at the end of the quantum algorithm execution but we can also exploit several measurement strategies in order to manipulate quantum systems and produce probability distributions suitable for their use in advantageous algorithms; for example, see the "top hat" probability distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>, a quasi-uniform distribution created by running a discrete quantum walk and performing measurements on its constituent elements (or, alternatively, allowing such constituent particles to have some interaction with the environment).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">HOW ARE CONTINUOUS AND DISCRETE QUANTUM WALKS CONNECTED?</head><p>The mathematical models of discrete and continuous quantum walks studied in the previous sections present a serious problem: it is not clear at all how to transform discrete quantum walks into continuous quantum walks and vice versa. This is an important issue for two reasons: (1) in the classical case, discrete and continuous random walks are connected via a limit process and (2) it is not natural to have two different kinds of quantum diffusion, one of them with an extra particle (the quantum coin).</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>, Strauch presents a connection between discrete and continuous quantum walks. He starts by using a simplification <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref> of the continuous quantum walk defined by Eq. (5.40), namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_183">Ĥ| j = -γ (| j -1 -2| j + | j + 1 )</formula><p>(5.42)</p><p>QUANTUM WALKS 87</p><p>which in <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> is rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_184">i∂ t ψ(n, t) = -γ (ψ(n + 1, t) -2ψ(n, t) + ψ(n -1, t)) (5.43)</formula><p>where ψ(n, t) is a complex amplitude at the continuous time t and the discrete lattice position n. Then, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> uses results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">112]</ref> to build a discrete quantum walk represented by the following unitary mapping:</p><formula xml:id="formula_185">ψ R (n, τ + 1) = cos θψ R (n -1, τ ) -i sin θψ L (n -1, τ ), (5.44a) ψ L (n, τ + 1) = cos θψ L (n + 1, τ ) -i sin θψ L (n + 1, τ ),<label>(5.44b)</label></formula><p>where ψ R (n, τ ) and ψ L (n, τ ) are complex amplitudes at the discrete time τ and discrete lattice position n.</p><p>Strauch's result focuses on building a unitary transformation Û = exp(-i Ĥt) that allows us to transform Eqs. (5.44a) and (5.44b) into Eq. (5.42). There are several important conclusions from the developments shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>: 1. It is indeed possible to transform a discrete quantum walk into a continuous one by means of a limit process (although this is not a straightforward derivation). 2. Strauch's derivation does not use any coin degree. Thus <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> agrees, from a new perspective, with Patel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> with respect to the irrelevance of the coin degree of freedom in order to obtain the statistical enhancements (σ 2 = O(n)) that discrete quantum walks show. quantum walks and computer science (mainly algorithms) and we strongly recommend the reader to go to the corresponding references for more details.</p><p>This chapter begins with the definition of an oracle, a key element in both classical and quantum algorithms. We then proceed to examine several algorithms based on discrete quantum walks, including an application for simulated annealing. We then provide a summary of algorithmic results based on continuous quantum walks, which include a novel application of continuous quantum walks in quantum chemistry, and finish this chapter by reviewing recent results about the computational universality of quantum walks. Oracles are widely used in classical algorithm design. In the context of quantum computation, we also use oracles to recognize solutions for the search problem. Additionally, we assume that if an oracle recognizes a solution |φ then that oracle is also capable of computing a function with |φ as argument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">ALGORITHMIC APPLICATIONS OF QUANTUM WALKS</head><p>We are interested in searching for M elements in a space of N elements. To do so, we use an index x ∈ S, where S = {0, 1, . . . , N -1}, to enumerate those elements. We also suppose we have a function f : S → {0, 1} such that f (x) = 1 if and only if x is one of the elements we are looking for. Otherwise, f (x) = 0. An oracle can be written as a unitary operator Ô defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_186">Ô(|x |q ) = |x |q ⊕ f (x) , (<label>6.1)</label></formula><p>where |x is the index register, ⊕ is addition modulo 2 (the XOR operation in computer science parlance), and the oracle qubit |q is a single qubit which is flipped if f (x) = 1 and is left unchanged otherwise.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Algorithms Based on Discrete Quantum Walks</head><p>Let us start by introducing the following problem: Definition 6.1.2. Searching in an unordered list. Suppose we have an unordered list of N items labeled x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x N . We want to find one of those elements, say x i .</p><p>Any classical algorithm would take O(N) steps at least to solve the problem given in Def. 6.1.2. However, one of the jewels of quantum computation, Grover's search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, would do much better. By using an oracle and a technique called Amplitude Amplification, the search algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> would only take O( √ N) time steps to solve the same search problem. In addition to its intrinsic value for outperforming classical algorithms, Grover's algorithm has relevant applications in computer science, including solutions to the 3-SAT problem (Def. 3.4.7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>, Shenvi et al. proposed an algorithm based on a discrete quantum walk to solve the search problem given in Def. 6.1.2. For the sake of completeness and in order to present the results contained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>, let us remember the definition of a hypercube. Definition 6.1.3. The hypercube. The hypercube is an undirected graph with 2 n nodes, each of which is labeled by a binary string of n bits. Two nodes x, y in the hypercube are connected by an edge if x, y differ only by a single bit flip, i.e. if | x -y| = 1, where | x -y| is the Hamming distance between x and y. As an example, the three-dimensional hypercube is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6.</ref>1.</p><p>An example of a three-dimensional hypercube can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.1. Since each node of the hypercube has degree n and there are 2 n distinct nodes then the Hilbert space upon which the discrete quantum walk is defined is H = H n ⊗ H 2 n , and each state |ψ ∈ H is described by a bit string x and a direction d . We now define the following coin and shift operators </p><formula xml:id="formula_187">Ĉ = Ĉ0 ⊗ Î = (-Î + 2|s c s c |) ⊗ Î, (<label>6</label></formula><p>where | e d is the d th basis vector of the hypercube. Using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the evolution operator Û = Ŝ Ĉ of the quantum walk on the hypercube <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref> in order to build a slightly modified coin operator C (which works within the algorithm structure as an oracle, Def. 6.1.1) and an evolution operator Û , and by collapsing the hypercube into a line, the quantum walk designed by evolution operator Û is used to search for element x target ∈ {0, 1} n . It is claimed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref> that, after applying Û a number of</p><formula xml:id="formula_189">t f = π 2 √ 2 n = O( √ N)</formula><p>times, the outcome of their algorithm is x target with probability 1  2 -O( 1 n ). A summary of similarities and differences between this quantum walk algorithm and Grover's algorithm can be found in the last few pages of <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>. Also, Gábris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[192]</ref> studied the impact of noise on the algorithmic performance given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>, using a scattering quantum walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref>. Now, let us think of the following problem: we have a hypercube as defined in Def. 6.1.3 and we are interested in measuring the time (or, equivalently, the number of steps) an algorithm would take to go from node i to node j , i.e. its hitting time (Def. 4.2.3). Since defining the notion of hitting time for a quantum walk is not straightforward, <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>  In both cases (Defs. 6.1.4 and 6.1.6), it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref> that the hitting time from one corner to its opposite is polynomial. However, although it was thought that this polynomial hitting time would imply an exponential speedup over corresponding classical algorithms, that is not the case as it is possible to build a polynomial-time classical algorithm to traverse the hypercube from one corner to its opposite <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Further studies on hitting times of quantum walks on graphs can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[194]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[195]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[196]</ref>. A natural step further along employing discrete quantum walks for solving search problems is to use quantum computation techniques to find items stored in spaces of two or more dimensions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[197]</ref>, Benioff proposed the use of Grover's algorithm for searching items in a grid of √ N × √ N elements, and showed that a direct application of such algorithm would take O(N) time steps to find one item, i.e. there would be no more quantum speedup. Later on, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[198]</ref>, Aaronson and Ambainis used Grover's algorithm and multilevel recursion to build algorithms capable of searching in a two-dimensional grid in O( √ N log 2 N) steps and a three-dimensional grid in O( √ N) steps. Moreover, Childs and Goldstone <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[199]</ref> developed a continuous quantum walk algorithm to solve the search problem in a grid and discovered algorithms that would have an optimal performance of O( √ N) in grids of five or more dimensions. Ambainis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[200]</ref> proposed algorithms based on discrete quantum walks (evolution operators used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[200]</ref> are those "perturbed" operators defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>) that would take O( √ N log N) steps to search in a two-dimensional grid and would reach an optimal performance of O( √ N) for three-and higher dimensional grids. An important contribution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[200]</ref> was to show that the performance of search algorithms based on quantum walks is sensitive to the selection of coin operators, i.e. the performance of a search algorithm may be optimal or not depending on the coin operator choice. Finally, Aaronson and Ambainis have shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[201]</ref> how to build algorithms based on discrete quantum walks to search on a two-dimensional grid using a total number of O( √ N log 5/2 N) steps, and a three-dimensional grid with O( √ N) number of steps.</p><p>A variant of Def. 6.1.2, the element distinctness problem, was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202]</ref>.</p><p>Definition 6.1.7.

The second part of the algorithm employs a discrete quantum walk to search graph G. As a result, the algorithm solves the distinctness problem in a total number of O(N 2/3 ) steps and O(N k k+1 ) steps for k identical strings, among N items. Upon the work presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202]</ref>, Magniez et al. proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[203]</ref> a new quantum algorithm for solving the triangle problem, which can be stated as follows.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Algorithms Based on Continuous Quantum Walks</head><p>The operation and mathematical formulation of discrete quantum walks fit very well into the mindset of a computer scientist, as time evolves in discrete steps (as a typical classical algorithm would) and the model employs walkers and coins, usual elements of stochastic processes when employed in algorithm development. However, the most successful applications of quantum walks are found within the realm of continuous quantum walks, as we shall see in this section. Given the seminal result derived by Strauch <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> about the connection between discrete and continuous quantum walks, we now know that results from continuous quantum walks should be translatable, at least in principle, to discrete quantum walks and vice versa.</p><p>Nonetheless, the mathematical structure of continuous quantum walks and the physical meaning of corresponding equations provide an accurate picture of several physical systems upon which we may implement quantum walks and quantum computers. Although most of the physical implementations in this field have been based on the discrete quantum walk model <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[209]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[211]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[212]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[213]</ref>, the additional stimulus provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> as well as the computational universality of quantum walks <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[214]</ref> and recent connections found between quantum walks and adiabatic quantum computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>, another model of continuous quantum computation, it is reasonable to expect new implementations based on continuous quantum walks.</p><p>Consequently, and taking into account that one of the aims of quantum computing is to harness the physical properties of Nature to compute, it is the opinion of this author that computer scientists and students of computer science should become increasingly knowledgeable about the mathematics of continuous systems and their physical interpretation. Introductory references on this matter can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> and, for a more advanced treatment of time-dependent quantum mechanics, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[215]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exponential Algorithmic Speedup by a Quantum Walk</head><p>Farhi and Gutmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref> introduced an algorithm based on a continuous quantum walk, i.e. a quantum walk whose evolution in time is not given in discrete steps, but it rather evolves continuously in time according to the Schrödinger equation (Eq. (2.10)).</p><p>The proposed algorithm solves the following problem: given a graph G s consisting of two balanced binary trees of height n with 2 n leaves of the left tree identified with the 2 n leaves of the right tree according to the way shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.2(a), and with two marked nodes ENTRANCE and EXIT, find an algorithm to go from ENTRANCE to EXIT.</p><p>It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref> that it is possible to build a quantum walk that traverses graph G s from ENTRANCE to EXIT which is exponentially faster than its corresponding classical random walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref>. In other words, the hitting time of the continuous quantum walk proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref> is of polynomial order, while the hitting time of the corresponding classical random walk is of exponential order. However, this advantage does not lead to an exponential speedup due to the fact that it is possible to build a deterministic algorithm that traverses the same graph in polynomial time <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Ideas from <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref> were taken one step further by Childs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where the authors introduced a more general type of graphs G r to be crossed, proved that those graphs could not be passed across efficiently with any classical algorithm, and delivered an algorithm based on a continuous quantum walk that traverses the graph in polynomial time.</p><p>Graphs G r are built as follows. Begin by constructing two balanced binary trees of height n (i.e. with 2 n leaves), but instead of identifying the leaves, they are connected by a random cycle that alternates between the leaves of the two trees, that is, we choose a leaf on the left at random and connect it to a leaf on the right chosen at random too. Then, we connect the latter to a leaf on the left chosen randomly among the remaining ones. The process is continued, always alternating sides, until every leaf on the left is connected to two leaves on the right, and vice versa. See Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.2(b) for an example of graphs G r .</p><p>In order to build the quantum walk that will be used to traverse a graph G r , the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> defined a Hamiltonian Ĥ based on the graph adjacency matrix A (Def. 4.2.1). Ĥ has matrix elements given by a| Ĥ|a = γ, a = a , aa ∈ G r 0, otherwise. (6.5)</p><p>In the continuous quantum walk algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the authors used an oracle to learn about the structure of the graph G r , i.e. information about the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (6.5) is extracted using an oracle. By doing so, it is proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that it is possible to construct a continuous quantum walk that would traverse any graph G r in polynomial time. An improved lower bound for any classical algorithm traversing G r has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[216]</ref>, but the performance difference between quantum and classical algorithms in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> remains exponential.</p><p>Let us present a final reflexion with respect to algorithms purely based on quantum walks, before proceeding to talk about other applications of continuous quantum walks. As rightly argued by Ritcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[217]</ref>, the quantum algorithms reviewed in this chapter are instances of an abstract search problem: given a state space which can be translated into a graph structure, find a marked state (or set of states) by performing a quantum walk on the graph. With this abstraction in mind as well as with the purpose of combining the power of quantum walks with classical sampling algorithms, Ritcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[217]</ref> has proposed a method for almost-uniform sampling based on repeated measurements of a continuous quantum walk.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">UNIVERSALITY OF QUANTUM WALKS</head><p>Universality is a desirable property of a model of computation because it shows that such a model is capable of simulating any other model of computation. Basically, models of computation that are labeled as universal are capable of solving the same problems (although it could happen in different time regimes). The history of quantum computing includes the recollection of significant efforts to prove the universality of several models of quantum computers, i.e. that any algorithm that can be computed by a general-purpose quantum computer <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> can also be executed by quantum gates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, as well as computers based on the quantum adiabatic theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[219]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[220]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[221]</ref>, for example.</p><p>It has recently been proposed that quantum walks are universal models of quantum computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">214]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this lecture we have focused on an emerging field of quantum computation: quantum walks. In order to provide a solid background and to situate this field in an appropriate context, we have produced several introductory chapters covering introductions to the fields of quantum mechanics, the theory of computation, and classical discrete random walks.</p><p>In our chapter on quantum mechanics we have discussed the postulates of quantum mechanics used to study quantum walks and, more generally, the basic concepts of quantum computation. This chapter is meant to be used by computer scientists and other practitioners from scientific and engineering areas interested in a concise presentation of those concepts of quantum mechanics needed to understand our fields.</p><p>As for the theory of computation, we have reviewed the roots of two of the main contributions of Alan Turing to the science of computation: the Church-Turing thesis and Turing machines, together with those elements of the theory of complexity needed to measure the performance of algorithms. These measures are used to quantify the performance of both classical and quantum algorithms. We have also studied the deterministic and nondeterministic models of computation. Finally, we have given a short introduction to the ideas that have enriched the dialogue between physics and computation and provided a formal definition of a Quantum Turing Machine. We have worked on this chapter having in mind not only computer scientists interested in reviewing fundamental elements of computer science, but also physicists looking for a succinct source of information about those basic concepts of the theory of computation needed to start their journey in the study of quantum walks and quantum computation.</p><p>In our chapter on classical random walks we have reviewed the main concepts and theorems used in the application of classical random walks in algorithm development. We have pointed out the fact that if we are to compare the properties of classical and quantum walks on infinite and countable spaces, we need to propose new methods for quantifying performance measures of classical random walks, such as mixing time. Again, we have written this chapter having in mind practitioners of several fields, interested in having a concise source on classical random walks relevant to the study of quantum walks and their algorithmic applications. This is particularly useful because most books on Markov chains are not focused on those elements used in algorithmic development. Finally, we provide a concise introduction to classical continuous random walks.</p><p>In our chapter on quantum walks we present a comprehensive review of the state of the art in discrete and continuous quantum walks. In addition to a careful analysis of quantum walks on a line with Hadamard and arbitrary coin operators, we provide a detailed study of the advantages of the Hadamard quantum walk on the line over its classical counterparts.</p><p>We then proceed to review several concepts and theorems on discrete quantum walks on Cayley graphs. We have shown in this chapter that there are several measures (not necessarily equivalent to each other) used to quantify the performance of quantum walks on graphs. This suggests that there is a clear need to produce better performance definitions in order to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of quantum walks on graphs (not only on Cayley graphs but also any other kind of graph that may be useful in algorithm development).</p><p>The second part of our chapter on quantum walk starts by addressing connections between classical and quantum walks. We then provide a concise presentation of continuous quantum walks, and present some questions about the quantumness of quantum walks. We finish this chapter by focusing on the randomness of quantum walks, the mathematical transformations that connect discrete and continuous quantum walks, and the relevance (or essential need) of using coins in discrete quantum walks.</p><p>The penultimate chapter of this lecture focuses on algorithmic applications of discrete and continuous quantum walk. We present several algorithms based on discrete and continuous quantum walks which have significant advantages over their classical counterparts. In particular, we review an algorithm based on a continuous quantum walk that provides an exponential speedup with respect to its classical counterparts. Then, we present a proposal for the simulation of photosynthetic processes using a generalization of a continuous quantum walk, and finish this chapter with a brief review of the computational universality of quantum walks.</p><p>It is common wisdom among historians that the division of history into periods of time is quite an arbitrary procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">[222,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">223]</ref>. Thus, I would like to state that the division I propose in the following lines is based on my perception of the increasing impact of quantum walks in the scientific community at large.</p><p>The first part of the history of quantum walks is composed of all the seminal works developed by a small core of physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists, who devoted themselves to provide the foundations of our discipline, namely to depict the quantum-mechanical systems whose behavior could be modeled as a walk in a lattice. This era includes the early works of Feynman <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>, Aharonov <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, Meyer <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, Nayak and Vishwanath <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>, as well as the generalizations of quantum walks on graphs and the very first quantum algorithms based on quantum walks presented in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS 103</head><p>In the second and current part of the history of quantum walks, research workers filled the gaps and answered some of the fundamental questions produced during the early years of our discipline. I would say that this second era starts with the very encouraging algorithmic results published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, followed by the connection between discrete and quantum walks delivered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>, the proposals about computational universality of quantum walks <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">214]</ref>, and, finally, the employment of quantum walks in the simulation of quantum phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[218]</ref>.</p><p>A brief study of the past is a good vehicle for designing our future. In my opinion, the future of quantum walks and quantum computing as a whole is very much linked to finding problems of both scientific merit and practical relevance for which quantum algorithms provide better solutions than their classical counterparts, as well as to the successful employment of quantum walks in the simulation of complex physical systems. The mathematical, physical, and computational properties of quantum walks make this field an appealing subject for research workers in order to employ it as a computational tool and/or a physical testbed for scientific discovery. I particularly think of using quantum walks in problems coming from molecular biology and medicine, due to the scientific challenges and the enormous social interest found in those fields.</p><p>However, a disadvantage of quantum walks is the somewhat long time that must be invested in the corresponding learning curve. In order to use quantum walks for both algorithm development and quantum simulation, computer scientists must include an additional "toolbox" in their curricula, namely the fundamental properties of reversible gates, the basic mathematical and physical ideas behind quantum mechanics, and the limitations imposed by physical implementations. However, it is indeed the opinion of this author that the educational investment required to learn the field of quantum walks will prove to be fruitful, as the computer science community will enable itself to harness several properties of Nature for computational purposes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Definition 3 . 4 . 4 .</head><label>344</label><figDesc>Time Complexity Function for a DTM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Science and Quantum Walks</head><p>A key activity in quantum computation is the development of quantum algorithms for solving both classical and quantum problems (this includes simulation of quantum systems). Since classical random walks have been used to develop successful stochastic algorithms, there has been a huge interest in understanding the computational properties of quantum walks over the last few years. A general strategy for building an algorithm based on quantum walks includes choosing (1) the unitary operators (Eq. (2.9)), for discrete quantum walks, or the Hamiltonians (Eq. (2.10)), for continuous quantum walks, that will be employed to determine the time evolution of the quantum hardware and (2) the measurement operators that will be employed to find out the position of the walker (Eq. (2.11)).</p><p>The quantum programmer must bear in mind that the choice of evolution and measurement operators, as well as initial quantum states, will determine the shape and other properties of the resulting probability distribution for the quantum walker. Moreover, a computer scientist interested in algorithms based on quantum walks must keep in mind that making copies of arbitrary quantum states is not possible in general due to the no-cloning theorem (subsection 2.2.3) thus copying variable content is not allowed in principle. Indeed, it is possible to use cloning machines for imperfect quantum state copying, but it would frequently translate into computational and estimation errors. Since any non-reversible gate can be converted into a reversible gate <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">188]</ref>, errors due to imperfect quantum state cloning are unnecessary and consequently must be avoided. Employing classical computer simulators of quantum walks <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[189,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">190]</ref> can be a fruitful exercise in order to figure out the operators and initial states required for algorithmic applications of quantum walks.</p><p>Quantum algorithms based on either discrete or continuous quantum walks are built upon detailed and complex mathematical structures and it is not possible to cover all details in a single chapter. Therefore, we shall devote this chapter to review the fundamental links between Author Biography Salvador E. Venegas-Andraca is an assistant professor of mathematics and computer science, and head of the Quantum Information Processing group at Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Estado de Mexico. Dr Venegas-Andraca's research interests include the algorithmic properties of quantum walks, the development of quantum algorithms for solving classical problems and simulating quantum systems, as well as the understanding and application of non-conventional models of computation.</p><p>Dr Venegas-Andraca is particularly interested in understanding how to develop quantum and classical strategies for solving problems from the field of molecular biology, particularly protein folding.</p><p>Dr Venegas-Andraca holds a BSc in Computer Science and Digital Electronics from Tecnologico de Monterrey, as well as MSc and PhD degrees in Computer Science and Quantum Computation respectively, both degrees from the University of Oxford. He is a true devotee of science, computer technology, history, philosophy and politics.
