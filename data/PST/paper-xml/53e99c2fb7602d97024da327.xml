<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE problem of fault detection and isolation in dynam- ical systems is the problem of generating diagnostic signals sensitive to the occurrence of faults. Regarding a fault as an input acting on the system, a diagnostic signal must be able to "detect" its occurrence, as well as to "isolate" this particular input from all other inputs (disturbances, other faults) affecting the system behavior. One specific diagnostic signal (also called residual) must be generated per each fault to be detected, each diagnostic signal being sensitive only to one particular fault. Set in these terms, the problem of fault detection and isolation has very much the connotation of a problem of designing a system which, processing all available information about the plant, yields a "noninteractive" map between faults (viewed as inputs) and residuals (viewed as outputs).</p><p>This problem has attracted a good deal of attention, since its formulation in these terms by Beard <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Jones <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The original work of these authors addresses the problem in a fashion that corresponds to the solution of the dual version of a problem of noninteracting control by means of memoryless feedback. Later, Massoumnia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have shown that the problem can be addressed and successfully solved in a more general setting, which turns out to correspond to the solution of the dual version of a problem of noninteracting control by means of dynamic feedback. In this way, a number of obstructions inherent in the Beard-Jones approach, namely the necessity of a vector relative degree and the stability of certain fixed modes were removed (see Section II).</p><p>The core of the Beard-Jones fault detection filter is a Luenberger observer, designed in such a way that the resulting "error" system, in which the faults are viewed as inputs and the residuals are viewed as outputs, has a diagonal (and nontrivial) stable transfer function matrix. This "observer-based" approach to the problem of residual generation was later pursued by several authors seeking extensions to more general classes of systems (as Seliger and Frank <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>), surveyed, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The most important issue of detecting and isolating faults in the presence of noise-corrupted measurements has been thoroughly investigated, in a framework corresponding to that considered by Beard and Jones in the noise-free case, by Speyer and coauthors in a series of recent papers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>).</p><p>In this paper, we approach the problem of fault detection and isolation for nonlinear systems, at a same level of generality as in Massoumnia et al. In essence, these authors have proven that a basic necessary and sufficient condition for the problem to be solvable is the existence of an unobservability subspace (a subspace that can be rendered "unobservable" via "output-injection" and "output-reduction") leading to a quotient (observable) subsystem unaffected by all fault signals but one. The subspace in question can be determined in a straightforward manner, from the parameters that characterize the plant, by means of simple recursive algorithms which were introduced earlier in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to a similar purpose (disturbance decoupling, with internal stability, via measurement feedback) and which dualize those introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for noninteracting control, with internal stability, via dynamic state feedback. Once this subspace has been determined, if the test of the necessary and sufficient condition is passed, the simple construction of an asymptotic observer for the quotient subsystem above yields the desired filter.</p><p>A very similar program is carried out, for the case of nonlinear systems, in this paper. Looking at dual versions of the objects introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>) to solve the problem of noninteracting control for nonlinear systems, we approach here the problem of fault detection and isolation in differential geometric terms and we show that a solution to this problem can be characterized in terms of properties of certain distributions, which can be considered as the nonlinear analog of the unobservability subspaces. As in the case of linear systems, it is shown (Section IV) that the problem is solvable only if one of such distributions exists leading to a quotient system which is unaffected by all fault signals but one. Unobservability distributions (recently introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and reviewed here in Sec-tion III) can be computed by means of algorithms that extend to nonlinear systems those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Conversely, it is also shown (Section V) that if such a distribution exists, it is possible to perform changes of coordinates in the state and in the output spaces which highlight a special internal structure and in particular the existence of a locally weakly observable subsystem, which is not affected by all fault signals but one. Once these changes of coordinates have been performed, the problem of designing a fault detection filter can be reduced to the design of an observer for the quotient subsystem. As it is well known, the local weak observability does not help in general to the construction of an observer. Motivated by this, we consider a suitable stronger property of observability introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and design a fault detection filter accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. A GEOMETRIC APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF FAULT DETECTION AND ISOLATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Preliminaries</head><p>We assume throughout the paper that the reader is familiar with the basic differential-geometric methods for the analysis and design of nonlinear control systems (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). We consider systems modeled by equations of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with state defined in a neighborhood of the origin in , inputs , , and output , in which , the columns of , and the columns of are smooth vector fields, is a smooth mapping and , . The three sets of components of the input of (1) correspond, respectively, to an input channel to be used for control purposes, to a fault signal whose occurrence has to be "detected," and to a disturbance signal , whose components include actual disturbances as well as other fault signals from which the specific fault has to be "isolated." The main problem addressed in this paper is the design of a filter (which is throughout referred to as the "residual generator"), modeled by equations of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> with state defined in a neighborhood of the origin in , inputs and output , with , in which and the columns of are smooth vector fields, is a smooth mapping, and , , such that the response of the cascaded system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> depends "nontrivially" on (i.e., is affected by) the input , depends "trivially" on (i.e., is decoupled from) the input and asymptotically converges to zero whenever is identically zero, no matter what is.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Fundamental Problem of Residual Generation</head><p>In order to address the design problem outlined in the previous section, it is appropriate to recall first how the property that the output of a nonlinear system is "affected by" or "decoupled from" a fixed set of inputs can be expressed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>). Consider a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> in which is defined in a neighborhood of the origin in , are smooth vector fields and is a smooth function. Let denote the smallest codistribution invariant under which contains (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 1.9]</ref>). It can be shown (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 3.3]</ref>) that the output of ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is decoupled from the input if [and, of course, that of ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is affected by the input if ].</p><p>Taking this characterization as point of departure, let</p><p>denote the system (3), resulting from the composition of the plant (1) and the filter (2), in which for for Moreover, let denote the smallest codistribution which contains and is invariant under all , , and all , . In view of the above discussion, it can be asserted that the output of (5) depends nontrivially on the input if and depends trivially on the input when if for <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> Motivated by this, we address in the paper the following design problem.</p><p>Problem: Given system (1), find, if possible, an integer and a residual generator (2) such that, in the cascade (5), the codistribution satisfies i) ; ii) ; iii) there is such that, if , then</p><p>Henceforth, we denote this problem as nonlinear fundamental problem of residual generation ( NLFPRG, where " " underlines the fact that the fault detection and isolation features are required to hold only locally) and improperly refer to requirement iii) as the stability requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Isolation of Concurrent Faults</head><p>The formulation of the NLFPRG just given lends itself to the possibility of designing a filter for the purpose of detecting as well as isolating multiple concurrent faults , in the case of a system of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> To this end, set, for and rewrite system (7) as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> Suppose that the residual generator <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> solves the NLFPRG for system (8), i.e., it is a residual generator with respect to the fault . Then, it is immediately shown that the bank of residual generators <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> solves the problem of detecting and isolating each individual fault signal . Conversely, if there is a residual generator of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> such that, in the cascaded system ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, for each , the residual is affected by the input and decoupled from the inputs and and asymptotically convergent to zero as is identically zero, then necessarily the filter solves the NLFPRG for <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>Remark: It is worth stressing that this manner of approaching the problem of detection and isolation of multiple faults, originally suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in the case of linear systems, is substantially more general than the approach suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In fact, for a linear system of the form the so-called Beard-Jones approach to fault detection and isolation seeks a filter of the form with and such that in the "error system" the transfer function between and is purely diagonal, the transfer function between and is zero, and is Hurwitz.</p><p>The reader familiar with the theory of noninteracting control (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>) will easily recognize that determining a filter with this property is equivalent to solving a problem of noninteracting control via memoryless feedback, while determining a filter in the way indicated at the beginning (i.e., "stacking" together a set of filters each of which solves an FPRG for each individual fault signal) is equivalent to solving a problem of noninteracting control via dynamic feedback. The solvability of the former problem has severe obstructions, such as the requirement of "vector relative degree" and the stability of certain "fixed modes," while the solvability of the latter problem only requires the transfer function between and to be "left-invertible," which is a condition generically satisfied if the number of the components of is larger than or equal to the number of components of .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE OBSERVABILITY CODISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR PROPERTIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Introduction</head><p>In linear system theory, the concept of "complementary observability subspace" (or, in the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, of "unobservability subspace"), which is the dual of the concept of "controllability subspace," plays an important role in a number of important issues related to the design of filters for the observation of certain states in the presence of unknown (deterministic) disturbances. This concept, introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to tackle problems of disturbance decoupling via output measurements with pole placement, was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to solve the fundamental problem of residual generation for linear systems (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>).</p><p>It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> that the existence of a solution of the FPRG for <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> depends on a simple relation between the subspace and the "minimal unobservability subspace" which contains the subspace . Definition and properties of the unobservability subspaces are easily derived by duality from the corresponding notion and properties of the controllability subspaces, for which the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Specifically, dualizing definition 5.1.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a subspace is said to be an unobservability subspace of the pair if there exist matrices and such that is the set of unobservable states of the system</p><p>The set of all unobservability subspaces containing a given subspace is closed with respect to subspace intersection, from which it results that this set has a unique minimal element, denoted , which can be determined in a finite number of stages by means of standard algorithms that dualize those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 5]</ref> for the computation of the largest controllability subspace contained in a given subspace . The algorithms in question involve, at each stage, only elementary linear-algebraic manipulations such as subspace additions and intersections.</p><p>The subspace plays a crucial role in the solution of the problem outlined above, as shown in the following fundamental, yet very expressive, result proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 1: Consider the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. There exists a solution of the FPRG if and only if . It must be stressed that the proof of the sufficiency part of this theorem can be put in a constructive form, i.e., lends itself to the design of a filter that solves the problem in question. This can be easily seen as a special case of the general nonlinear results derived in this paper, which provide as a byproduct an alternative proof of Theorem 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Conditioned Invariant Distributions</head><p>In this and the following section, we review some properties of the notions that provide the extension, to nonlinear systems, of the concept of "complementary observability subspace."</p><p>These notions have been recently introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, to which the reader is referred for further information, and are summarized here along with their most fundamental features. Consider a nonlinear system of the form (4). We recall that a distribution is said to be conditioned invariant (or, invariant, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) for (4) if it satisfies for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where, for convenience, we have set , and is the distribution annihilating the differentials of the rows of the mapping . Let now be a set of additional smooth vector fields, set and consider the nondecreasing sequence of distributions defined as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where denotes the involutive closure of . Then, the following holds (see <ref type="bibr">[14, p. 341</ref>] and [13, Lemma 6.3.1]).</p><p>Lemma 1: Suppose there exists an integer such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> and set Then is involutive, contains and is conditioned invariant. Moreover, any other distribution which is involutive, contains and is conditioned invariant satisfies . Remark: A codistribution is said to be conditioned invariant if for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where is the codistribution spanned by the differentials of the rows of the mapping . As shown in [14, p. 341], if is a smooth distribution and is a smooth codistribution, then satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. If is well-defined [i.e., condition (15) holds for some ] and nonsingular, and is a smooth distribution, it can be asserted that is the maximal conditioned invariant codistribution which is locally spanned by exact differentials and contained in .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Observability Codistribution Algorithm and Its Properties</head><p>Consider again system (4), let be a fixed codistribution and define the following nondecreasing sequence of codistributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> Suppose that all codistributions of this sequence are nonsingular, so that there is an integer such that for all , and set It is convenient to use the notation o.c.a.</p><p>(where "o.c.a." stands for "observability codistribution algorithm") to stress the dependence on of the codistribution , at which the algorithm (17) has stopped. Then, the following properties hold (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). Proposition 1: Suppose all codistributions generated by the algorithm ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) are nonsingular and let o.c.a. be defined as above. Then <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> As a consequence o.c.a.</p><p>.

THE NECESSITY The purpose of this section is to prove that, if the NLFPRG has a solution, and an additional technical hypothesis holds, then o.c.a. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> which is the nonlinear (and dual) version of the fundamental property identified in Theorem 1 as necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of the FPRG for a linear system.</p><p>Given a set of smooth vector fields, and a smooth map let (see [13, Sec. 1.9]) denote the smallest smooth codistribution invariant with respect to and containing . Recall that the codistribution in question can be determined by means of the nondecreasing sequence of smooth codistributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> In fact, if is nonsingular, then Moreover, is locally spanned by exact differentials.</p><p>We prove first a general property, which is the nonlinear version of a property that trivially holds in the case of linear systems [namely the property that if is an unobservability subspace of , then is also an unobservability subspace of if ], but whose proof in the case of nonlinear systems requires a little work, in view of the more elaborate definition of observability codistribution.</p><p>Lemma 2: Let be a set of smooth vector fields, let be a smooth map, suppose the distribution defined above is nonsingular, and set . Let be another smooth map, satisfying and suppose is a smooth codistribution. Consider the nondecreasing sequence of codistributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> Then, for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(24)</formula><p>As a consequence, is an observability codistribution for the system By construction, and therefore ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) trivially holds. To prove <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, we show that, in the sequence ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>), one has (28) and this, in view of (27) will prove the claim.</p><p>To this end, consider again the sequences of codistributions ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) and observe that, by definition Suppose for some . Then where, in the last passage, we have the properties that and . Thus, (28) holds. To conclude the proof of the Lemma it suffices to observe that, if <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> holds, all codistributions of the sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> with coincide with . In other words, the observability codistribution algorithm for <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, initialized at , converges to .</p><p>Suppose now that the NLFPRG for (1) is solved by some filter (2) and consider the cascade plant/filter (3), rewritten in the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Set also Define the nondecreasing sequence of codistributions and recall (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 1.9]</ref>) that, if is nonsingular, then i.e., is the smallest codistribution which contains and is invariant under for all . Set and note that this codistribution, if nonsingular, is locally spanned by exact differentials.</p><p>Specializing Lemma 2 to the case of the cascade plant/filter, we obtain the following.</p><p>Proposition 3: Suppose the distribution defined above is nonsingular and set . Suppose is a smooth codistribution. Then, is an observability codistribution for the system (29) Proof: It immediately follows from the Lemma 2 and from the fact that . By definition, the distribution thus defined and the distribution considered in the formulation of the NLFPRG are such that We deduce from this that, if the filter (2) solves the problem, necessarily for all If is involutive, this property shows that is automatically invariant under all 's, and therefore that and coincide.</p><p>As a consequence, we see that if the filter (2) solves the problem and is nonsingular, we necessarily have Now, we show the implications of these properties on the system (1). This will be done under the following hypothesis.</p><p>Assumption I: The codistribution is nonsingular. Moreover, for each , there are smooth covector fields of the form (30) which span at any in a neighborhood of . Observe that , which are smooth covector fields defined on a neighborhood , define on a smooth codistribution as follows:</p><p>The codistribution defined in this way has a number of properties that help determine a necessary condition for the solution of the problem in question.</p><p>Proposition 4: The following properties hold: i</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">) ; ii) ; iii) is involutive; iv)</formula><p>, for all . If all the codistributions of the sequence generated by the observability codistribution algorithm for (29), initialized at , are nonsingular and all the codistributions of the sequence generated by the observability codistribution algorithm for (31) initialized at , are nonsingular, then v) the observability codistribution algorithm for (31), initialized at , converges to . Thus, is an observability codistribution for the system (31). Proof: By hypothesis, annihilates all covectors of and, in particular, all covectors of (30). In view of the special form of , this yields for all and proves i). Similarly, since by hypothesis cannot annihilate all covectors of (30), cannot annihilate all the 's and this proves ii). To prove iii), take two vector fields and set Indeed, , and so is because is involutive. Thus, also . To prove iv), take the derivative of any covector in <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>  For, suppose this is true at step , namely that is spanned by the rows of a matrix in which the rows of span . The derivative along of any of the rows of this matrix is a covector of the form [compare with (32)] in which, by construction, is a covector in , while the second addend in the right-hand side is a covector in . Therefore, we see that is spanned by the rows of a matrix of the form in which the rows of span . From this, an argument identical to the one used before for shows that is spanned by vectors of the form in which the 's span . By hypothesis, . The arguments above show that is spanned by the rows of a matrix of the form in which the rows of span . Thus, by definition of , we see that and this proves v).</p><p>This Proposition shows (under appropriate technical hypotheses) that, if the NLFPRG has a solution, there is an observability codistribution, namely , which is locally spanned by exact differentials and satisfies properties i) and ii). Now, suppose that the hypotheses under which Proposition 2 is valid hold. Then, using property i), it is seen that by definition is contained in the maximal observability codistribution which is locally spanned by exact differentials and contained in Remark: Note that the technical hypotheses used to derive the condition in question are trivially satisfied in the case of a linear system (with linear residual generator). Thus, the result proven in this section contains as a particular case the necessity part of Theorem 1.</p></div>

As a matter of fact, the -subsystem of (38), in which can be identified with (which of course is possible by virtue the special choice of the new coordinates) and viewed as an "independent input," namely system (40) can be shown, under a convenient additional assumption, to be locally weakly observable, in the sense of the classical definition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>To this end, suppose that the hypotheses of Proposition 5 hold and (locally) change coordinates, in the state and output spaces, as described in this Proposition. This yields a system, of the form (4), in which, for , and where . Define, for and set so that Assumption II: For every vector field and every covector field , . Remark: Note that this assumption is trivially satisfied when is independent of [i.e., when is the sum of a function of and a function of ]. In fact, in this case, since the vector field is trivially zero. In particular, the assumption is satisfied if the s are linear vector fields. Then, the following holds.</p><p>Proposition 6: Consider system (4). Let be an observability codistribution satisfying the hypotheses of Proposition 5 and choose a change of coordinates yielding the special form (38). Suppose also that the Assumption II above is satisfied. Then, the subsystem (41) is locally weakly observable.</p><p>Proof: See <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Remark: We recall (see again <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) that the property of local weak observability implies that any point in the state space can be distinguished from any other point in a neighborhood, in the standard sense of state distinguishability (two states are distinguishable if they induce different input-output maps). Thus, if such a property holds for (41), it indeed holds a fortiori for the subsystem (42) viewed as a system with inputs and output . The result derived above carries very useful consequences for the solution of the problem of residual generation. To see why this is the case, consider a system of the form (1), determine the codistribution o.c.a.</p><p>, which, as shown before in Proposition 2, is the largest observability codistribution locally spanned by exact differentials and contained in , and suppose the condition o.c.a.</p><p>(43) of which we have shown the necessity in the previous section, holds [note, trivially, that the maximality of o.c.a. maximizes the chances of having (43) fulfilled]. Then, just changing the coordinates in the way described above, we see that the first set of output variables is actually the output of a system of the form which turns out to be locally weakly observable (viewing and as inputs) and in which the vector field is by assumption nonzero. Hence, the occurrence of a fault can be detected by appropriately processing the signals , , and .</p><p>For example, in case system (1) is a linear system, if (compare with Theorem 1) the decomposition described above yields <ref type="bibr">(44)</ref> in which and the pair is observable. To design a residual generator, set <ref type="bibr">(45)</ref> with such that the eigenvalues of have negative real part. A trivial calculation, based on the observation that the difference satisfies shows that (45) solves the fundamental problem of residual generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Example: Actuator Fault Detection for a Point-Mass Satellite Model</head><p>As a simple application of the techniques illustrated in the latter subsection, we want to design a detection filter for revealing the occurrence of a fault on the tangential thrust in a point-mass planar model of a satellite. The model in question is provided by the following set of differential equations (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) in which denotes the position of the satellite in polar coordinates on the plane, is the radial velocity, is the angular velocity and are the radial and, respectively, tangential thrust, is the fault signal (note, for instance, that models a total failure of the tangential thrust) and represents the disturbance signal. The parameters are supposed to be known, constant and different from zero. Note that the disturbance can make the detection of the fault more difficult due to the presence of the coupling term in the equation of the angular acceleration . The following quantities are assumed to be available for measurements:</p><p>In this example, the disturbance vector field is represented by the vector Using the algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, the minimal conditioned invariant distribution containing is found to be Note that is smooth, nonsingular and involutive for any .

Moreover, a disturbance signal is present [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1(b)</ref>]. From the observed variables [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1(d)-(f)</ref>] no hint on the occurrence of the fault can be obtained.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Design of Filters for Fault Detection</head><p>To conclude the paper, we show in this section how to exploit the decomposition described in Section V-A for the purpose of designing a residual generator in the case of a nonlinear system. For the sake of simplicity, we consider the case in which is one-dimensional. Extension to the case in which is a vector requires appropriate modification of the Assumption III below. Motivated by the previous discussion, we focus our attention on the system (49) viewed as a system with inputs and output and we address the issue of designing an asymptotic observer for . We have already shown that, under mild hypotheses, such a system is guaranteed to be locally weakly observable by construction, but we also know that this property may not suffice to the purposes of designing an asymptotic observer. To this end, a stronger observability property, introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10</ref> It can be shown (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) that, for any choice of , there exist functions (51) with the following properties: i) agrees with and, for each , agrees with on the compact set ii) each of the functions , , is globally Lipschitz with respect to , uniformly in ; iii) there exist real numbers , such that</p><p>Let now be any pair of positive numbers and let be such that the condition in Assumption IV holds. Accordingly, fix the functions (51) and consider the system (52) Clearly, if and , the state responses of (50) and of (52) agree for all . Hence, to observe the state of (50) is the same thing as to observe the state of (52).</p><p>Motivated by the results of Gauthier-Kupca <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we consider a residual generator of the form (53) in which is a (sufficiently large) positive number and are numbers depending on the parameters and in condition iii) above, determined according to the following result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 3: Consider the pair of matrices and suppose that, for some pair of real numbers , , Then, there exist a vector and a symmetric positive-definite matrix satisfying</p><p>The following fundamental result, due to Gauthier-Kupca <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, shows that the state of system (53) globally exponentially tracks the state of system (52).</p><p>Theorem 2: For any there is (large enough) such that, for all pairs , the responses of (52) with initial condition and of (53) with initial condition satisfy for some polynomial function of degree . From this, it is immediate to conclude that system (53) is a residual generator for system (49).</p><p>Corollary 1: Consider system (49). For any pair there is a residual generator of the form (53) and a number (large enough) such that if , , and for all , then . The "sensitivity" of the residual generated by the filter (53) with respect to the fault is a straightforward consequence of the observability property of the -subsystem and of the property that the fault vector field is not identically zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have studied the problem of fault detection and isolation for nonlinear systems. Starting with a geometric characterization of the problem, we have derived under a mild hypothesis a basic necessary condition, which is expressed in terms of unobservability distributions. The fulfillment of this condition implies the existence of diffeomorphisms in the output space and the state space which highlight a special internal structure, particularly suitable for designing a residual generator which solves the problem of fault detection. The most significant feature of this structure is the existence of a disturbance-decoupled and "observable" subsystem which is affected by the fault. In the case of linear systems, this immediately leads to a solution of the problem, since for such a subsystem a standard observer can be used as a residual generator. In the case of nonlinear systems, the subsystem in question is guaranteed to be locally weakly observable. If it is also "completely uniformly observable," using some recent results from the theory of nonlinear observers, we have been able to construct an observer which plays the role of a residual generator. The extension to the case of multiple concurrent faults, although straightforward, has been briefly discussed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>5.3]), we say that a codistribution is an observability codistribution for (4) if for all o.c.a.(19)Built in this definition is the implicit requirement that all codistributions of the sequence that defines o.c.a. are nonsingular. Likewise, we may say that is an unobservability distribution if its annihilator is an observability codistribution. Proposition 1 says that, if is a conditioned invariant distribution, then o.c.a.is an observability codistribution. If the algorithm (17) is initialized at , then o.c.a. is by construction an observability codistribution contained in . As a matter of fact, it can be readily seen that o.c.a. is the largest codistribution having such property.Proposition 2: The codistribution o.c.a. is the maximal (in the sense of codistribution inclusion) observability codistribution contained in . Suppose that the distribution is well-defined [i.e., condition (15) holds for some ] and nonsingular, and that is a smooth distribution. Then, o.c.a.</figDesc></figure>
