<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asymptotic Regulation of Minimum Phase</head><p>Nonlinear Svstems Using Output Feedback Nazmi A. Mahmoud, Member, IEEE, Abstract-We consider a single-inputlsingle-output (SISO) nonlinear system which has a well-defined normal form with asymptotically stable zero dynamics. We allow the system's equation to depend on constant uncertain parameters and disturbance inputs which do not change the relative degree. Our goal is to design an output feedback controller which regulates the output to a constant reference. The integral of the regulation error is augmented to the system equation, and a robust output feedback controller is designed to bring the state of the closed-loop system to a positively invariant set. Once inside this set, the trajectories approach a unique equilibrium point at which the regulation error is zero. We give regional as well as semiglobal results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>NE of the important problems in control systems is the servomechanism problem; that is, to get the plant output to asymptotically track a reference while asymptotically rejecting disturbances, when both the reference and disturbance signals satisfy a given differential equation model. For linear systems, this problem was extensively studied by many researchers; see for example <ref type="bibr">Davison [5]</ref> and Davison and Ferguson 161. A self-contained exposition is found in Desoer and Wang <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>; a different approach to the solution of this problem was presented by Francis [ I l l . Since our focus in this work is on nonlinear systems, we highlight some of the previous contributions to the solution of this problem. In [3] Desoer and Wang studied this problem for a class of nonlinear distributed systems where the nonlinearity appears as causal operators at the input and output channels of a linear system. Desoer and Lin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> studied this problem using PI controllers for exponentially stable plants having a strictly increasing dc steady-state input-output map with references and disturbances tending to constant vectors. Isidori and Byrnes [ 161 provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the local solution of the problem for a general case where the disturbance and reference signals can be timevarying but small, and initial states were required to be small. Huang and Rugh [13], [14], using the method of extended linearization, designed dynamic output feedback controllers for the solution of this problem. In <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> they considered the case of sufficiently small constant or slowly varying external techniques to solve this problem globally for a class of systems that is characterized by geometric conditions where the zero dynamics are restricted, in suitable coordinates, to be linear.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> Khalil studied a special case of this problem for a class of single-input/single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems with relative degree T = n that admit a disturbance-strictfeedback form, but he allowed time-varying disturbances and reference signals. For feedback linearizable systems, robust continuous feedback control laws can be designed to ensure convergence of the tracking error to a small ball while rejecting bounded disturbances. However, making the error arbitrarily small requires the use of high-gain feedback near the origin; see for example [l], <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>.</p><p>In this work we use integral control to ensure asymptotic regulation, in the case of constant references, for a SISO minimum phase nonlinear system that is transformable into the normal form uniformly in a set of constant disturbances and uncertain parameters. The introduction of the integrator creates an equilibrium point at which the tracking error is zero for all possible parameters and/or disturbances that belong to a known compact set. We provide estimates of the region of attraction that are limited only by the region of validity of our model. If the domain becomes global, these estimates can be made arbitrarily large. Consequently, we have a semiglobal result. We do not impose global linear growth conditions on the nonlinearities, nor do we require global exponential stability of the zero dynamics.</p><p>To recover the asymptotic properties achieved under state feedback, we saturate the state feedback control over a compact set of interest then implement this globally bounded control as an observer-based controller using a linear high-gain observer.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows: The class of systems is presented in Section 11. In Section 111, asymptotic regulation is achieved under state feedback. In Section IV, output feedback is used to recover the robustness and asymptotic regulation 0018-9286/96$05.00 0 1996 IEEE A = properties of the state feedback controller. The main result of this section is Theorem I . In Section V, we present the semiglobal result. Finally, some concluding remarks are given in Section VI. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E = f(E, 0) + dE, Q)u Y = h(E, 8 ) (1)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[ E R" is the state, U E R is the control input, y E R</formula><p>is the measured output, and 6' is a vector of unknown constant parameters and disturbance inputs which belong to a compact set 0 c R'.

With this in mind, we assume the following about <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(1)</ref>.</p><p>Assumption 1: VI/ E r and W E 8 , there exist an equilibrium point [o(v, 8 ) and a control u(v, e) such that 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= f(Eo(v, 0 ) ) 0) + .dlo(v, 0),0)u(7/, 8 ) = h(lo(v, 01, 0).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Moreover, Eo(v,Q) is the only such equilibrium point in U*.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.x1</head><p>Conditions under which Assumption 2 holds locally or globally, when 6' = 80 (known), are given in [2, Proposition 3.2b, Corollary 5.61. Global conditions are also given in <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref> Corollary 5.71 for the case when 4 = ~( I C I , 2). We point out here that in contrast to a local or a global diffeomorphism, the mapping (3) is required to be a diffeomorphism of a domain U0 onto its image. A result of <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref> gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a smooth mapping that maps U into V to be a diffeomorphism of U onto V. A smooth mapping F : ZJ + F ( U ) is a diffeomorphism of l J onto its image if and only if a) det Jc # 0 throughout U and b) F is a proper map of U into F ( U ) , where Jc denotes the Jacobian matrix o f F at a general point 5 E U. At this juncture, we recognize that there are no results available in the literature that will guarantee the existence of the mapping T for a given domain U*. Usually one starts from local conditions and in the process of transforming the system into the normal form (5) a region over which the normal form holds is identified. Requiring the normal form ( 5 ) to hold uniformly in B is clearly more restrictive than requiring it to hold for a given value of 8. For many examples of physical systems which are transformable into the normal form, it is indeed true that the normal form holds uniformly in the system parameters, at least over a compact set of these parameters; see for example the fieldcontrolled DC motor and the robot arm examples of [15, Sec. 4.101. There is also the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> which characterizes a class of systems for which such representation is valid.

For semiglobal results, to be considered in Section V, Assumption 4 must hold globally.

In light of a recent result of [33], this assumption is also necessary for the system to be ISS. However, for regional results it becomes less restrictive.

This is not a reasonable assumption because of the dependence of the transformation (3) on the unknown parameter B. However, the final controller will be an observer-based controller, and no measurement of the state will be used. For feedback linearizable systems where the uncertain terms 6, 91 satisfy the matching condition, several methods are available to design robust state feedback controls such as min-max, high gain, and variable structure control. In this work we chose to use the min-max controller of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, but other methods could have been used as well.</p><p>We start the design procedure by choosing K such that (A+ B K ) is Hurwitz.

We note also that p is not allowed to depend on z even though the left-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) is a function of z . This is a built-in conservative measure of our design which is adopted to allow the use of the partial state feedback independent of z . Inequality (24) is a sign definiteness requirement on 91 that is sometimes referred to in the literature as the high-frequency gain assumption <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. Continuing the design procedure, we consider the following partial state feedback control <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">= P(C,<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where ~(5) 2 p(&lt;) will be chosen later s = 2BT1'{: and p is a design parameter whose role will be discussed soon.</p><p>As it was emphasized in [351, handling local convergence to the equilibrium point separate from showing boundedness of solutions has some advantages, as certain assumptions on the nonlinearities of the system are required to hold only locally on a small set around that equilibrium point. Then, if we force the trajectories, using nonlinear or high-gain control, to enter in finite time a positively invariant set that is in the interior of the set of validity of our local assumptions, we can utilize these assumptions in the local analysis to show convergence to the equilibrium point. Control <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> achieves this task by using the nonlinear term -(l/kgo)vNF! which is preferable to using a high-gain term that results in a larger control effort far from the origin. In light of this discussion, our immediate task is to perform regional analysis to show boundedness of solutions.</p><p>We first show, using Lyapunov techniques, that the state (&lt;, z )</p><p>will enter and thereafter remain inside a positively invariant set around ( 0 , ~' ) which can be made arbitrarily small. Thus, if the system has an equilibrium point it has to be inside this residual set.

We turn now to the behavior of the trajectory inside 72,.

Our approach to that end is to force the state ( to enter and thereafter remain inside the boundary layer (~/(&lt;)jsl 5 p } and to have the nonlinear term 77(&lt;)NLL(s, 77(()) reduce to a linear function of s inside this boundary layer.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The basic idea of this work is the use of integral control to achieve asymptotic regulation and disturbance rejection for constant references and disturbances. By introducing the integrator we create an equilibrium point at which the tracking error is zero, since the integrator is driven by the tracking error. The main task of the controller after that is to stabilize the equilibrium point which is a challenging task because the equilibrium point depends on the unknown parameter H. This is not an issue in linear servomechanism where stabilizing the equilibrium point does not require knowledge of that point. There it is merely stabilization of a matrix which represents the homogeneous part of the closed-loop system. If we were interested in local results that would hold only Ior sufficiently small initial states and external signals, the stabilization problem for the nonlinear servomechanism would reduce to stabilization of a matrix. It is the desire to obtain regional and semiglobal results that makes this stabilization problem a challenging one. Our approach to stabilize this unknown equilibrium point is to use a nonlinear robust controller to drive the trajectories toward the point (&lt;&gt;,z) = ( 0 , ~' ) . As far as that nonlinear controller is concerned, it is not trying to stabilize the closedloop equilibrium point. It is only pushing trajectories to a small residual set around the point ( o , ~" ) , and by doing so it automatically pushes the closed-loop equilibrium point inside that set. Since the size of the residual set can be made arbitrarily small by the choice of a certain design parameter, we choose it small enough to ensure that inside the residual set the controller will act as a high-gain controller that stabilizes the closed-loop equilibrium point. At no point in our design were we required to know the exact location of the unknown closed-loop equilibrium point. This whole idea would not have been possible if we were to use state feedback, since the states in the error coordinates are again dependent on 0; and here comes the role of the high-gain observer and the globally bounded control idea of [ 101 to implement the controller using only measurement of the tracking error.</p><p>An important reason for using integral control is its robustness to model uncertainties. For linear servomechanism, it was shown that for any plant perturbation that does not destroy the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, asymptotic tracking and disturbance rejection will be achieved. In this work, as long as the uncertain parameter 6' does not change the basic structure of the plant; namely, it preserves the relative degree and the minimum-phase property, asymptotic regulation will be achieved.</p><p>The control strategy used to solve the regulation problem can be shown to solve the corresponding stabilization problem when the origin is an open-loop equilibrium point <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Also, the semiglobal result comes as a natural extension of the regional one. Our global assumption (for the semiglobal case) relaxes some of the global growth conditions available in the literature, as we did not require exponential stability of the zero dynamics nor did we require the nonlinearities to satisfy global Lipschitz conditions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>. . . . . . . . . -0r x '1' 11.
