<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper investigates a difficult problem of tracking control for robotic manipulations with guaranteed high-accuracy. Uncertain kinematics, unknown torques including unknown gravitational torque, unknown friction torque, and uncertain dynamics induced by uncertain moment of inertia and disturbance, are addressed. The approach is developed in the framework of observer-based control design. Two sliding mode observers are proposed to handle uncertain kinematics and to estimate unknown torques, respectively. Using the estimated information, a control law is then synthesized to guarantee that the desired trajectory can be followed after finite-time with zero tracking error. Experimental results are presented to show the performance of the proposed control approach.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>and repeatability. It is, therefore, imperative to employ some form of suppression or attenuation of uncertainties to achieve the desired performance. On the other hand, it is noted that most control methods are designed for joint trajectory tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. It is more convenient and desirable to drive the robot's end-effector to follow a desired trajectory on many occasions. In such a case, exact knowledge of its kinematics is required to solve an inverse kinematics problem to generate a desired position in joint space. However, due to the imprecise measurements of physical parameters and the interaction between manipulator and different environments, the kinematics parameters may not be known a prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. To enhance the task-control precision, trajectory tracking control of end-effectors has been studied extensively by many researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, with uncertain kinematics and uncertain dynamics addressed.</p><p>Currently, sliding mode control (SMC) or adaptive SMC (ASMC) is among the uncertain kinematics/dynamics attenuation techniques proposed in the literature for trajectory tracking control of robotic manipulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. That is because SMC can ensure good performance of the controlled system in the presence of a significant class of uncertainties. The early result of SMC-based control for robotic manipulators was seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, a PID sliding surface was constructed for controller design. Incorporating neural network and SMC, a neuro-SMC control was designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to handle uncertain kinematics. For a class of nonlinear mechanical systems including robotic manipulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, a multiple parameters model-based SMC law was presented to improve the tracking performance. Robustness to uncertain dynamics was guaranteed. Of particular interest, second-order SMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> or high-gain SMC have been further applied to the controller design of robot manipulators. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, trajectory planning and motion/interaction control were achieved for robot manipulators in unknown environments. The controller was developed in the theoretical framework of second-order SMC. In another recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, an integral suboptimal second-order SMC control algorithm was designed to solve motion control problem of robot manipulators.</p><p>In most SMC or ASMC-based control methods, the trajectory tracking error of robot manipulators can be only asymptotically stabilized. However, in many applications, it is preferable to accomplish the trajectory tracking control in short/finite time, and high-accuracy control is still guaranteed. To achieve this objective, a class of approaches based on terminal SMC (TSMC) have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. A global nonsingular TSMC controller was designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for robotic manipulators. Uncertain dynamics was accommodated. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, a nonsingular TSMC design was report. Fuzzy wavelet networks were used to estimate dynamic uncertainties of robotic manipulators. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, an adaptive robust SMC law was designed for rigid robot manipulators to achieve trajectory following with finite-time convergence. In a related work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, neural-network-based TSMC was designed to achieve finite-time control. Actuator dynamics of robot was considered. Another sliding mode robot control is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> that uses an exponential reaching law.</p><p>For the preceding investigations, robot control laws were designed based on a critical assumption that the uncertain dynamics should satisfy the "linearity-in-parameters" condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Moreover, tedious analysis and computations have to be conducted to determine the regressor matrix. Although a class of neural-network-based adaptive schemes has been presented for the manipulator tracking problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the application of neural network will lead to complicate computation. This would be infeasible for controller's implementation. If those uncertainties are viewed as disturbance and adaptive control is applied to handle them, then the upper bound of disturbance is needed to be estimated in controller design to achieve asymptotic control. This would lead to the problem that the designed controller has certain conservativeness, requiring more control effort to be used. Fortunately, an alternative to solve those drawbacks that has emerged in recent years is the use of the so-called "observer-based technique" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In such a design approach, an observer is employed to estimate uncertainties, and then a compensation control is proposed. The application of such a technique for the control of robotic manipulators is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. However, that estimation cannot be achieved with finite-time convergence.</p><p>Motivated by an endeavor to solve the aforementioned drawbacks, a double-sliding-mode-observers-based control approach is presented in this paper. Uncertain kinematics and uncertain dynamics are addressed simultaneously. One observer is designed to handle uncertain kinematics, and the other is to estimate uncertain dynamics. This work is the extension of the uncertainty sliding mode observer design approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> to a class of mechanical systems. However, the controller in this paper is developed in the framework of compensation control design, it is totally different from the controller presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. For the latter, the control law was synthesized by using sliding mode control technique. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) in comparison with the existing schemes in literature for the attenuation of uncertain kinematics/dynamics such as  2 -gain-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, adaptive control-based scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and sliding mode control-based scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the proposed approach can follow the desired trajectory with zero tracking error after finite time rather than with asymptotic convergence only, a faster tracking control is thus achieved, (b) compared with the previous work, the "linearity-in-parameters" assumption for the uncertain dynamics is not necessary, disturbances and uncertain moment-in-inertia in the dynamics of manipulator are also addressed; (c) the sliding mode observers proposed can achieve finite-time estimation when comparing with the existing observer-based estimation schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> for robotic manipulators.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the dynamic model of serial robotic manipulators and control objectives. The novel control approach developed based on two sliding mode observers is presented and analyzed in Section III. Section IV is devoted to discuss the case study: the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by performing experiments to a 7-DOF serial industrial robotic arm. Some conclusions, gathered in Section V, end this paper. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Problem Formulation</head><p>Many robotic tasks are naturally defined in terms of the task-space.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DOUBLE SLIDING MODE OBSERVER-BASED TRACKING CONTROL DESIGN</head><p>It can be seen in the dynamic model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) that, the control performance of robot manipulators will be affected by unknown gravitational torque ( ) G q , friction torque ( ) F q  , and uncertain dynamics ( ) H q .

In addition to that, the control performance is further affected by uncertain kinematics due to uncertain Jacobian matrix. To achieve tracking control with high accuracy, a double sliding mode observers-based control approach will be proposed in this section. The architecture of the closed-loop system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In that approach, two sliding mode observers will be designed. One observer aims to estimate the unknown torques on the dynamics, while the other one is to estimate the position of the end-effector in the presence of uncertain kinematics. Then, using the estimated information, a control law is synthesized to guarantee the global asymptotic convergence of the trajectory tracking error. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CASE STUDY</head><p>In this section, the results of the experimental verification and validation of the proposed algorithm are reported. To test the proposed control approach, a 7-DOF serial robotic manipulator with its mechanical configuration structure shown by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>, will be used as the testbed. The rigid robotic manipulator consists of seven link and seven rotational joints driven by brushless electronic motors. All motors are driven by Gold drive of Elmo Motion Inc., receiving pulse and direction signals from DSP-based controller. Moreover, the controller has a sampling time equal to 0.005 seconds. 12-bit resolvers fastened on motors supply accurate angular position/orientation measurements. The end-effector is mounted on the 7 tth joint to perform the planned mission, and its position is obtained from a laser tracker-based vision system. The dynamic position resolution of this vision system is 0.001 mm. Moreover, the signal flow of this testbed with robot controller implemented is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>.</p><p>For the serial robotic manipulator, a commonly used convention, i.e., D-H convention is utilized for selecting frames of reference in robotic applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The references for the 7-DOF robot are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. For that D-H representation, four parameters, i.e., the link length i a , the link twist i  , the link offset i d , and the joint angle i  , are associated with the th i link and the th i joint, 1, 2,..., 7 i  .</p><p>Correspondingly, the physical manipulator parameters are listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. The value of 7 d is related to the type of the end-effector. Different end-effector will lead to a different 7 d . It is worth mentioning that, although the proposed control scheme is valid for any n-degree of mobility robot manipulator, even of spatial type, only 6-DOF control was experimentally carried out by locking the third joint, during the experimental tests, for the sake of simplicity.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Experimental Results</head><p>With the application of the proposed double sliding mode-observers-based control approach to the 7-DOF serial robotic manipulator testbed. The estimation performance obtained from the incorporated sliding mode observer for handling uncertain kinematics is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. It is seen that the estimation errors e</p><p>x between x and its estimation x , is asymptotically stable. As we can see in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the actual position of the end-effector is precisely estimated by x after a short period of time, roughly 30 o T  seconds. More specifically, it is shown by the steady-state behavior of the estimation error e x in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, the estimation accuracy is smaller than 2.5e-6 mm. This accuracy is relatively high practical engineering.</p><p>Those estimation results successfully demonstrated the conclusion in Theorem 1 that, the precise estimation for the position of the end-effector can be accomplished in finite time, even in the presence of uncertain Jacobian matrix in kinematics. proposed two sliding mode observers, the controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> designed by using estimated values and output feedback was able to accomplish the planned trajectory tracking control of end-effector in the experiment. The rotation angles of each joint are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> respectively. The angular velocity of each joint is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, respectively. The control torque of each joint in the form of pulses sent to the motor drives can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. Most importantly, the following results of tracking the desired trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> are observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>. It is got from the trajectory tracking error as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">12</ref>(a) that, the desired trajectory is successfully followed after 100 seconds. This verifies the result in Theorem 3 that, the proposed observer-based controller can guarantee finite-time convergence of the tracking error. It is worth mentioning that, the response of finishing the tracking task, i.e., 100 seconds, is a little bit slow. That is due to the fact that the joint motors in the testbed have a physical limit for their velocity and acceleration. As a result, this robot testbed can not supply a fast response. It is further interesting to see in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">12</ref>(b) that, high-accuracy tracking of end-effector with the tracking error less than 0.075mm is achieved, even in the presence of uncertain kinematics, unknown torques including unknown gravitational torque, unknown friction torque, and uncertain dynamics due to uncertain inertia and external disturbances.  It should be stressed that, although it is proved that the proposed approach can govern the tracking error to zero in finite time, the tracking error is observed with non-zero value in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11(b</ref>). This phenomenon is owing to that the signum ( ) i sgn a in the controller ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_45">19</ref>) is approximated by a continuous function /(| | )</p><p>i i a a   to reduce the chattering. As a result, the tracking error with non-zero will be resulted. On the other hand, this is also because the controller can be not perfectly implemented in practice due to measurement errors of sensors and the non-perfect performance of actuators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Quantitative Analysis</head><p>To further evaluate the performance of the proposed double sliding mode observers-based control approach (DSMOBC), it is compared with the classical PID control <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, the 2 -gain-based adaptive control (L2BAC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and the nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> by using the following two performance indices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">2 1 RMS 1 1 1 || || = || ( ) || N i k N   e e , 2 RMS 1 1 || || = || ( ) || N i k N   τ τ (<label>29</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_61">)</formula><p>with 1 e as in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), ( ) k τ as in (1) but computed by the number of the pulses sent to the motor drives rather than the control torque for practical consideration, and N equal to the number of sampling steps of the experiments/simulations. The scalar When implementing PID, L2BAC, and NTSMC to robotic testbed, their control gains have been chosen by trial-and-error until a good trajectory tracking performance was obtained. We first carry out experiment that the trajectory tracking control of the testbed is accomplished in a prescribed finite time 103.4 From those two figures, it can be analyzed that:</p><p> As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">13</ref>, the proposed approach can guarantee almost the same control accuracy as NTSMC. That is because both of them are a finite-time control design method with asymptotic convergence guaranteed. However, the value  Experiment is further conducted with the tracking accuracy  <ref type="table">II</ref>. It is seen that, PID would never achieve that goal due to the effect of uncertain kinematics and uncertain dynamics. Because DSMOBC and NTSMC can guarantee that the tracking error converges to zero in theory after a finite time, those two approaches lead to almost the same time needed. In addition, by tuning control gains, L2BAC can achieve  2 -gain attenuation control for the tracking error with respect to uncertain kinematics and unknown dynamics. However, it will need more time than DSMOBC and NTSMC to guarantee the prescribed tracking accuracy. This is verified by the data in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. At the same time, the consumed energy/effort is also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">15</ref>. At this time, it is seen that L2BAC consumed more energy than other two. This is resulted by the fact that, L2BAC required more control effort and more time by tuning control gains to suppress the effect of the uncertain kinematics/dynamics acting on the robot. Once again,</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>|| || τ</head><p>of the proposed approach is less than NTSMC, since DSMOBC has less conservativeness than NTSMC.  It is worth mentioning that, the estimation performance of the incorporated observer in the designed approach can not be illustrated due to the unknown/immeasurable torques. Therefore, a set of Monte Carlo-type simulations is further performed with randomly generated initial conditions to verify the proposed control, and the desired trajectory in (28) will be still followed. The purposes of this are twofold: first, to demonstrate the performance of the controller, and second, to verify the performance of the incorporated sliding mode-based observers across a broad range of initial conditions. The initial trajectory tracking errors are randomly generated from a zero-mean normal distribution with standard deviation of 50mm. Forty simulations are performed. Another three performance indices are further used to evaluate the incorporated two observers:  <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">15</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_38">16</ref>) in the designed approach can accomplish the estimation of uncertainties induced by uncertain kinematics and unknown torques in dynamics with finite-time convergence. Those perfect estimation results and the average convergence time o T as well as e T in Table <ref type="table">III</ref> demonstrate that the observer-based controller is able to follow the desired trajectory in finite time with less conservativeness and even zero tracking error guaranteed.</p><p>Based on the aforementioned experimental and simulation results, it can be concluded that the proposed control approach can achieve high-performance tracking control for robotic manipulation even in the presence of uncertain dynamics and uncertain kinematics.  V. CONCLUSIONS An observer-based tracking control was presented for serial robotic manipulators in this study. Uncertain kinematics, uncertain dynamics, and unknown torques acting on the dynamics were addressed. The attractive features of terminal sliding mode observers were utilized to estimate the uncertainties. The estimations were achieved with finite-time convergence, and the estimation error was governed to zero after finite time. With the estimated information incorporated, a nonlinear controller was then synthesized. The effect of uncertain kinematics/dynamics was compensated. The desired trajectory was successfully followed. This new algorithm was able to achieve control of robotic manipulators with zero tracking error after finite time. High-accuracy control was thus guaranteed. The scheme has been tested both numerically and experimentally, on a real industrial robot. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of control accuracy, convergence, and robustness was confirmed by experimental results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
