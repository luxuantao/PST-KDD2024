<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A new family of codes is described that improve the reliability of digital communication over noisy, partial-response channels. The codes are intended for use on channels where the input alphabet size is limited. These channels arise in the context of digital data recording and certain data transmission applications. The codes-called matched-spectral-null codes -satisfy the property that the frequencies at which the code power spectral density vanishes correspond precisely to the frequencies at which the channel transfer function is zero. It is shown that matched-spectral-nul1 sequences provide a distance gain on the order of 3 dB and higher for a broad class of partial-response channels, including many of those of primary interest in practical applications. The embodiment of the matched-spectral-null coded partial-response system incorporates a sliding-block code and a Viterbi detector based upon a reduced-complexity trellis structure, both derived from canonical diagrams that characterize spectral-null sequences. The detectors are shown to achieve the same asymptotic average performance as maximum-likelihood sequence-detectors, and the sliding-block codes exclude quasicatastrophic trellis sequences in order to reduce the required path memory length and improve "worst-case" detector performance.

INTRODUCTION</head><p>ARTIAL RESPONSE signaling has been widely used P in data transmission since its introduction in the 1960's by Lender <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and Kretzmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Partial-response models fit a wide range of linear channels with intersym-bo1 interference, as described by <ref type="bibr">Kabal</ref> and Pasupathy [261. Fomey <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> utilized the Viterbi algorithm to accomplish maximum-likelihood sequence detection of binary data transmitted over certain partial-response channels in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The channels he considered had transfer polynomials of the form h(D)=(l-D N ) , which comprise the class of "interleaved dicode" channels, but his results effectively provided a method for maximum-likelihood detection applicable to any digital partial-response channel corrupted by AWGN. The dicode channel, with transfer polynomial h ( D ) = (1 -D), and the class-4 (PR4) channel, with transfer polynomial h ( D ) = (1 -D 2 ) , were shown by Kobayashi and Tang <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> to be attractive models for magnetic record-Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">May 9, 1990</ref>; revised <ref type="bibr">February 22, 1991</ref>.

Kobayashi <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> also gave an algorithm for maximum-likelihood detection for these channels that is essentially equivalent to the trellis-based Viterbi algorithm proposed by Forney. Simulation studies and experimental evaluation of binary partial-response signaling with maximum-likelihood detection in the context of magnetic recording were carried out by Wood and Peterson <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. See also Dolivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Thapar and Pate1 [651 proposed a more general class of models for magnetic recording, defined by transfer polynomials of the form h ( D ) = ( l -DX1+ D ) N , where N is a nonnegative integer. In subsequent literature related to recording, the channel corresponding to N = 2 has figured prominently, and has often been called extended class-4 partial-response (EPR41, a practice we will follow.</p><p>Trellis-coding techniques for binary partial-response channels with transfer polynomials h ( D ) = (1 f D N ) have been recently proposed by Wolf and Ungerboeck <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>, Calderbank, Heegard, and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Immink 1241, and Karabed and Siegel <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In all of these, the constructions are based upon binary codes, typically convolutional, that have attractive Hamming distance properties for a given rate and decoder complexity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>, the code is concatentated with a precoder that essentially inverts (modulo 2) the channel transfer function. The minimum squared-Euclidean distance at the channel output is then lower bounded by the smallest, even integer greater than or equal to the minimum Hamming distance of the code. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, an inversion technique is used to design a new code that will produce, at the channel output, sequences that correspond to the original code sequences (modulo 2). This approach leads to a lower bound on minimum Euclidean distance that is similar to the one based on the channel precoder technique. The lower bounds suggest the use of codes that achieve the largest minimum Hamming distance for a given rate and complexity. The codes are usually extracted from tables of convolutional codes, such as those found, for example, in Lin and Costello <ref type="bibr">[47,</ref> p. 3311. In most cases examined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the lower bound proves to be tight.</p><p>In applications involving partial-response class-4 (twice-interleaved dicode) with maximum-likelihood detection, certain constraints on runlengths of zero samples at the channel output and in the interleaved substrings are desirable for purposes of timing and gain control, as well as to reduce path-memory requirements in the Viterbi detector. See, for example, <ref type="bibr">Marcus and Siegel [511,</ref><ref type="bibr">[521.</ref> 0018-9448/91/0500-0818$01.00 01991 IEEE -~ To ensure zero-runlength constraints on the trellis-coded partial-response output sequences, a coset of the underlying convolutional code is used in both [661 and [51. Since the binary partial-response channels addressed by these methods have uncoded minimum Euclidean distance fi; the gain in minimum distance provided by the trellis code in this context is, in a sense, 3 dB less than the gain in the minimum Hamming distance that the code provides on a memoryless channel, as noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>.</p><p>In [241, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, [341 the convolutional code is used in conjunction with an inner code that produces channel output sequences whose minimum squared-Euclidean distance is bounded below by a multiple of the minimum Hamming distance of the original code. Significant increases in the minimum Euclidean distance at the channel output can be achieved using this approach, but at the expense of significant losses in overall code rate. Zerorunlength constraints are provided directly by the inner codes. As with all of the techniques discussed so far, the trellis structure of the maximum-likelihood detector reflects the combined memory of the code and the partialresponse channel.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to describe a new class of trellis codes for partial-response channels. These codes exploit, rather than nullify, the channel memory in order to enhance minimum distance properties, while reducing the complexity of the Viterbi detectors, relative to the previously developed codes reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The key idea underlying the new technique is the use of codes with a spectral null of order K in the code power spectrum, where K &gt; 1 , at the frequencies where the channel transfer function has a spectral null of order L, where L 2 1. We refer to this new class of trellis codes as matched-spectral-null ( M S N ) codes. The general theory of MSN codes was first reported in [291, <ref type="bibr">[301, [311, [331, [361.</ref> The theoretical basis and construction techniques for MSN codes were shown to involve ideas and results from several different areas, including: characterization of sequences with (possibly higher order) spectral nulls at zero frequency or any rational submultiple of the symbol frequency, as developed by Yoshida The paper is organized in such a way that it breaks naturally into three parts. Part 1 attempts to give a high-level view, consisting of this introduction (Section I) and a detailed description and analysis of several MSNcoded partial-response systems (Section 11). Part 2 addresses the characterization of spectral null sequences (Section 111) and their distance properties (Section IV). Part 3 examines the coding gain provided by MSN-codes on partial-response channels (Section VI, as well as issues related to the construction of efficient MSN codes and their demodulation using reduced-complexity detector trellis structures (Section VI).</p><p>A more detailed description of the remainder of the paper is as follows.</p><p>In Section 11, several examples of matched-spectral-nul1 codes are discussed. In Sections II-A, II-B, and II-C we describe the examples that provided the motivation for this investigation and that nicely illustrate key aspects of the MSN coding technique. Section II-A examines the biphase code for the dicode channel, first (to our knowledge) mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and independently investigated by Immink [24], Zehavi <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref>, and Karabed and Siegel <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Section II-B describes the even-mark modulation code for the class-1 (duobinary, PRO channel, discussed by <ref type="bibr">Karabed and Siegel [32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. These examples demonstrate the increased minimum Euclidean distance produced by MSN codes, as well as the existence of reduced-complexity Viterbi detectors that achieve the same asymptotic performance as a maximum-likelihood detector in the presence of AWGN. Section II-C presents further beneficial applications of these codes to other partial-response channels, in particular the interleavedbiphase (IB) code on the PR4 and EPR4 channels 1241, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and the EMM code on the class-2 (PR2) channel. These applications, initially unexpected, turn out to be quite natural in the context of MSN coding.</p><p>In Section II-D, we present new MSN codes, with rates R = 2/3, R = 3/4, and R = 4/5, for the binary dicode channel. We compare the codes, on the basis of simulated performance and detector complexity, to their counterparts among the codes developed by Wolf and Ungerboeck <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>, illustrating some of the potential practical advantages of the MSN coding method.</p><p>The examples in this section reflect the original motivation for this investigation, namely the need for high-rate codes for binary partial-response channels relevant to digital data recording. The general theory of MSN codes, however, applies to multilevel partial-response channels, as well, and several authors have investigated and designed interesting quaternary MSN codes; see, for example, Haeb <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Eleftheriou and Cideciyan [10]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Section I11 addresses the characterization of sequences with higher order spectral null constraints. In Section III-A, we give several equivalent necessary and sufficient conditions for ensembles of sequences, representable as functions of a finite-state Markov-chain, to have a spectral null of order K at zero frequency or any rational submultiple of the symbol frequency, meaning that their power spectral density and its derivatives through order 2K -1 vanish at the specified frequency. The necessary and sufficient conditions for a spectral null of order K extend in a natural way the previous results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>, [SI, <ref type="bibr">[591, and [69]</ref>. Specifically, the conditions are expressed in terms of vanishing order-K power-sums (moments), bounded order-K running-digital-sums, and order-K coboundary conditions at the spectral null frequency. In Section III-B, the coboundary conditions are used to define canonical diagrams for order-K spectral</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I I 'I1 - - A I I _</formula><p>lossless of finite order can be viewed as "deterministic with bounded delay." Section IV investigates distance properties of spectral null codes. In Section IV-A, we derive lower bounds on the minimum Euclidean distance of integer sequences with a spectral null of order K at zero frequency or a rational submultiple of the symbol frequency. These bounds generalize earlier results of Immink and Beenker <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for binary block codes with Kth-order zero-disparity. We give two proofs of the lower bound in the case of integer sequences with null of order K at zero frequency. One is based upon Newton's identities, extending the proof for binary block codes in [251. The other, making use of Descartes' rule of signs, keeps track of sign changes in the sequences, and provides additional insight into the structure of sequences with spectral null of order K at zero ft-equency and the known solutions of the numbertheoretic equal-power-sums problem.</p><p>The extension of the distance bounds to other spectral null frequencies required new techniques, and the proof presented in Section IV-B uses certain tools and results from number theory, including the Legendre symbols (see, for example, Niven and Zuckerman <ref type="bibr">[57, p. 691)</ref> and the Gaussian sum formula (see, for example Lang <ref type="bibr">[45, p. 561</ref>) that have also surfaced in other signal processing applications, as described by McClellan and Rader <ref type="bibr">[54, p. 2041</ref> and Schroeder [60, p. 1721.</p><p>In Section V, the distance properties of spectral null sequences, as developed in Section IV are used to prove the main results about the asymptotic coding gain attainable with matched-spectral-nul1 codes on partial-response channels. In Section V-A, we address the case of certain multilevel code symbol alphabets. Applying the numbertheoretic results related to the equal-power-sums problem, we derive a lower bound on the asymptotic coding gain for channels with a spectral null of order L at zero frequency or at a rational submultiple of the symbol frequency, when 1 I L I 10, and the symbol alphabet is large. In Section V-B, for a more restricted set of spectral null frequencies and channel null orders, we obtain a lower bound on the asymptotic coding gain of MSN codes for channels with binary input alphabet.</p><p>In Section VI, we discuss the structure of practical encoders, decoders, and demodulators (Viterbi detectors) for MSN trellis codes. The canonical diagrams for spectral null constraints, as described in Section 111, provide the framework for addressing two key problems related to practical realization of the MSN coding gains. Section VI-A briefly reviews some basic results in symbolic dynamics required in the following sections. In Section VI-B, we define reduced-complexity Viterbi detectors that can be used to demodulate the MSN codes. The trellis structures underlying the demodulators are based upon the canonical diagrams describing the spectral null constraints, rather than upon an actual encoder finite-statemachine or other presentations of the actual code con-straints. Using results from Marcus [-SO], we investigate the problem of quasicatastrophic error-propagation (in the sense of <ref type="bibr">Forney and Calderbank [14]</ref>) and prove that it can be prevented by requiring that the code avoid certain sequences, called quasicatastrophic sequences, that are characterized in terms of the trellis structure underlying the detector. This additional constraint on the code eliminates the potential loss in effective asymptotic coding gain that can arise, in the presence of a finite path memory in the detector, when the code contains these sequences. In Section VI-C, we apply the sliding-block code design methods of Adler, Coppersmith, and Hassner <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, Marcus <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, and the more recent work of Karabed and Marcus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> to prove the existence of efficient sliding-block codes with specified spectral null constraints at rates arbitrarily close to 1, and to indicate algorithms for their construction. We also show that, in the design of a MSN code for use with a given detector trellis, the quasicatastrophic sequences can be avoided without incurring any additional rate penalty. Finally, in Section VI-D, we show that the reduced-complexity demodulators achieve effectively maximum-likelihood performance (in the presence of AWGN).</p><p>In the conclusions, we summarize the main results and indicate some of the future research directions suggested by this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">MOTIVATING EXAMPLES AND FURTHER APPLICATIONS</head><p>This section describes in detail several examples of matched-spectral-nul1 (MSN) codes applicable to digital and optical recording channels. We begin with two specific codes that nicely illustrate (and, historically, motivated) the MSN coding technique. These examples are followed by higher rate MSN codes for the dicode channel that will be compared to previously proposed trellis codes with the same rates and asymptotic coding gains.</p><p>Remarks on Terminology: Throughout this paper, we will use the term binary to refer to the alphabet {O,l}, and the term bipolar to refer to the alphabet ( f l}. The bipolar version of a binary sequence will mean the sequence obtained by substituting the symbol -1 for the symbol 0.</p><p>The expression free Euclidean (respectively, Hamming) distance, denoted dfree (respectively, d:ee), used in reference to the set of sequences generated by a specified directed, labeled graph, will mean the minimum Euclidean (respectively, Hamming) distance among pairs of sequences corresponding to paths in the graph that differ in only a finite number of edges. Various concepts of free or minimum distance that are important in evaluating the performance of MSN codes will be addressed in more detail in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Biphase Code for Dicode Channel</head><p>As mentioned in the introduction, the binary 1 -D channel (dicode) and binary 1 -D 2 channel (class-4) are useful partial-response models for the magnetic recording .  channel. Since the class-4 channel is simply "interleaved dicode," previous techniques have concentrated on codes for the 1 -D channel. For example, the precoding method of [661 and the inversion technique of [51 yield codes of comparable complexity for a given code rate R and asymptotic coding gain (ACG). The ACG for channels with binary (or bipolar) input restriction is given by where d,, is the minimum Euclidean distance between channel output sequences corresponding to channel input sequences differing in a finite number of positions.</p><p>Remark: For channels with multilevel inputs, the definition of asymptotic coding gain should incorporate a measure of average input power, as is done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and in [10]-[121. Also see Section V-C.</p><p>To achieve R = 1 / 2 with ACG =1.8 dB, both prior approaches generate a code requiring 8 states in the trellis of the Viterbi detector incorporating the structure of the code and the characteristics of the dicode channel. In [5] (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, [701), however, it is pointed out that the simple block code known as the "biphase code" also satisfies these parameters, although it is not produced by direct application of the techniques of [661, [51. Moreover, the corresponding Viterbi detector has only two states. The binary biphase code is defined by the encoding rule in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>.</p><p>The trellis that represents the output sequences of the biphase-coded 1-D channel is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">1</ref>. The labels of the edges are x , x 2 / y 1 y 2 where x l x z is the biphase codeword corresponding to the channel input, and y , y 2 is the associated 1 -D channel output. It is not difficult to see that the free Euclidean distance of the coded channel satisfies d&amp;, = 6, as illustrated by the pair of paths shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Since the uncoded 1-D channel has free Euclidean distance satisfying d;,, = 2, it is clear that the asymptotic coding gain is 1.8 dB.</p><p>A heuristic explanation of why the methods of [66] or [5] generate a more complex trellis code for this rate and ACG is that, in both constructions, the coded-channel output sequences, reduced modulo 2, define a binary convolutional code that is chosen to achieve the largest possible free Hamming distance, for the specified rate</p></div>

This code has free Hamming distance d:,, = 1, which is clearly not optimal for rate 1/2 binary block codes.</p><p>A basic motivation for the research reported in this paper was to understand what underlying properties made the biphase code so efficient, and to determine if the code could be usefully extended. We now examine several key features that will be characteristic of the more general family of MSN trellis codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spectral Null Properties:</head><p>The (bipolar) biphase code and the dicode channel share a common spectral property. The power spectrum of the bipolar biphase code and the transfer function of the dicode channel both have zero magnitude at zero frequency. To see this, observe that the bipolar code sequences, with random phase, are generated by the finite-state transition diagram (FSTD) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Using the methods of <ref type="bibr">Gallopoulos,</ref><ref type="bibr">Heegard,</ref><ref type="bibr">and Siege1 [16]</ref>, for example, one can determine that the code power spectrum is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">@ BIPHASE( f = sin2 ( TfT ) Y</formula><p>where it is assumed that the encoder is driven by equally probable binary inputs. The power spectral density (with T = 1) is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Note also that the frequency response H(f)</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">of the 1 -D channel [26] is given by H ( f ) = 12T sin ( T ~T ) ,</formula><p>where L denotes the square root of -1. The magnitude of H(f) (with T = 1) is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>It is readily verified that the code and channel share a spectral null at zero frequency. Distance Properties: As mentioned above, the biphase-code triples the minimum squared-Euclidean distance at the output of the dicode channel, assuming a binary input restriction. This corresponds to a 4.8-dB gain in distance, or an asymptotic coding gain of 1.8 dB. Note also that the minimum Hamming distance of the binary code is two, a 3-dB gain in Hamming distance relative to the set of all binary sequences. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Runlength-Limitation:</head><p>The output sequences of the biphase-coded dicode channel never have a runlength of more than one zero-sample. The limitation of consecutive zero-samples is critical for decisiondirected timing and gain control, as mentioned in the introduction. Efficient Code Implementation: From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we can see that, starting from any state, the bipolar biphase code sequences never have an imbalance of symbols 1 and -1 exceeding two; in other words, the running-digital-sum <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref> always has magnitude less than or equal to two. This property accounts for the spectral null at zero frequency. It has been shown that any finite-state bipolar code with maximum running-digital-sum bounded in magnitude by two must produce a subset of the sequences generated by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, and for this reason, the diagram is considered "canonical" for this running-digital-sum constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>. Therefore, the maximum rate of any such code is bounded above by the Shannon capacity of the canonical diagram, and this capacity is easily proved to be C = 1/2. It follows that the bipolar biphase code, which has rate 1/2, achieves the maximum possible rate for this RDS constraint. Eterbi Detector Based on Canonical Diagram: From Property 4), it can be seen that the Viterbi detector trellis in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">1</ref> may be thought of as the trellis derived directly from the binary version of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. In other words, the Viterbi detector of the bipolar biphase code may be regarded as a maximum-likelihood detector for sequences with running-digitalsum magnitude bounded by two, transmitted over a dicode channel. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_62">6</ref> shows the asymptotically tight lower bound on the performance of the biphasecoded dicode channel with this Viterbi detector. The bound is based upon the well-known expression in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where, in this case, the error-coefficient for the coded channel is 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Euen-Mark-Modulation for Duobinaiy Channel</head><p>The second MSN-code example is the even-mark-moddation (EMM) code for optical recording <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. We begin the discussion of this code with a brief review of optical recording channel characteristics, noting similarities and differences relative to magnetic recording channels.</p><p>The optical recording channel transfer function resembles that of a lowpass filter. In analogy to the partialresponse models for magnetic recording described in [651, one can define a family of models for optical recording with transfer polynomials, h ( D ) = (1 + D ) N , for N 2 1. The partial-response channel with h ( D ) = 1 + D (vari- ously called duobinary, class-1 or PR1) and the channel with h ( D ) = (1 + D)* (PR2) represent the optical recording equivalents of the PR4 and EPR4 channels used in magnetic recording.</p><p>Optical recording channels also have certain unique features that have led to the definition of a new class of constrained codes that satisfy asymmetrical runlengthlimitations, as described by Davie, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Asymmetrical runlength-limited (ARLL) constraints take advantage of the fact that, while the minimum size of a written mark is determined by the laser beam diameter produced by the focusing optics, the minimum space between written marks is governed by the accuracy of positioning of the laser spot, which can be finer than the minimum mark size. The ARLL constraints therefore specify separate minimum and maximum runlength limitations for 1's (written areas) and 0's (unwritten areas). The constraints are de-  <ref type="figure">noted (d',</ref><ref type="figure">m'),</ref><ref type="figure">where (d',</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref> used in the EMM method also satisfy the additional requirement that written marks must be euen in length. The finite-state transition diagram representing these constraints is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p><p>The rate 2/3 code satisfying the EMM constraints (described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and referred to, using a slight abuse of terminology, as the EMM code) provides a bridge from the biphase code to the more general trelliscoded modulation technique based upon matched-spectral-null codes, particularly with regard to certain code properties related to the use of reduced-complexity Viterbi detectors. As we did previously with the biphase code, we now highlight the main properties of this code.</p></div>

The power spectral density (with T = 1) is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. (The power spectrum also contains discrete lines at integer multiples of 1/ T, not shown here). The frequency response of the PR1 channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> satisfies: HPR1(f) = 2Tcos.rrfT. The magnitude of this frequency response (with T = 1) is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">9</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Runlength-Limitations:</head><p>For the purposes of datadriven timing and gain control, it is desirable to limit the maximum runlength of identical output samples. This requirement translates into a restriction on the channel inputs, limiting the number of consecutive symbols 0 and 1, as well as the length of runs of the form 1010 . . . given by C=log,h, where A is the largest real eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix A of the graph in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A = [ : h].</formula><p>It is easy to check that A = (1 + 6 ) / 2 , implying that</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">C = 0.6923 ' * . , suggesting a practical code rate R = 2/3.</formula><p>As previously mentioned, in addition to the EMM constraint, we want to impose additional limitations on the maximum run of 0's and 1's at the channel input in order to facilitate decision-directed timing and gain control. The runlength limits on 1's and 0's were chosen to be k ' = 12, m ' = 8, as can be seen from the modified EMM FSTD in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>. With a carefully chosen sequence of state-splittings and state-mergings, the rate 2/3 encoder shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I1</ref> was designed. The underlying finite-state-machine has eight states. The sliding block decoder requires a decoding window of twelve bits, implying that a single code-bit error can propagate to at most eight bits (one byte) of data, another attractive property from the practical standpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kterbi Detector Based on Canonical Diagram:</head><p>The diagram for the bipolar EMM constraint, corresponding to the binary constraint in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, is a canonical diagram for bipolar sequences with a spectral null at 1/2T, and with running-digital-sums at f = 1/2T that assume only values bounded in magnitude by three. The trellis diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_58">10</ref> therefore provides the basis for maximum-likelihood detection of the (binary) spectral null sequences when used on a 1 + D channel.  The same trellis can be used to demodulate the rate 2/3 EMM code when it is applied to the 1 + D channel. The trellis structure represents a considerable simplification compared to the structure required for a maximum-likelihood detector based on the 8-state finite-state-machine encoder. Moreover, as we will now explain, the asymptotic performance of the reduced-complexity demodulator approaches that of the maximum-likelihood detector, despite the fact that the trellis generates sequences not contained in the image of the rate 2/3 code. At moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios, the average performance of the maximum-likelihood detector is largely determined by the minimum Euclidean distance between output sequences corresponding to any pair of valid code sequences. For the rate 2/3 EMM code it is easily shown that d 2 = 4 is the minimum. In addition, since the code has finite memory (see Section VI), the maximum length of any error event achieving this distance is bounded by a fixed finite number.</p><p>When considering the reduced-complexity trellis in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_58">10</ref> as the basis for demodulation of the EMM code, we must make note of a characteristic not present in the biphase-coded dicode example: The trellis contains semi-infinite paths beginning at the same state that correspond to sequences with Eucidean distance strictly less that the free distance of the trellis (recall the remark at the beginning of Section 11). For example, the paths determined by the state sequences The Viterbi detector path memory length required to distinguish these sequences is unbounded, so any truncation of the trellis history would force a decision between survivor sequences at one-half of the free distance, potentially degrading the "worstcase" performance of the system. The reason for this phenomenon-called quasicatastrophic errorpropagation t141-i~ that the infinite sequence of constrained symbols 1 is generated by two distinct paths in the EMM diagram pictured in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p><p>In the rate 2/3 EMM code, the maximum runlength of 1's is 12, a limit imposed also for the purpose of improved timing recovery. It follows (see Section VI-B) that there is an integer r , which we refer to as the generalized truncation depth, such that the squared-Euclidean distance between any channel output sequence of length T produced by a code sequence, and any other trellis sequence of the same length and generated from the same trellis state, must be at least as large as the free squared-Euclidean distance dice = 4. This property of the EMM code, resulting from the elimination of the sequence that causes the quasicatastrophic errorpropagation, ensures that the detector based upon the reduced-complexity trellis with a path memory of length at least r will achieve the same asymptotic performance, as the signal-to-noise-ratio increases, as a maximum-likelihood detector for the coded channel. The results of a computer simulation of the EMM-coded PR1 channel are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Additional Applications of B@huse and EMM Codes</head><p>The preceding examples-the biphase code and the even-mark-modulation code-illustrate the main properties of MSN trellis codes for partial-response channels. We summarize the key features in the form of the following set of general observations that will be formalized and made precise in the subsequent sections of this paper.</p><p>Observation I: Codes with spectral nulls can provide significant increases in the minimum Euclidean distance at the output of partial-response channels when the spectral null frequencies of the code and channel coincide.</p><p>Observation 2: Efficient spectral null codes with finitestate encoders and sliding block decoders can be constructed from canonical diagrams describing the underlying spectral null constraint. Observation 3: Reduced-complexity trellis structures, derived from the same canonical diagrams, provide the basis for Viterbi detectors which achieve the same asymptotic performance as a maximum-likelihood detector, in the presence of additive, white, Gaussian noise. With these observations in mind, we now illustrate how the biphase code and the EMM code find new applications in the context of MSN coding.</p><p>The interleaved-biphase (IB) code is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x1xz --$ x 1 x 2 i 1 i 2 ,</formula><p>where xl, x 2 are bits and the bar signifies binary complementation. The sequences of the binary IB code are generated by the diagram shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_61">14</ref>.</p><p>The application of IB to the 1 -D 2 (PR4) channel is suggested by the interleaving approach to code design for 1 -D N channels, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> and [51. Since the 1 -D 2 channel is simply "interleaved dicode," two copies of the trellis of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">1</ref> can be utilized to describe the even subsequence and the odd subsequence of outputs, respectively. From this it is clear that the distance gain is identical to that of the biphase code on the dicode channel, namely 4.8 dB.</p><p>A successful application to the EPR4 channel, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">q ~) = 1 + D -0 2 -0 3 = (1 -~) ( 1 + D )</formula><p>~ is not so obviously anticipated. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">15</ref> shows the trellis diagram representing the sequences at the output of the IB-coded EPR4 channel. (Note that a component of the fourth power of the FSTD is used). From this four-state detector, we find a minimum distance pair of paths giving dtree( IB/EPR4) = 12, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_80">16</ref>. Since the uncoded, binary EPR4 channel has free distance d;re,(EPR4) = 4, we see that the interleaved biphase code again achieves 4.8 dB increase in free distance. lossless of finite order can be viewed as "deterministic with bounded delay." . It is not difficult to verify that the bipolar IB code has first-order spectral nulls at f = 0 and f = 1/2T. Referring to [53], we see that the bipolar version of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_61">14</ref> is a subdiagram of the canonical graph Go,'/2 that generates bipolar sequences with spectral nulls at f = 0 and f = 1/2T. The power density spectrum of the bipolar IB code is given by ais( f ) = 2T sin' (27rfT), and is shown (with T = 1) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">17</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">" C. ._ 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 / 2 0-2 0 / 1-1 0 2 / 2 1-1-2 / l o 1 0 1 / 0-1 1 0 I /-1 1 2 0 1 1 / 1-1-2 0 / 0-2 0 2 / 1 0-1-2 / 0 1-1 0 /-1 0 1 2 / 0 2 0-2 /-1 0-1 0 /-2-1 1 2 /-1 1 0-2 /-</formula><p>The PR4 and EPR4 channels also have spectral nulls in their transfer functions at f = 0 and f = 1/2T.

The magnitudes of these transfer functions (with T = 1) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">18</ref>. The correspondence of code spectral null frequencies and the channel null frequencies is clear. The error-coefficient for both the uncoded and IB-coded EPR4 channels is 2. The asymptotically tight lower bound on the performance of the IB-coded EPR4 channel is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19</ref>.</p><p>Finally, with regard to runlength-limitations, it is easily checked that at the output of the coded PR4 channel, the maximum runlength of zero-samples is two, and, at the output of the coded EPR4 channel, the maximum runlength of zero-samples is one.</p><p>We now discuss the application of the EMM code to the class-2 (PR2) partial-response channel with system     Therefore, the EMM constraint provides a gain in free distance of 4 dB.</p><p>The (1 + DI2 channel has frequency response</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H ( f ) =4Tcos2(afT),</formula><p>the magnitude of which (with T = 1) is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_34">22</ref>.</p><p>Referring to Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>, we see that the EMM power spectrum and the PR2 channel have a coincident null at f = 1/2T. Computer-simulated performance of the EMM-coded PR2 channel is compared to asymptoticallytight performance estimates for the ARLL-coded PR2 channel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_83">23</ref>. (For the EMM-coded channel, the loss relative to the 4 dB gain suggested by the minimum distance improvement is a result of the large ratio of its error coefficient to that of the ARLL-coded channel). Remark: Some examples, such as the biphase code and EMM code, provide distance gains which exceed the gains predicted by the matched-spectral-null coding theorem (Theorem 9 in Section V). This behavior appears to be characteristic of codes with relatively low rate and tighter constraints on the running-digital-sum values. As the rate increases, however, the lower bound on gains will reduce to the levels predicted by the theorem. An interesting open problem is to understand and quantify this behavior more precisely.</p></div>

In all cases, the path memory was taken long enough to eliminate any performance degradation due to truncation effects (see Section VI).

MSN CODE DESIGN AND DEMODULATION</head><p>In this section, we describe techniques for designing the encoder/decoder mappings for MSN codes, and reduced-complexity Viterbi detectors that provide nearmaximum-likelihood performance.

Viewed as labeled graphs, these covers are isomorphic. (Sketch of proof: Since rH is right resolving, the construction in Proposition 4 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> defines a l-block factor map 8: H -t C l (with symbols corresponding to edges) from H to the minimal Shannon cover, such that rrH = r: 0 8.

However, from the practical standpoint of detector implementation, the path memory required to approach the predicted average performance is dependent on the truncation depth, representing the minimum length T with the property that any pair of sequences of length T generated by paths diverging from the same state in the trellis must have distance at least as large as d , &gt;(SI.  example, the truncation depth is unbounded.

In words, 9 consists of the bi-infinite sequences with multiple distinct preimages in Zs, a condition implying that, for each quasicatastrophic sequence q, there is more than one path in Zs that "generates" q.</p><p>Remark: From Proposition 9, it follows that the set of quasicatastrophic sequences has measure zero when S is endowed with its Shannon measure (the measure of maximal entropy).</p><p>Remark: A similar concept was also introduced in [5] using the terminology "flawed sequences." In [141, the notion of a quasicatastrophic trellis was defined. We can rephrase that definition in the following manner: The trellis corresponding to Zs is quasicatastrophic if and only if the set of quasicatastrophic sequences 9 in S is nonempty.</p><p>Example 7: Let S be the output sequences of the binary 1 -D channel. In this case,</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">9 = { q E Slq, = O for all i } ,</formula><p>that is, 9 contains simply the all 0's sequence. If a sequence contains a 1 or -1, the corresponding edge in the path in Zs is uniquely determined, or "resolved."</p><p>Since the map r s is both left-and right resolving, the preimage of S is then uniquely determined.</p><p>The example suggests a useful, alternative characterization of 9, given in Lemma 10. First, we recall from Section V-A-1 the definition of a resolving block in S. Definition 20: A resolving block is a block s = s1 . .s, in S for which there is an index i E [ l , . . . , n ] such that if u = u1 . . . U, and U = u1 . . . U, are words in Zs with r s ( u ) = s = r S ( u ) , then u i = ui. (In particular, since r s is right resolving in the case of our canonical diagrams, the i above can be chosen to be n.) Lemma 10: Let S be AFT. Then 9 is the set of sequences in S that do not contain a resolving block.</p><p>Moreover, the set 9 is a closed subset of S.</p><p>Proofi We first show that if SE^, then s does not contain a resolving block. For, suppose s E S contains a resolving block s = s l . . . st. If r s ( u ) = s , then U , is uniquely determined. Since r s is right resolving and left closing, it follows that U is uniquely determined, so s 4 9.</p><p>Conversely, if s does not contain a resolving block, then, because r s is both right resolving and left closing, it is easy to see that s must have at least two preimages.</p><p>The fact that 9 is closed follows from the fact that the sofic system is AFT [501.

Since the alphabet is finite, there are only a finite number of such blocks, so some block must reappear in U.

The transform of the defining equation is W f ) H ( f ) = 0, where H(f) is the frequency response of the channel h(D). Therefore, if U # 0, U ( f ) must consist of nonzero spectral lines at some nonempty subset of the frequencies F where H(f) takes the value zero. But, by assumption, S consists of sequences whose Fourier spectral component is zero at all of the frequencies in F, so U = st would have to have this property as well.

The only remark that needs to be made is that the subshifts of finite type defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> consist of sequences that contain resolving blocks of S (quasiperiodically, in fact). Therefore, those subshifts must be contained in S -9, by Lemma 10. 0 Remark: It is often necessary to incorporate other code constraints in order to ensure compatibility of the channel output sequences with algorithms for timing and gain control [9]. For gain control, more specifically, output sequences with long runs of 0's are to be avoided. More generally, for timing control, output sequences should minimize the length of runs of any identical sample values. In some cases of interest, the spectral null constraint inherently provides very effective runlength constraints. For example, for the 1 -D channel with first-order spectral null at zero frequency, the finite-state-transition diagrams H i in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_83">24</ref> limit the maximum runlength to N-2.</p><p>For the 1 + D channel with binary inputs {O,l}, the canonical subdiagrams limit only the maximum runlength of output l's, since they incorporate an inherent limitation on the length of runs of the form 1 0 1 0 ---.</p><p>Therefore the input runlengths of 0's and 1's must be further restricted to ensure constraints on the output runlengths of 0's and 2's. For example, as mentioned in Section 11-B, the EMM code was designed to restrict the length of the maximum run of 0's (resp. 1's) at the channel input to 8 (resp. 12). See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>.</p><p>The capacity of this modified EMM constraint is approximately 0.6880, as compared to the original EMM capacity log2((l + &amp;)/2) = 0.6942.

Pei+ormance Evaluation of MSN-Coded Channels</head><p>The results of the previous section indicate that, when d &lt; &gt;(Cl) = d &lt; &gt;(Sf), a Viterbi detector using the trellis derived from the minimal cover H' will provide asymptotically the same error-event probability as a maximum-likelihood detector for C', which would use the typically more complex trellis incorporating the structure of the code C and the channel memory.</p><p>The standard bound for the probability of an error event, assuming independent noise samples with Gaussian distribution having mean zero and variance u2, is therefore Pr(event) 2 N,,Q ~ ( d(::" 1 where d(C',S') is the minimum distance between any sequence in C' and any distinct sequence in S',Q is the complementary error function, and Ns, is the "error coefficient" that expresses the average number of sequences in S' at this distance from a sequence in C'.</p><p>We know from Section V that d ( C ' , S ' ) 2 d &lt; ,(SI) 2 2( K + L ) , so the asymptotic performance, in the limit of increasing signal-to-noise ratio, is the same as a maximum-likelihood detector. The error coefficient for the reduced complexity detector may be larger than for the maximum-likelihood detector, but in all of the examples that we have examined in which the rate of the code C was near the capacity Cap(S), the effect of the difference in error coefficients was insignificant even at low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratios, as illustrated by the examples of MSN-coded channels in Section 11.</p><p>We summarize these observations in the form of the following theorem. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_79">Let H ,</ref><ref type="figure">H',</ref><ref type="figure">S,</ref><ref type="figure">S',</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref> , and C' be as previously stated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 11:</head><p>Therefore, for moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios, the asymptotic performance achieved by the code C, in conjunction with the reduced complexity trellis based on H', is comparable to the gain promised by the matchedspectral-null code theorem, Theorem 9.</p><p>Typically, the complexity of the trellis derived from H' is considerably simpler than the trellis based upon the code C, as measured, for example, by number of states, number of edges per trellis stage, or the number of arithmetic/logical operations required per detected data bit. In addition, if H , and therefore H', are periodic with period P, the code C and detector trellis can be based upon an irreducible component of the Pth power of H , denoted H P , which is defined as the FSTD with the same states as H , and with edges and edge labels corresponding to paths of length P in H . The trellis will then be appropriate for detecting a code with rate p : q, where the period P divides q.</p><p>When the number of states in the trellis is reduced, the path memory hardware is proportionally reduced. If, moreover, the code C has finite memory and avoids the quasicatastrophic sequences 9 c S, the results of Section VI-B imply that the path memory can be further simplified because of the bounded generalized truncation depth.</p><p>Remark: A similar approach to "near maximum-likelihood" detection of a spectral null code was reported by Wood [67] in the context of a memoryless channel (that is, without intersymbol interference). He developed a reduced-complexity detector for the binary Miller-squared code, which is a rate 1/2 code with first-order spectral null at zero frequency. The code has free Hamming distance given by representing an increase in minimum distance of 3 dB compared to the uncoded binary channel. The code sequences are generated by the subdiagram H ; of the canonical diagram for a simple spectral null at zero frequency, and the detector represents an approximation to the Viterbi algorithm based on the trellis derived from H:. The code does contain quasicatastrophic sequences, however.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has presented a new trellis-coded modulation technique applicable to a broad class of partialresponse channels. The codes are primarily intended for applications in which the channel input alphabet is fixed. The codes, which we call matched-spectral-null (MSN) codes, have zeros in their power spectral density function (and its derivatives) at precisely the same frequencies as the transfer function of the partial-response channel. Systems of integer-valued sequences having higher-order spectral nulls at rational submultiples of the symbol frequency were characterized. Euclidean distance properties of these spectral null constraints were then derived, and a lower bound on the coding gain of MSN codes was proved. Canonical diagrams which characterize higher order spectral null constraints were used to define de-modulators with reduced-complexity trellises. These were shown to provide performance close to maximum-likelihood detection for efficient sliding-block codes derived from the diagrams. It was shown that elimination of quasicatastrophic sequences from the code could simplify the detector implementation and avoid quasicatastrophic error-propagation.</p><p>The theory of MSN codes is appealing from an intuitive standpoint. It is consistent with the well-known adage that "the code spectrum should match the channel transfer characteristics." In the context of waveform channels with average input-power constraints, this design criterion was made precise by the classical derivations of channel capacity, and the features of a capacity-achieving signal spectrum could be visualized using the "water-filling" interpretation. For input-restricted partial-response channels, the MSN theory identifies a specific, frequencydomain characterisitc-the location and order of spectral nulls-and indicates the benefits that can accrue when code and channel match in this respect. An interesting problem for future investigation is the elaboration of this analogy, from both theoretical and practical standpoints.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[69], Pierobon [59], Marcus and Siegel [53], Monti and Pierobon [55]; distance properties of these sequences, as studied by Immink and Beenker 1251; symbolic dynamics and its application to sliding-block code construction, as pioneered by Adler, Coppersmith, and Hassner [l], Marcus [501, and Karabed and Marcus [28]; and, finally, classical number-theoretic results related to the equal-power-sums problem [ 19, p. 3281, [22, Chapter 181, cyclotomic polynomials [54, p. 721 and the Gaussian sum formula [45, p. 561.</figDesc></figure>

Then, (G,T) has an order-K spectral null at f = M / N T if and only if for every difference event e, the difference polynomial e ( D ) can be written ase ( D &gt; = [ $ N ( D ) ] K u ( D ) ?where u(D) = Cy=ouiDi is a polynomial with rational-valued coefficients.Proof-Let i ( k ) denote the factorial power of i, for0 I k I i , defined by k -1 i ( k ) = n ( i -j ) , I s k s i , j = O and, by convention, Using the Sterling number identity (see, for example, i(O) = 1 and i(k) = 0, k &lt; 0. Knuth [41, p. 28211, we can express i k as a linear combination of the factorial powers of order k or less, It follows that the order-k moments of e can be written in the form k Mjk)( e) = ajDiecn( 0) , evaluated at D = w , j = O where e(j)(D) is the jth formal derivative with respect to D of the difference polynomial e(D). A straightforward induction shows that the order-k moments, for k = 0,. . -, K -1, vanish if and only if e(j)(D) has a zero at D = w for j = 0,e , K -1. Standard factorization arguments then imply that e(j)(D) is divisible by (1 -GD)K-j in the case of complex-valued symbols, or in the rational-valued case. An application of Theorem 3 completes the proof. 0 In analogy to Lemma 3 of [53], we now characterize algebraically the set of frequencies at which order-K spectral nulls can be achieved simultaneously. Proposition 2: If a finite-state code with rational symbol alphabet has an order-K spectral null at f = M / N T , where gcd(M, N ) = 1, then it also has an order-K spectral null at frequencies f = M ' / N T for all M' satisfying gcd(M', N ) = 1. Proof-By Theorems 1-3, we h o w that for any difference event e, generated by a cycle of length rN (that is, a multiple of N ) , MJk)( e) = n ikwlei = 0 , for k = 0, * * , K -1. i = O Define y!k) = ikei. Then Y ( ~) ( D ) = Cf=oyi(k)Di is a polynomial with rational coefficients having w as a zero. It follows that Y ( ~) ( D ) is divisible by the cyclotomic polynomial $N(D), which has zeros at wM for positive integers M' less than, and relatively prime to N . The proposition then follows from another application of Theorem 3.</figDesc></figure>
