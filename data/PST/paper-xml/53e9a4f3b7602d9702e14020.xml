<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>One of the most influential contributions of Anthony Downs's An Economic Theory of Democracy to the economic modelling of politics is the concept of "rational ignorance." Given that each individual voter has a negligible probability of affecting the outcome in a large election, voters will not have an incentive to acquire political information before voting. In a situation in which discovering their interests or "true views" takes time and effort from individual citizens, the result may be a failure of democracy to produce a result consistent with the interests of the majority. In Downs's words, If all others express their true views, he [the voter] gets the benefit of a well-informed electorate no matter how well-informed he is; if they are badly informed, he cannot produce those benefits himself. Therefore, as in all cases of individual benefits, the individual is motivated to shirk his share of the costs: he refuses to get enough information to discover his true views. Since all men do this, the election does not reflect the true consent of the governed. <ref type="bibr">[8, p. 246]</ref> We can actually draw a distinction between two versions of the rational ignorance hypothesis. The "weak version" is that individual voters, realizing that each vote has a negligible probability of affecting the outcome of the election, invest very little or no effort in acquiring political information. The "strong version" is that the election outcome itself will not be more likely to reflect the interests of the majority than, say, a fair coin toss. In this paper, we develop a formal model that is consistent with the weak version of the rational ignorance hypothesis, but contradicts the strong version.</p><p>A good deal of the literature on the influence activities of interest groups assumes that a decisive fraction of the electorate is uninformed because individual voters have little incentive to get political information (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for an explicit discussion). Becker <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> argues that efficiency may be restored in the voting market because of the activity of influence groups. Coate and Morris <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> point out that the re-election motive may induce incumbent politicians to behave efficiently unless voters are uncertain about politicians' types. (In their view, and Becker's, efficiency does not mean that transfers from the majority to interest groups do not occur; it only means that those transfers are carried out with minimum dead weight costs.) Closer to our point, Wittman <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> calls into question the idea that the costs of information fall on the voter instead of on political entrepreneurs.</p><p>We provide a different rationale for elections to reflect the interests of the majority. In our model, there are no interest groups or active politicians. Voters do not have access to free information. Instead, they may acquire some information, at a cost. Crucially, acquiring poor information is cheap. We show that, as the number of voters increases, voters acquire less and less information. However, there is an equilibrium sequence such that along the sequence the outcome of the election is very likely to correspond to the interests of a majority of voters. Thus, the electorate may be quite well-informed even if individual voters are (at least asymptotically) rationally ignorant.</p><p>We study an election in which voters have common preferences, but they do not know which of two alternatives is better for them. Voters may acquire a costly signal about the alternatives. The signal is correct with probability 1  2 + x, where x is chosen by the voter. We refer to x as the quality of the signal. The cost of acquiring the signal is given by some convex function C(x). Our first three theorems describe information acquisition and aggregation under the assumption that voters would be indifferent between the alternatives if they were to decide solely on the basis of their prior beliefs.</p><p>Theorem 1 shows that, if C (0) = 0, then there is an equilibrium in which the quality of information acquired by voters is positive for an arbitrarily large electorate. In agreement with the weak version of the rational ignorance hypothesis, individual investment in information approaches zero as the size of the electorate increases.</p><p>Theorem 2 provides an estimate of the limit probability of choosing the best alternative along the sequence of equilibria in which voters acquire some information. If C (0) &lt; ∞, this probability is strictly larger than 1  2 . Moreover, this probability goes to one as C (0) approaches zero, or as the importance attached by voters to the election grows unboundedly.</p><p>If C (0) = 0, the limit probability of choosing the best alternative is actually one. Successful information aggregation is possible because the information acquired by each voter goes to zero but it does so slowly enough to allow the effect of large numbers to kick in.</p><p>It is reasonable to believe that voters are involuntarily exposed to a flow of political information in the course of everyday activities-a point already acknowledged by Downs <ref type="bibr">[8, p. 245]</ref>, who relies on the unwillingness of voters to assimilate even freely available information in order to support the rational ignorance hypothesis. If the function C simply reflects the cost of "paying a little attention," the conditions for at least partially successful information aggregation, that is C (0) = 0 and C (0) &lt; ∞, do not appear unduly restrictive.</p><p>Theorem 3 establishes that the aggregate cost of information acquisition declines to zero as the number of voters increases if C (0) = C (0) = 0. If C (0) = 0 and C (0) &gt; 0, then the aggregate cost converges to a positive constant. Combining Theorems 2 and 3, we obtain that the equilibrium with information acquisition is asymptotically efficient if C (0) = C (0) = 0. Moreover, universal or near universal participation in elections is desirable in that case. However, if C (0) = 0 and C (0) &gt; 0, the equilibrium with information acquisition is not asymptotically efficient, and the optimal size of the electorate may be small in relation to the size of the society.</p><p>Political information in our model is a public good. As in other instances of privately provided public goods, there is an incentive to free ride on other voters, and in fact voters underinvest in political information in relation to a symmetric optimal profile. In the traditional problem of private provision of public goods in large economies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the marginal cost of contributing is constant, and the contributions of others reduce the marginal utility of additional units of the public good up to the point where it does not compensate most agents to contribute. In our model, the marginal cost is small for small contributions. The marginal benefit of contributing is positive because the probability of being pivotal is nonzero, though it decreases with the number of voters. Opposite to what happens in the traditional problem, approximate efficiency can be obtained in the limit.</p><p>Next, we relax the assumption that voters are ex ante indifferent between the alternatives. Theorem 4 shows that the previous results hold as long as the asymmetry in prior beliefs and preferences is small or C (0) is close enough to zero. In equilibria with information acquisition, voters randomize between acquiring information and voting according to the signal received, or acquiring no information and voting for the alternative favored ex ante. The beliefs of voters, conditional on being decisive, are kept very close, so that very little information can change the behavior of voters at the booth. This, in turn, makes voters to be willing to acquire vanishingly little information.</p><p>Theorems 5 and 6, finally, deal with a situation in which voters' preferences are heterogeneous. In that case, the fraction of voters who acquire information goes to zero as the size of the electorate increases. This is reminiscent of the work by Feddersen and Pesendorfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Feddersen and Pesendorfer show that the fraction of "swing" voters who use their private information in order to decide whom to vote for declines to zero in large elections. Our model shows that the quality of information acquired by (individual) swing voters also declines to zero. However, the best alternative is chosen with probability strictly larger than 1  2 as long as C (0) = C (0) = 0, and with probability approaching one as long as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C (0) = C (0) = C (0) = 0.</formula><p>These conditions are considerably more stringent than those that apply when voters have common preferences. Intuitively, we are a step closer to the traditional problem of public good provision in that most voters do not contribute to a better informed electorate. Taken together, our results support the idea that elections serve the interests of the majority better than what the rational ignorance hypothesis would seem to indicate at first glance, at least if swing voters have common preferences. They suggest that models of public opinion that take into account the production of information by the media, interest groups, and the like, can be enriched by considering the aggregate implications of voters investing some small (but positive) effort in costly information processing.</p><p>Our model is related to the literature on information aggregation in elections inspired by Condorcet's jury theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. This literature typically assumes that there is some information dispersed among the voters, while in our paper the distribution of information arises endogenously through the actions of voters. As a consequence, we obtain that larger electorates are beneficial for society in some circumstances, but not in others. (Lack of information aggregation in large elections is obtained also by Yariv <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> in a context in which private signals carry less information as the electorate grows, and by Razin <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in a context in which voters use their vote as a message to influence the policy of the winning candidate.)</p><p>Recently, Mukhopadhaya <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and Persico <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have proposed other models of endogenous information in collective decision making. In their models, the quality of the signal is given; voters can either acquire or not acquire information. As a consequence, in their models it is not possible to have arbitrarily large numbers of voters acquiring arbitrarily poor information. Persico, in particular, is concerned with the optimal design of committees, i.e. the optimal selection of committee size and voting rule in situations in which large elections are inefficient, while we concern ourselves with the endogenous production and aggregation of information in situations in which large elections may be asymptotically efficient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The model</head><p>We analyze an election with two alternatives, A and B. There are 2n + 1 voters (i = 1, . . . , 2n + 1). A voter's utility depends on the chosen alternative d ∈ {A, B}, the state z ∈ {z A , z B }, and the quality of information acquired by the voter before the election x ∈ [0, 1  2 ]. Acquiring information of quality x has a utility cost given by C(x), so the utility of a voter can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U(d, z) -C(x).</formula><p>At the beginning of time, nature selects the state. The prior probability of state z A is q A ∈ (0, 1) and the prior probability of state z B is q B = 1q A . Voters are uncertain about the realization of the state. After the realization of the state, each voter must decide the quality of her information. After deciding on x, the voter receives a signal s ∈ {s A , s B }. The probability of receiving signal s A in state z A is equal to the probability of receiving signal s B in state z B and is given by 1  2 + x. That is, the likelihood of receiving the "right" signal is increasing in the quality of information acquired by the voter; if the voter acquires no information the signal is uninformative. Signals are private information. The election takes place after voters receive their signals. A voter can either vote for A or vote for B. (That is, there are no abstentions.) The alternative with most votes is chosen.</p><p>We assume</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">U(A, z A ) -U(B, z A ) = r A &gt; 0 and U(B, z B ) -U(A, z B ) = r B &gt; 0.</formula><p>That is, A is the "right" alternative in state z A and B is the "right" alternative in state z B .</p><p>The cost function C is strictly increasing, strictly convex, and twice continuously differentiable on (0, 1  2 ). We assume that C(0) = 0, so that acquiring no information is costless. Note that C (0) ∈ [0, ∞). If C (x) grows unboundedly as x goes to zero, we use the notation</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C (0) = ∞. Thus, C (0) ∈ [0, ∞].</formula><p>We may prefer to think of the probability of receiving the right signal as a function 1  2 +m(e) of some underlying "effort level" by the voter with utility cost (e). In that case, the quality of information x is defined as m(e), and the cost of information C is defined as • m -1 . C satisfies the assumptions of the model if m is concave and is convex (one of them strictly so), and both are strictly increasing and twice continuously differentiable on (0, e) for some e &gt; 0, with (0) = m(0) = 0 and m(e) 1  2 . Intuitively, the requirements on C are satisfied if the marginal productivity of a voter's effort in the acquisition of information is constant or diminishing, and the marginal cost of effort is increasing. Note that we can always recover the effort level associated to a given information quality by using the one-to-one relation e = m -1 (x).</p><p>After describing the environment, we turn now to the description of strategies and the definition of equilibrium in the model. A pure strategy is a triple (x, v A , v B ), where x ∈ [0, 1  2 ] specifies a quality of information, v A ∈ {A, B} specifies which alternative to vote for after receiving signal s A , and v B ∈ {A, B} specifies which alternative to vote for after receiving signal s B . A mixed strategy for voter i is a probability distribution i over the set of pure strategies.</p><p>A voting equilibrium ( i = for all i) is a symmetric Nash equilibrium. An equilibrium with information acquisition is a voting equilibrium such that the equilibrium distribution assigns positive probability to the set of pure strategies with x &gt; 0.</p><p>Obviously, there are at least two equilibria without information acquisition: for every voter to adopt the pure strategy (0, A, A) with probability one, and for every voter to adopt the pure strategy (0, B, B) with probability one. In either case, the probability that a single voter is decisive is zero, so it is a best response to acquire no information and vote for the alternative favored by every other voter. In fact, as long as q A r A = q B r B or C (0) = 0, there is no other equilibrium without information acquisition. If voters adopt any other mixed strategy without information acquisition, the probability that a single voter is decisive is positive and the same in both states. But then, if, say, q A r A &gt; q B r B , the pure strategy (0, A, A) has a higher payoff than any other pure strategy with x = 0. If, instead, q A r A = q B r B and C (0) = 0, it is a best response for a voter to acquire some information with probability one. (See the proof of Theorem 1.) We focus on equilibria with information acquisition in the remainder of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Rational ignorance</head><p>For the ease of presentation, from here to Section 5 we consider the case in which q A r A = q B r B , so that neither alternative is favored by prior beliefs and preferences. The following theorem states that C (0) = 0 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an equilibrium with information acquisition in a large election, and characterizes this equilibrium.</p><p>Theorem 1. (i) If C (0) = 0 and q A r A = q B r B , there is an equilibrium with information acquisition, and it is unique within the class of equilibria with information acquisition. The equilibrium strategy gives probability one to the pure strategy (x * , A, B), where x * solves</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">2 2n n 1 4 -x 2 n q A r A = C (x). (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>(ii) If C (0) &gt; 0, there is some n such that for every n n (holding the other parameters of the model constant) there is no equilibrium with information acquisition.</p><p>(The proof of this and other results in the paper is in the Appendix.) Intuitively, if a pure strategy with information acquisition is played with positive probability in equilibrium, then it must equate the marginal cost with the marginal benefit of acquiring information. The marginal benefit of acquiring information, in turn, is equal to the sum of the probabilities of being decisive, conditional on each state being realized, multiplied by the utility gain in choosing the right alternative. A voter is decisive if n other voters vote for A and n other voters vote for B. Since the probability of this event converges uniformly to zero as the size of the electorate increases for any symmetric strategy profile, it follows that there cannot be an equilibrium with information acquisition for n large enough if C (0) &gt; 0. Therefore, C (0) = 0 is a necessary condition for the existence of equilibria with information acquisition in large elections.</p><p>To check that C (0) = 0 is also sufficient whenever q A r A = q B r B , consider a symmetric strategy profile in which every voter adopts a pure strategy (x, A, B) (with x &gt; 0) with probability one. Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">1</ref>) equates the marginal benefit with the marginal cost of acquiring information for that strategy profile. In particular, the probability of being decisive for that profile is the same for both states and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">2n n ( 1 2 + x) n ( 1 2 -x) n = 2n n 1 4 -x 2 n .</formula><p>As explained in the proof, the other equilibrium requirement is that the pure strategy with information acquisition played with positive probability in equilibrium must have a higher or equal payoff than the pure strategies of acquiring no information and voting for a fixed alternative. This requirement is easily verified if q A r A = q B r B .</p><p>As described in the previous section, we can consider C as composed from two more primitive functions, and m, representing respectively the utility cost of effort and the gain in information quality as a function of effort. Since C (x) = (e)/m (e) for x = m(e), it follows that C (0) = 0 iff either (0) = 0 or m (0) = ∞. Thus, Theorem 1 states that there is a equilibrium with information acquisition in large elections if and only if the marginal Table <ref type="table">1</ref> The quadratic example C(x) = 5x 2 ; q A r A = q B r B = The cubic example utility cost of effort is arbitrarily small for small effort, or if the marginal productivity of a voter's effort in the acquisition of information is arbitrarily large for small effort. Intuitively, we can think of the voter as having access to a wealth of useful information in exchange for exercising a little effort in paying attention. Let x n represent the value of x * for a given n. Since the left-hand side of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">1</ref>) converges to zero as n goes to infinity for any sequence of x ∈ [0, 1  2 ], x n converges to zero as n goes to infinity. Note that in the equilibrium with information acquisition the probability of reaching the right decision is the same in both states and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">C(x) = 33 1 3 x 3 ; q A r A = q B r B =</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">2n+1 m=n+1 2n + 1 m ( 1 2 + x n ) m ( 1 2 -x n ) 2n+1-m .</formula><p>Though x n goes to zero, this probability may not go to 1 2 since the number of terms in the summation increases with n. That is, the strong version of the rational ignorance hypothesis may fail even if the weak version holds, as suggested by the examples below.</p><p>Consider this quadratic example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C(x) = 5x 2 and q A r A = q B r B = 1 2 .</formula><p>The second column of Table <ref type="table">1</ref> gives us the values of x n for different electorate sizes (2n + 1), including the case of a single decision-maker. The third column gives us the probability of reaching the right decision. Though this probability decreases with n, it seems to converge to 0.56262. The aggregate cost of information acquisition, (2n + 1)C(x n ), also decreases with n and it seems to converge around 0.031. Now consider this cubic example: C(x) = 33 1 3 x 3 and q A r A = q B r B = 1 2 , illustrated by Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. In contrast with the previous example, the probability of reaching the right decision seems to approach one. Though initially increasing, the aggregate cost is eventually decreasing in the electorate size. The next section reveals that these examples are, in fact, representative of general results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Information acquisition in large elections</head><p>In this section we analyze the limiting properties of the sequence of equilibria with information acquisition obtained by increasing the size of the electorate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Information aggregation</head><p>We investigate here the limit probability of reaching the right decision. If</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C (0) = c ∈ (0, ∞), let k be the solution to 2 √ 2 (2 √ 2k) q A r A = kc. (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>(We use to denote the standard normal density and to denote the standard normal distribution function.) Note that k is strictly decreasing in c and grows unboundedly as c goes to zero. For the sake of completeness, we define k = ∞ if C (0) = 0 and k = 0 if C (0) = ∞, and we use the convention (∞) = 1. As we will see below, k is an indicator of the information held by the electorate in large elections. We have Theorem 2. Assume C (0) = 0 and q A r A = q B r B . Along the sequence of equilibria with information acquisition, the probability of choosing the right alternative converges to</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(2 √ 2k). In particular, it converges to one if C (0) = 0.</formula><p>The first part of the proof of Theorem 2 establishes that n 1/2 x n goes to k as n goes to infinity. To provide an intuition, we can obtain from Eq. (1), using a Taylor approximation in the right-hand side and a Stirling approximation in the left-hand side,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">2q A r A -1/2 n -1/2 (1 -4x 2 n ) n ≈ x n C (0).</formula><p>Rearranging,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">2q A r A -1/2 [1 -4(n 1/2 x n ) 2 /n] n ≈ n 1/2 x n C (0).</formula><p>Using an approximation (for large n and fixed n 1/2 x n ) for the term in brackets on the left-hand side we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">2q A r A -1/2 exp{-4(n 1/2 x n ) 2 } ≈ n 1/2 x n C (0).</formula><p>If C (0) = 0, this expression cannot hold unless n 1/2 x n goes to +∞; otherwise the righthand side goes to zero and the left-hand side remains bounded away from zero. If C (0) = c ∈ (0, ∞), k ∈ (0, ∞) can be obtained directly from the expression above. With respect to the rest of the proof, note that a voter votes for the right alternative with probability equal to 1  2 + x n . Thus, the expected number of votes for the right alternative of (2n + 1)( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">1</ref>2 + x n ) and the variance is</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">(2n + 1)( 1 4 -x 2 n ).</formula><p>A normal approximation to the probability of the right alternative winning the election would give us</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">⎛ ⎜ ⎝- n -(2n + 1)( 1 2 + x n ) (2n + 1)( 1 4 -x 2 n ) ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ .</formula><p>Taking limits, we get (2 √ 2k). A "naive" application of the central limit theorem as described is not really appropriate because the distribution representing the decision of a given voter changes with the electorate size. Instead, we use a normal approximation result for finite samples, the Berry-Esseen theorem.</p><p>We can interpret Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">2</ref>) as a "first order condition" at infinity if C (0) = 0, C (0) = c ∈ (0, ∞) and q A r A = q B r B . To see this, if every voter acquires some information, the expected utility of voter i (up to a positive affine transformation) is approximately</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">⎛ ⎜ ⎝ (2n + 1)x (2n + 1)( 1 4 ) ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ (2q A r A ) -cx 2 i /2,</formula><p>where x is the average quality acquired by the 2n + 1 voters and x i the information quality acquired by voter i. Maximizing this expression with respect to x i we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">2(2n + 1) -1/2 (2(2n + 1) 1/2 x)(2q A r A ) = x i c, or for large n, √ 2 (2 √ 2n 1/2 x)(2q A r A ) ≈ n 1/2 x i c. Eq. (2) follows from k ≈ n 1/2 x i = n 1/2 x.</formula><p>To illustrate Theorem 2, note that for the quadratic example we can calculate k as 0.055723. In fact, in this example 5000 1/2 x 5000 =0.055721 and 50000 1/2 x 50000 =0.055723. Moreover, the limit probability of society making the right decision is 0.56262. Thus, Theorem 2 provides an excellent approximation for the quadratic example with 10,000 voters or more. For the cubic example, k = +∞, and the limit probability of society making the right decision is one. With 100,000 voters we are still some way off the limit.</p><p>In terms of the decomposition of C in and m, we have that 3   for x = m(e). Thus, the condition for the society making the right decision with probability one in the limit, C (0) = C (0) = 0, is obtained if m (e) and (e) are uniformly bounded and, in addition, either (0) = (0) = 0 or m (0) = ∞. A result related to Theorem 2 is that elections with information acquisition will tend to be very close. Define the winning margin to be a random variable representing the difference between the number of votes for the winner and the number of votes for the loser, divided by 2n + 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The cost of information</head><p>We turn now to the cost of information acquisition in large elections. The following theorem gives us an estimate of the aggregate cost of information acquisition ((2n+1)C(x n )) in large elections. Theorem 3. Assume C (0) = 0 and q A r A = q B r B . If C (0) = c ∈ (0, ∞), then the aggregate cost converges to ck 2 along the sequence of equilibria with information acquisition as the size of the electorate increases. If either C (0) = 0 or C (0) = ∞, the aggregate cost converges to zero.</p><p>To see this, note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">lim n→∞ {(2n + 1)C(x n )} = 2 lim n→∞ {(n 1/2 x n ) 2 C(x n )/x 2 n }.</formula><p>If C (0) = c ∈ (0, ∞), the statement of the theorem follows from n 1/2 x n → k (from the proof of Theorem 2) and C(x n )/x 2 n → c/2 (by L'Hôpital's rule).

An argument in the Appendix (similar to the proof of Theorem 2) shows that in fact the aggregate cost converges to 0 if either C (0) = 0 or C (0) = ∞.</p><p>To illustrate this result, in the quadratic example we can compute ck 2 = 0.03105, so that we have an excellent approximation with 10,000 voters or more.

Social welfare in the information acquisition equilibrium is given by 94,869. The optimal symmetric profile would prescribe x around 0.008 which yields a social welfare of 99,999, very close to the upper bound, 100,001.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">The optimal size of the electorate</head><p>Consider a society with N members, where N is an odd number. If the society gets to choose the size of the electorate 1 2n + 1 N , anticipating that the voters will play the information acquisition equilibrium, what would be the optimal choice? We now let n = 0 represent the choice of a single decision-maker.</p><p>Since per capita social welfare converges to its upper bound q A r A + q B r B as the size of the electorate increases whenever C (0) = C (0) = 0 and q A r A = q B r B , it follows that under those conditions for a large society the optimal size of the electorate is either the size of the society or near it. That is, universal suffrage is at least nearly optimal. Moreover, under the (quite mild) condition C ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">1</ref>2 ) &gt; 2q A r A , guaranteeing that a single decision-maker would not acquire perfect information, social welfare under universal suffrage is larger than under delegation to a small committee for a large society. In the cubic example, for instance, a society with 100,001 members would find that social welfare is increasing in participation in elections.</p><p>Universal suffrage, however, is not necessarily nearly optimal if C (0) = 0 and C (0) &gt; 0. In the quadratic example, for instance, a society with 100,001 members would be better off by delegating the decision on a single person rather than holding elections. If we replace the cost function in this example with C(x) = 5x 2 if x 0.02, -0.0008 + 0.12xx 2 + 100x 3 if x 0.02, then the society would be better off by delegating the decision on a committee with eleven members.

A sufficient condition for a single-decision maker to be optimal in a large society is q A r A C (0) &lt; 2q A r A ; in this case the free-riding problem is so severe that committee members would not acquire any information. If C (0) &lt; q A r A , then, as in the previous case, the optimal size of the electorate depends on the shape of the cost function away from 0.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Asymmetric preferences</head><p>In this section we relax the assumption that q A r A = q B r B . As it turns out, if C (0) = 0 a (mixed strategy) information acquisition equilibrium exists in large elections, and perfect information aggregation and zero aggregate costs are obtained in the limit regardless of any asymmetry in preferences (and prior beliefs). However, if C (0) &gt; 0, an information acquisition equilibrium in a large election exists if and only if the asymmetry in preferences is moderate.</p><p>If q A r A = q B r B , adopting with probability one the pure strategy that equates the marginal benefit and cost of acquiring information (as in Section 3) cannot be an equilibrium for n large enough. For this strategy profile, beliefs about the states, conditional on being pivotal, are equal to prior beliefs, and hence independent of n. It is easy to check that this establishes a lower bound, independent of n, on the information that a voter is willing to acquire. Intuitively, if prior beliefs favor voting for A, a voter will acquire costly information only if after receiving a signal favoring B, her posterior beliefs about the states change enough to induce the voter to vote for B. However, the information acquired by each voter must converge to zero as n increases. The solution to this difficulty consists in allowing voters to randomize between the pure strategy of voting for the alternative favored by preferences and the pure strategy of acquiring information and voting according to the signal received. Under this mixed strategy, beliefs about the states conditional on being decisive remain close enough to make it worth acquiring vanishingly little information.</p><p>The difficulty alluded above when q A r A = q B r B is a simple illustration of a classic result by Radner and Stiglitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> on the nonconcavity of the value of information. Radner and Stiglitz show that it is unprofitable to acquire "very little" information when there is a decision that is favored by prior beliefs, and posterior beliefs and the payoff from the corresponding optimal decision vary continuously with the amount of information. In our setup, however, what matters for voters are not their prior beliefs over the states, but their beliefs about the states conditional on being decisive.

This is necessary to keep voters acquiring arbitrarily little information. Inequality <ref type="bibr">(3.3)</ref> allows us to show that if there is a "limit" equilibrium, given by a solution to (3.1)-(3.2), then there is actually an information acquisition equilibrium for large n. 1  Though the equilibria with information acquisition described in case (ii) are asymptotically inefficient, they yield a higher social welfare than any equilibria without information acquisition.

If the voting rule requires less than n+1 votes to choose A, then the ratio of the probability of being pivotal in state z A to the probability of being pivotal in state z B would fall below 1  2 for any given symmetric pure strategy profile (x, A, B). This is potentially important if C (0) = 0 and C (0) &gt; 0, as in this case information acquisition equilibria under simple majority are asymptotically inefficient or may even fail to exist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Heterogenous preferences</head><p>In this section we modify the model to allow for heterogeneous preferences among voters. In particular, we assume that, for each voter i, U i (A, z A ) = u i , where u i is a random variable uniformly distributed over [0, 1]. The remaining preference parameters are given by U i (B, z B ) = 1u i and U i (A, z B ) = U i (B, z A ) = 0. The random variables {u i } are independently distributed (from each other, from the distribution of the state, and from the distribution of signals about the state). The utility of voter i can be written now as U i (d, z) -C(x). We keep the assumptions about the cost of information acquisition from Section 2, and we add that C is thrice continuously differentiable. Each voter decides how much information to acquire after learning privately the realization of the preference parameter u i . As in Section 2, the election takes place after voters receive their signals about the state z ∈ {z A , z B }. For simplicity, we assume q A = q B = 1</p><p>2 . An action in the model with heterogenous preferences is defined as a triple (x, v A , v B ), where x ∈ [0, 1  2 ] specifies a quality of information, v A ∈ {A, B} specifies which alternative to vote for after receiving signal s A , and v B ∈ {A, B} specifies which alternative to vote for after receiving signal s B .

Theorems 5 and 6 are reminiscent of similar results by Feddersen and Pesendorfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In a model with free information and heterogeneous preferences, they show that a vanishing fraction of voters takes into account their private information when casting a vote. However, perfect information aggregation is obtained in the limit. In our model, not only the fraction of swing voters but also the information acquired by each swing voter goes to zero.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Final remarks</head><p>In a setting in which acquiring political information is costly, we have shown that the electorate as a whole may be much better informed than individual voters. In some circumstances, a result analogous to Condorcet's jury theorem is upheld: increasing the size of the electorate improves social welfare even taking into account the voters' costs. In some other circumstances, though, Condorcet's contention about the superiority of larger electorates fails.</p><p>In the environment we study, a small deviation from rationality by voters-ignoring completely the effects of a single opinion-would have important negative effects on the responsiveness of collective decision making to the interests of the majority. Akerlof <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has approached the issue of rational ignorance from that perspective. However, deviations from strictly rational beliefs may be as likely to occur in the direction of overestimating the importance of a single opinion as in the direction of underestimating it. Voters may derive some satisfaction from the belief that their vote counts for more than it actually does, and overinvest in political information for that reason.</p><p>We have represented information acquisition by voters as a strictly individual endeavor. If voters can communicate their information to others before the election, if different voters have access to the same sources of information, or if sources of information compete for subscribers, strategic considerations will differ from those in the current framework in nontrivial ways. There is clearly a need for more formal research on the issue of endogenous production and aggregation of information in large elections, perhaps in connection with the recent interest in pre-election communication by privately informed voters <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, and our individualistic framework is meant as a first step. plus a term that does not depend on the action chosen by i. Note that this expected utility is a strictly concave function of x i . Thus, it is maximized by a unique choice of x i , say x . It follows that a best-responding voter plays at most one pure strategy with information acquisition with positive probability, the pure strategy (x , A, B). Moreover, the expected payoff of the pure strategy (0, A, B) is a convex combination of the expected payoffs of (0, A, A) and (0, B, B). It follows that if x &gt; 0, then (x , A, B) has a higher payoff than either (0, A, A) or (0, B, B). Moreover, if the expected payoffs of (0, A, A) and (0, B, B) are not equal, one of these pure strategies has a higher payoff than (0, A, B) and (0, B, A). Thus, if a best-responding voter plays an strategy with information acquisition, the support of this strategy is either (I) {(x , A, B)}, (II) {(x , A, B), (0, A, A)}, or (III) {(x , A, B), (0, B, B)}.</p><p>Since the term in brackets in the definition of G converges to zero for any sequence of symmetric strategy profiles (and is independent of x i ), x must be equal to 0 for n large enough if C (0) &gt; 0.

(13.1) and (13.2). Moreover, x I n (H ) and x I I n (H ) are positive, continuous in H, and converge to zero as n goes to infinity.</p><p>Note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">(( 1 2 + x)C (x) -C(x))/(( 1 2 -x)C (x) + C(x</formula><p>)) converges to one from above as x goes to zero. Thus, the RHS of (13.1) is smaller than the RHS of (13.2) for x close to zero. Since the LHS of (13.1) and (13.2) are equal for every x if H = 0, we get x I n (0) &gt; x I I n (0) for large n. We claim first that, under the conditions stated in part (i) of the theorem, for every H &gt; 0 there is some n such that x I (H ) &lt; x I I (H ) for n n. It follows that there is a sequence of solutions to (12.1)-(12.2) (i.e. a sequence of information acquisition equilibria) such that along that sequence /x converges to zero. To establish the claim it is sufficient to prove that for any H &gt; 0, for n large enough, the RHS is larger than the LHS of (13.1), evaluating them at x I I n (H ). That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">1 -4[(1 + H/2)x -H x 2 ] 2 1 -4[(1 -H/2)x -H x 2 ] 2 n &lt; q B r B q A r A ( 1 2 + x)C (x) -C(x) ( 1 2 -x)C (x) + C(x) , (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_58">)</formula><p>where x = x I I n (H ). Letting y n (H ) = n 1/2 x I I n (H ) and using the mean value theorem, we get from (13.2) (n)n 1/2 (1 -4[(1 -H/2)y n (H )/n 1/2 -H (y n (H )) 2 /n] 2 ) n = y n (H )( 1 2n )C ( n )/(q B r B ) for some n between zero and n -1/2 y H n . Following the steps of the first part of the proof of Theorem 2, we get y n (H ) → ∞. Using Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4 in Durrett <ref type="bibr">[10, p. 94</ref>], the LHS of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">14</ref>) is approximately exp{-8H (y n (H )) 2 } for large n. Thus, it converges to 0. Since the RHS of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">14</ref>) is bounded below by (q A r A )/(q B r B ), <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> is satisfied for large n. This establishes the claim. Now let xn and n denote the information acquired by each voter and the probability of playing the pure strategy (0, A, A) according to a sequence of equilibria with information acquisition in case (i) of the theorem. Using (12.1) and following the steps of the first part of the proof of Theorem 2, we get xn n 1/2 → ∞. A minor variation on the second part of the proof of Theorem 2 establishes that the probability of choosing the right alternative converges to one. Similarly, a minor variation on the proof of Theorem 3 establishes that the aggregate cost converges to zero.</p><p>Second, we claim that, under the conditions stated in part (ii) of the theorem, x I n (2) &lt; x I I n (2) for large n, so that there is an equilibrium satisfying x &gt; /2. To see this, letting k I I = lim n→∞ y n (2) from (13.2) we get k I I = 2 -1/2 q B r B /c. Since, for H = 2, the LHS of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">14</ref>) converges to exp{-16k 2 I I } and the RHS is bounded below by (q A r A )/(q B r B ), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">14</ref>) is satisfied for large n if Eq. ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) is satisfied, that is, if (3.1)-(3.3) has a solution. Now let xn and n denote the information acquired by each voter and the probability of playing the pure strategy (0, A, A) according to a sequence of information acquisition equilibria satisfying n / xn &lt; 2 in case (ii) of the theorem. Using (12.1)-(12.2) and following the steps of the first part of the proof of Theorem 2, we get xn n 1/2 → k and n n 1/2 → h .</p><p>Minor variations on the proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 establish the statement about social welfare in part (ii) of the theorem.</p><p>To prove part (iii) of the theorem, we proceed by contradiction. If C (0) = c ∈ (0, ∞) and there is a sequence { xn , n } that solves (12.1)-(12.2) for arbitrarily large n, then along that sequence we must get xn n 1/2 → k and n n 1/2 → h , where k , h solve (10.1)-(10.2). But this system is equivalent to (3.1)-(3.2). Finally, if C (0) = ∞, from (12.1) we get xn n 1/2 → 0. But using (12.1)-(12.2) we get exp{-4((1n ) xn n 1/2 + n n 1/2 /2) 2 } exp{-4((1n ) xn n 1/2n n 1/2 /2) 2 } → q B r B q A r A , which is impossible unless q A r A = q B r B .</p><p>Proof of Theorem 5. It is straightforward to show that there is no equilibrium with information acquisition for large n if C (0) &gt; 0. Assume C (0) = 0. It is easy to show that a best-responding voter will put probability zero on the set of actions {(x, v A , v B ) = (x, A, B) and x &gt; 0}. Thus, if all other voters put positive probability on the set of actions with x &gt; 0, the probability that a given voter is decisive, conditional on either state, will be positive. But then, if C (0) = 0, a best-responding voter will put probability zero on the actions (0, A, B) and (0, B, A). The reason is that if the realization of u i is such that the voter is indifferent between (0, A, A) and (0, B, B), then it will pay the voter to acquire some information. Thus, if C (0) = 0, an information acquisition equilibrium mapping can put positive probability only on the actions (0, A, A) and (0, B, B) and on the set {(x, A, B) : x &gt; 0}. It is easy to check that an information acquisition equilibrium mapping must order the action (0, B, B) for u i &lt; u and (0, A, A) for u i &gt; u for some pair u, u satisfying 0 &lt; u &lt; u &lt; 1. We claim that u = 1u. Suppose, e.g., u &gt; 1u. Then the probability that a voter is decisive in state z A would be larger than the probability the voter is decisive in state z B . But then if the voter is indifferent between acquiring information or playing (0, A, A) if u i = u, then the voter should prefer to acquire information if u i ∈ (1u, u). Since u = 1u, the probability of being decisive in an equilibrium with information acquisition is the same in both states. Denoting this probability P (piv) we get that for u i ∈ (u, u), the information quality chosen in equilibrium x must maximize</p><p>( 1 2 )P (piv)( 1 2 + x) -C(x). (Note that the specific realization of u i drops from the objective function because the probability of being decisive is the same in both states.) For a voter to be indifferent between acquiring information and playing (0, A, A) if u i = u, it is necessary that (u/2)P (piv) = ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">1</ref>2 )P (piv)( 1 2 + x) -C( x) or equivalently, u = 1 2 + x -2C( x)/P (piv).</p><p>Thus, x &lt; 1 2 . But then it must satisfy the first-order condition (by L'Hôpital's rule) we get that the expected aggregate cost converges to c k2 /4, as stated in the theorem. Other cases can be dealt with following the steps of the proof of Theorem 3.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>e)m (e) -(e)m (e))/(m (e))4  -3m (e)( (e)m (e) -(e)m (e))/(m (e))5   </figDesc></figure>

P (piv|z) represents the probability that a single vote is pivotal (i.e. decisive) in state z. Letting p (d|z) denote the probability that a voter votes for alternative d in state z, as induced by the strategy , we have</p><p>Since p (A|z)p (B|z) is bounded above by 1  4 , P (piv|z) is bounded above by (2n)!/ (2 2n n!n!), which converges to zero as n goes to infinity. Thus, the probability of being decisive in either state converges uniformly to zero for any sequence of symmetric strategy profiles as n goes to infinity. We use this fact throughout the proofs.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 1. It is easy to show that, for any x &gt; 0, the pure strategies (x, A, A), (x, B, B), and (x, B, A) are strictly dominated. Thus, for any pure strategy played in equilibrium with positive probability, x &gt; 0 implies v A = A and v B = B. Now, suppose that every voter other than i adopts the strategy . Then, the expected utility for voter i of adopting any pure strategy (x i , A, B) for x i 0 is given by</p><p>voter other than i adopts the proposed strategy,</p><p>and</p><p>The equilibrium conditions are</p><p>(for n large enough) and</p><p>It is easy to check that P (piv|z A ) &lt; P (piv|z B ), so that the last inequality cannot be satisfied if q A r A = q B r B . It follows that if q A r A = q B r B , there cannot be an equilibrium of type (II). A similar argument holds with respect to type (III).</p><p>Proof of Theorem 2.
