<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Recently, text-to-text pre-trained models like BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Lewis et al., 2020]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">T5 [Raffel et al., 2020]</ref> have emerged in the field of natural language generation (NLG). Their main idea is to capture the relationship among texts by reconstructing original sentences with the input of corrupted sentences. These models can achieve state-of-the-art performance in various NLG tasks via fine-tuning on downstream datasets.</p><p>Despite the success of text-to-text pre-trained models, it's challenging to directly apply them to few-shot NLG tasks because their performance can be largely restricted by the number of labeled data <ref type="bibr">[Chen et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020b]</ref>. Especially in the task of few-shot data-to-text generation, it's ?U / X denotes the corrupted structured data / texts. hard to learn the complex relationship between source structured data and target texts via limited labeled data <ref type="bibr">[Gong et al., 2020]</ref>. Existing works commonly continue pre-training on large amounts of structured data without corresponding texts for task adaption, aiming to enhance the model performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Gururangan et al., 2020]</ref>. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), this task-adaptive pre-training strategy appears between general pre-training and fine-tuning, whose purpose is to adapt general pre-trained models (such as BART) to specific tasks (such as data-to-text generation) using unlabeled task data <ref type="bibr">[Xing and Wan, 2021]</ref>. We argue that task-adaptive pretraining only captures the relationship among structured data but fails to explicitly model the alignment between structured data and texts, thereby restricting the model performance on the few-shot data-to-text generation tasks.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce self-training <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Scudder, 1965]</ref> as a better few-shot learner for data-to-text generation. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b), self-training is a teacher-student framework where the teacher model creates synthetic labels for the unlabeled data, and the student model is trained on the pseudo-labeled data constructed by the teacher model. Compared with task-adaptive pre-training, self-training explicitly models the relationship between structured data and texts by training the student model on the pseudo-labeled data generated by the teacher model, instead of solely conducting unsupervised pre-training on the unlabeled structured data. We argue that the main challenge falls into the quality of pseudolabeled data. Even if the teacher model is initialized with pre-trained models, it may generate low-quality texts especially when dealing with the structured data with complex topologies, which hurt the performance of the student model.</p><p>Thus, we present a novel method called Curriculum-Based Self-Training (CBST) to address the challenge. This method utilizes curriculum learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Bengio et al., 2009]</ref> to construct pseudo-labeled data from easy cases to hard ones, and leverages such data into the training process at different iterations. Specifically, we divide the unlabeled dataset into different subsets based on some difficulty metric such as the number of input triples <ref type="bibr">[Ribeiro et al., 2020b]</ref>. At each iteration, we first collect the unlabeled data that satisfy the difficulty metric of the current curriculum. Then, we generate synthetic texts for these data using the teacher model, and select the pseudo-labeled data based on the coverage and generation probability. Finally, we train the student model on the labeled data and the selected pseudo-labeled data, and make it act as the teacher model at the next iteration. This method is expected to gradually increase the difficulty of generating texts for unlabeled structured data and improve the quality of pseudo-labeled data constructed by the teacher model.</p><p>Our contributions are mainly as follows 1 :</p><p>? We introduce self-training to improve text-to-text pretraining for few-shot data-to-text generation. This method explicitly captures the relationship between structured data and texts by generating texts for unlabeled structured data with the teacher model and training the student model on the pseudo-labeled data.</p><p>? We propose a novel method called CBST to alleviate the side-effect of low-quality pseudo-labeled data, which introduces curriculum learning to effectively leverage the unlabeled structured data into the training process in the order determined by the difficulty metric.</p><p>? We conduct extensive experiments in the few-shot setting of WebNLG and WikiBio datasets. Results show that our method can outperform fine-tuning and taskadaptive pre-training methods, and achieve state-of-theart performance on these two benchmarks.</p><p>2 Related Work</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data-to-Text Generation</head><p>Early studies on data-to-text generation mainly focus on how to encode the structural information of input data better. Thus, researchers devise complex encoder structures based on sequential neural networks <ref type="bibr">[Trisedya et al., 2018]</ref> and graph neural networks <ref type="bibr">[Ribeiro et al., 2020b]</ref> to achieve 1 The codes are available at https://github.com/kepei1106/CBST. this goal. Recently, since text-to-text pre-trained models have shown promising performance in various NLG tasks, some works directly fine-tune these pre-trained models including BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Lewis et al., 2020]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">T5 [Raffel et al., 2020]</ref> on data-to-text datasets and report impressive results <ref type="bibr">[Ribeiro et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kale and Rastogi, 2020]</ref>. Other works adapt pre-trained models to data-to-text generation tasks by designing specific pre-training tasks such as reconstructing structured data and texts, which further improve the model performance in both supervised and few-shot settings of downstream datasets <ref type="bibr">[Chen et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ke et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xing and Wan, 2021]</ref>.</p><p>Compared with existing works, we introduce self-training to explicitly capture the relationship between structured data and texts, instead of solely relying on unsupervised taskadaptive pre-training.

Then we select the pseudo-labeled dataset D P L based on the coverage and generation probability of the teacher model. The student model f ? S which is also initialized with the pre-trained model f ?

In this paper, we choose the number of triples as the difficulty metric to segment the unlabeled dataset D U into M C subsets. This metric reflects the complexity of structures in the input data and has a significant impact on the quality of the generated texts <ref type="bibr">[Ribeiro et al., 2020b]</ref>.

Specifically, we choose the pseudo-labeled data where the proportion of subjects and objects appearing in the generated text is larger than ? cov and the generation probability of the text ranks top-? gen to construct the dataset for the student model training. Here, ? cov and ? gen are both hyper-parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Model Training</head><p>The goal of this module is to train the student model on the pseudo-labeled dataset and the labeled dataset. Initialized with the text-to-text pre-trained model f ? T 2T , the student model f ? S is trained with the following loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L S = 1 M ? M ? i=1 l(X gen i , NF(G U i ); f ? S ) + 1 m m i=1 l(X L i , G L i ; f ? S )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where NF(G) denotes the noise function perturbing the structured data G. Existing works show that input noise is beneficial for self-training because it increases the smoothness of the student model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[He et al., 2020]</ref>. Inspired by the existing works <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Jia et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hoyle et al., 2021]</ref>, we devise two-level noise functions as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, including word substitution at the semantic level and triple reordering at the structural level. Specifically, we substitute each word by its synonym with the probability p word and shuffle the order of triples in each sample with the probability p triple , where p word and p triple are hyper-parameters. These functions are expected to perturb the input structured data while largely keeping the semantic and structural information.</p><p>In practice, we adopt a separate training strategy which shows better performance than joint training <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[He et al., 2020]</ref>. This strategy first trains the student model on the pseudolabeled dataset D P L with the first term of L S , and then trains it on the labeled dataset D L with the second term.</p></div>

This dataset aims to generate textual descriptions for RDF triples <ref type="bibr">[Shimorina and Gardent, 2018]</ref>. The number of instances in training / validation / test set is 34,352 / 4,316 / 4,224, respectively. We followed the existing works <ref type="bibr">[Chen et al., 2020a]</ref> to pre-process this dataset and 0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10% of the training instances as the labeled datasets in the few-shot setting. WikiBio. This dataset aims to generate the first sentence of biography descriptions for Wikipedia tables <ref type="bibr">[Lebret et al., 2016]</ref>. The original split of the training / validation / test set is 582,658 / 2,000 / 72,831. We followed the existing works <ref type="bibr">[Chen et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020b]</ref> to pre-process this dataset and use 50, 100, 200, and 500 samples from the training dataset as the labeled datasets in the few-shot setting.</p><p>We further constructed the unlabeled dataset for each benchmark dataset based on GenWiki <ref type="bibr">[Jin et al., 2020]</ref>. This dataset consists of general-domain unpaired structured data and texts sharing the same content distribution. We directly removed the texts in this dataset, and filtered out the structured data that do not have the subjects and objects appearing in the corresponding labeled dataset. Thus, we obtained two unlabeled datasets for WebNLG and WikiBio, respectively, which contain 375,408 / 163,804 samples of structured data without annotated texts<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Implementation Detail</head><p>In our self-training algorithm, we set the number of curriculum M C to be 3. For both WebNLG and WikiBio datasets, we split the corresponding unlabeled dataset into 3 subsets which contain the structured data with (?2) / 3-4 / (?5) triples. For the hyper-parameters to select pseudo-labeled data, we set ? cov = 1.0, ? gen = 50%. The probabilities of word substitution and triple reordering were set to p word = p triple = 0.4.</p><p>As for the model structure, we used BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Lewis et al., 2020]</ref> as the text-to-text pre-trained model in our experiments. The base version of BART was adopted because of the limited computational resources. We followed BART to use Byte-Pair Encoding vocabulary with the size of 50,265.</p><p>The training epoch at each iteration was set to be 20. The learning rate was 0.00003. The batch size was 32 / 24 for WebNLG / WikiBio, respectively. The maximum length of linearized structured data was 256 / 384 for WebNLG / Wik-iBio, respectively, while the length of text sequences was 128.</p></div>

This category of baselines designs task-adaptive pre-training methods on unlabeled data before fine-tuning. We chose two representative pretraining tasks: 1) Sequence-level reconstruction (SeqRecon) from BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Lewis et al., 2020]</ref> which decodes complete linearized structured data when encoding corrupted structured data; 2) Graph-level reconstruction (GraphRecon) from JointGT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Ke et al., 2021]</ref> which predicts the masked tokens at the output layer of the encoder with the input of corrupted structured data. We denoted them as TAPT-SeqRecon and TAPT-GraphRecon, respectively.</p><p>For a fair comparison, we also used BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Lewis et al., 2020]</ref> as the text-to-text pre-trained model for task-adaptive pre-training baselines. We presented the results of our model CBST with two ablation models, i.e. curriculum learning from CBST, which is similar to noisy self-training <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[He et al., 2020]</ref>. The latter one simultaneously removes curriculum learning and input noise, which acts as vanilla self-training. All the results were presented with the average values over 3 runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Automatic Result</head><p>We followed the existing works <ref type="bibr">[Shimorina and Gardent, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020a]</ref> to adopt BLEU-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Papineni et al., 2002]</ref>, METEOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Banerjee and Lavie, 2005]</ref>, and ROUGE-L <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Lin, 2004]</ref> to evaluate the generated results on WebNLG, and use BLEU-4 as the metric on WikiBio.</p><p>The main results on WebNLG and WikiBio are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. We can observe that CBST significantly outperforms fine-tuning and task-adaptive pre-training methods in all the settings, which shows that our method can explicitly learn the relationship between structured data and texts via self-training and improve the model performance. The comparison between CBST and the ablation models indicates that curriculum learning can alleviate the problem of lowquality pseudo-labeled data and further improve the performance. The noise functions also contribute to the final performance by increasing the smoothness of our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Human Evaluation</head><p>To further evaluate the quality of generated results, we conducted human evaluation in the 1% setting of WebNLG. We followed the existing works <ref type="bibr">[Ribeiro et al., 2020b]</ref> to use two criteria: fluency (whether a sentence is grammatically fluent) and adequacy (whether a sentence clearly describes the structured data). We randomly sampled 100 structured data from the test set, and collected the generated results from CBST and other baselines. We adopted pairwise comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Ke et al., 2021]</ref> between CBST and other baselines. For each pair of generated texts (one from CBST and the other from the corresponding baseline, given the same input structured data), three annotators were hired to determine which text is better (i.e., win, lose or tie) in terms of the above metrics.</p><p>Results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> show that CBST can significantly outperform the baselines based on direct fine-tuning and taskadaptive pre-training in both fluency and adequacy. In addition, the improvement of CBST over two ablation models shows the effectiveness of our curriculum learning module and noise functions to generate fluent texts which describe structured data more clearly. We also calculated Fleiss' Kappa <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Fleiss, 1971]</ref> for each pairwise comparison to measure the agreement among different annotators, where the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> show moderate agreement (0.4 ? ? ? 0.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Ablation Study</head><p>We conducted a detailed ablation test to study the effects of different noise functions, selection criteria, and difficulty metrics. We removed each module respectively and presented the results on WebNLG (1%) in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. Note that w/ DiffLen denotes that we used the length of linearized structured data as the difficulty metric. Results in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> show that all the modules contribute to the final performance. As for two noise functions, the performance of CBST degrades more in the setting of removing word substitution, which perturbs structured data more flexibly. In terms of the selection criterion, both coverage and generation probability improve the quality of pseudo-labeled data and contribute to the final performance. We can also observe the performance drop when CBST used the length of linearized structured data as the difficulty metric, indicating that the number of input triples is a more proper metric to reflect the difficulty of text generation from structured data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Analysis on Pseudo-Labeled Data</head><p>To study whether our method can improve the quality of pseudo-labeled data via curriculum learning, we evaluated the quality of pseudo-labeled data generated by the teacher model at the last iteration before selection. We resorted to human evaluation since there is no annotated text for unlabeled structured data. We randomly sampled 100 unlabeled structured data and collected the generated results of the teacher models from CBST and the ablation models at the last iteration. Three annotators were hired to judge each generated text from the following fine-grained aspects: 1) Hallucination: whether the generated text includes non-existing facts; 2) Missing fact: whether the generated text misses input facts; 3) Fluency: the fluency score of generated texts (score 1-5 where 5 indicates fully fluent sentences).</p><p>We presented the fluency score and the proportions of generated results that belong to hallucination / missing fact in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>. Results show that curriculum learning in our method plays an important role in generating fluent and adequate texts to describe unlabeled structured data, resulting in better model performance. The relatively limited improvement on missing facts may be because our base model BART already has the strong ability to generate texts that appear in the input via its pre-training tasks based on text reconstruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.8">Analysis on Curriculum Learning</head><p>To further analyze how curriculum learning helps selftraining in few-shot data-to-text generation, we first demonstrated how the number of curriculum (M C ) affects the fi-  nal performance. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref> show that the best performance is reached at M C = 3. When M C is smaller, the teacher model needs to generate texts for unlabeled structured data with multiple triples at early iterations, which may degrade the quality of pseudo-labeled data and the final performance. In contrast, when M C is larger, the student model is trained on easy unlabeled data for many iterations and cannot utilize the hard cases until the late iterations, which may also affect the model performance.</p><p>Furthermore, we set M C = 3 and visualized the performance of the student model at each iteration in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Note that the values when the number of iterations equals 0 indicate the performance of direct fine-tuning. At early iterations, the two ablation models perform better because they directly incorporate the whole unlabeled dataset into self-training and acquire a larger pseudo-labeled dataset. However, the improvement of their performance is extremely limited at the second and third iterations since the low-quality texts generated by the teacher model at early iterations may restrict the model performance. For comparison, CBST only utilizes the unlabeled data that satisfy the difficulty metric at each iteration to avoid low-quality pseudo-labeled data. Despite the worse performance at early iterations due to the smaller number of unlabeled data included in the self-training process, CBST still obtains the best performance at the last iteration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We introduce self-training to improve text-to-text pre-trained models on few-shot data-to-text generation tasks, which can utilize unlabeled structured data to explicitly model the relationship between structured data and texts. To alleviate the problem of low-quality pseudo-labeled data during self-training, we further propose a novel method called Curriculum-Based Self-Training to rearrange the order of unlabeled data incorporated into self-training based on the difficulty metric. Experimental results show that CBST outperforms fine-tuning and task-adaptive pre-training methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the few-shot setting of WebNLG and WikiBio datasets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Comparison between task-adaptive pre-training and selftraining in few-shot data-to-text generation.
