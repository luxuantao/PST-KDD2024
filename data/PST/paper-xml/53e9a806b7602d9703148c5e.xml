<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The problem of optimal dynamic risk control/dividends distribution of a financial corporation has recently gained a lot of attention in Mathematical Finance. In the first papers such as Jeanblanc-Pique and Shiryaev <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Asmussen and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, dividend optimisation was considered. In other papers (see Browne <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Højgaard and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) only risk was controlled, with the dividend distribution scheme being exogenously fixed or with criteria related to other than dividends optimization. The most typical example of a financial corporation in this type of problems is an insurance company. By and large the risk control within an insurance company is maintained by a process called reinsurance. The reinsurance company receives from the primary insurance carrier (the cedent) a certain part of all premiums. In return it is obliged to pay a certain part of each claim according to an a priori established rule. In this paper we will treat one of the most common in the reinsurance industry cases of the excess-of-loss reinsurance. Within this scheme the cedent pays all of the claim up to a fixed amount a (the retention level), while all in excess of a is paid by the reinsurance company. The problem, which is faced by the cedent is how to chose dynamically in an optimal way the retention level a and the dividend distribution policy.</p><p>Let r(t) be the reserve of an insurance company at time t. Assume that the cumulative amount of dividends paid out by the company up to time t is L(t). Also at each time t the company applies some dynamic reinsurance rule governed by a parameter a(t). If c is the discount factor then how should the company choose L(t) and a(t) in order to maximize the total expected discounted value of all dividends ever paid out? That is, to maximize E τ 0 e -ct dL(t) (here τ ≤ ∞ is the ruin time). The case of proportional reinsurance arrangement where the retention level a(t) ∈ [0, 1] is the fraction of each claim carried by the cedent has been studied by Højgaard and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> (for the simpler case of no reinsurance, see Asmussen and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Jeanblanc-Pique and Shiryaev <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and references there within). One of the objectives of our studies in this paper is to compare the proportional reinsurance and the excess-of-loss reinsurance: which arrangement is more profitable? Our mathematical results and numerical examples will be formulated within the framework of controlled diffusion models, see e.g. Fleming and Rishel <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, for the purpose of motivation it is convenient to start from the classical Cramér-Lundberg model. In this model we have without reinsurance and dividend payments that the reserve of the company is given by R t = R 0 + pt -Nt process with intensity β representing the arrival times of the claims and the U i (the claim sizes) are i.i.d. with common distribution F having finite first and second moments µ ∞ , σ 2 ∞ (the use of this notation will later become clear). The premium rate p is assumed to be calculated via the expected value principle, i.e. p = (1 + η)βµ ∞ , <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref> where η &gt; 0 is the relative safety loading.</p><p>Let a be a (fixed) retention level and let U (a)   i denote the part of the claims held by the insurer. Assume the reinsuring company uses a safety loading proportional to η with proportionality factor k (a) depending only on a. Then the reserve of the cedent will be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R (a,η) t = u + p (a,η) t - Nt i =1 U (a) i , (1.2)</formula><p>where the premium rate is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p (a,η) = (1 + η)βµ ∞ -(1 + k (a)η)β[µ ∞ -EU (a) i ] = βEU (a) i + ηβ(µ ∞ -k (a)[µ ∞ -EU (a) i ])</formula><p>Then it can be shown, that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ηR (a,η) t/η 2 t≥0 D → BM µ(a), σ 2 (a) (1.3)</formula><p>in D[0, ∞) (the space of right continuous functions with left limits endowed with the Skorohod topology) as η ↓ 0, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">µ(a) = β(µ ∞ -k (a)[µ ∞ -EU (a) i ]), σ 2 (a) = βEU (a) 2 i (1.4)</formula><p>This limiting model can be suitable to apply at least in case of big portfolios.</p><p>Motivations for and relevant references on this and more complicated examples of diffusion approximations in risk theory can be found in Iglehart <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Grandell <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Emanuel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Harrison <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Asmussen <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Schmidli <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and Møller <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Throughout this paper we will only consider the case of cheap reinsurance, which corresponds to k (a) ≡ 1. In proportional reinsurance U (a) i = aU i so that with cheap reinsurance µ(a) = aµ ∞ and σ 2 (a) = a 2 σ 2 ∞ . Thus for a fixed a the diffusion process approximating the Cramér-Lundberg model is governed by the SDE dr(t) = aµ dt + aσ d w(t) <ref type="bibr">(1.5)</ref> where w(t) is standard Brownian motion. For a discussion of non-cheap reinsurance in a similar setting with k (a) ≥ 1, but independent of a, see Taksar and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and Højgaard and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In the case of excess-of-loss reinsurance, U (a) i = U i ∧ a so that (taking w.l.o.g. β = 1) we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">µ(a) = E[U (a) ] = a 0 F (x ) dx , (1.6) σ 2 (a) = E[(U (a) ) 2 ] = a 0 2x F (x ) dx (1.7)</formula><p>where F (x ) = P(U &gt; x ). Instead of (1.5) we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">dr(t) = µ(a) dt + σ(a) d w(t) . (1.8)</formula><p>We can now give a rigorous mathematical formulation of the problem. Let (Ω, F , P) be a probability space with filtration {F t } and let w(t) be a standard Brownian motion w.r.t. {F t }. An admissible control policy π is a twodimensional F t -adapted stochastic process (a π (t), L π (t)) where 0 ≤ a π (t) ≤ ∞ is the retention level at time t and L π (t) ≥ 0 is a non-decreasing right-continuous process whose value corresponds to the cumulative amount of dividends paid out up to time t. The controlled risk process {r π (t)} with initial reserve x is the solution of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">dr π (t) = µ(a π (t)) dt + σ(a π (t)) d w(t) -dL π (t) ,<label>(1.9</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r π (0) = x -L π (0) ,<label>(1.10)</label></formula><p>where µ(a), σ 2 (a) are given by (1.6), (1.7).

(1.</formula><p>12)</p><p>The objective is to find an optimal policy π * such that V (x ) = V π * (x ) for all x .</p><p>In the case of proportional reinsurance an explicit solution to this problem was found by Højgaard and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. A comparison of (1.5) and (1.8) indicates, however, that from the mathematical point of view the excess-of-loss reinsurance is a harder problem than proportional reinsurance: the functional relation between µ(a) and σ 2 (a) is much more complicated in <ref type="bibr">(1.8)</ref> than in (1.5) even for a relatively simple densities f such as the exponential. Accordingly, the solution we provide for the excess-of-loss reinsurance is less explicit than in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, nevertheless it is computationally tractable. We will see that the problem can be reduced to the solution of a free boundary problem to an ordinary differential equation, which in turn can be reduced to an ordinary differential equation with boundary conditions determined by the solution to a set of transcendental equations.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we consider the reparametrization of the problem obtained by taking µ (the drift term) as the basic control parameter. This is inspired by Radner and Shepp <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and is a key idea for the mathematical analysis. In Sect. 3, we prove that the excess-of-loss reinsurance is always better than the proportional one. Though simple to establish, this result is of a great practical interest. In Sect. 4 we prove that the optimal return function is always a concave function, which is essential for solving the optimization problem. Section 5 and 6 contain the derivation of the optimal excess-of-loss reinsurance policy π * in the case of unrestricted and restricted rates of dividend payments respectively. Here we need to distinguish between the situations of the distribution F having finite or infinite support. Section 7 is devoted to numerical examples, including numerical comparisons between the excess-of-loss reinsurance and the proportional one in different cases and Sect. 8 contains some closing remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Parameterization via µ</head><p>Due to monotonicity of F , it is obvious that µ(a) given by (1.6) is a continuous strictly increasing function of a ∈ (0, N ), where N = sup{y : F (y) &lt; 1} ≤ ∞, with µ(0) = 0 and µ(N ) = µ ∞ ≡ EU . As we will see later the qualitative nature of our results will depend on whether N &lt; ∞ or N = ∞.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">The optimal policy</head><p>If F has infinite support the retention level depends on the current reserve x and is equal to a * (x ) for x &lt; x 1 and equal to a * (x 1 ) for x &gt; x 1 . The dividend policy consists of paying out dividend at maximum rate M if the reserve exceeds x 1 .</p><p>If F has finite support, then we may reach maximum retention level N at some point x 0 ≤ x 1 if M is sufficiently large. For small M we will reach a constant level of retention at x 1 which is less than maximum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Numerical examples</head><p>In this section we make numerical calculations of the optimal return functions in the cases of claim size distributions being exponential with parameter 1 and uniform on [0, 1]. These are compared to the optimal return functions using proportional reinsurance (from Højgaard and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>) and using no reinsurance (from Asmussen and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). The following line types given in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, will be used throughout the section.</p><p>We need to notice for the excess-of-loss reinsurance the first part of the functions can only be approximated numerically, while the last part can be calculated explicitly. Therefore in some cases there may be some 'disturbances' at the switching points, due to the inaccuracy of the approximations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Unbounded rate of dividend</head><p>In this section we consider the case of unbounded rate of dividend and make calculations for different choices of discount rate c. Not surprisingly we see that differences between the three choices of reinsurance decreases as c increases.</p><p>Furthermore it is interesting to see, what is the maximum needed reserve x 1 under the different schemes, which is depicted in the following Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Bounded rate of dividend</head><p>In this case we fix the discount rate c = 0.1 and consider different cases of maximum rate of dividend pay-out M . Remark 7.1 Obviously the gain of choosing excess-of-loss reinsurance in the exponential case is larger than in the uniform case. This has a simple explanation. The reason for reinsurance is to lower the risk and as mentioned in Højgaard and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> a good measure of risk is σ 2 ∞ /µ ∞ . In the exponential case this equals 2 and in the uniform case it is 2/3. Excess-of-loss reinsurance is more efficient for risk avoidance and since the risk is larger in the exponential case, this efficiency becomes more clear in this case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Closing remarks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">The probability of ruin</head><p>From Karlin and Taylor <ref type="bibr">[19, p. 228]</ref> we know that the ruin probability under the optimal policy P(τ * &lt; ∞) = 0 if We have argued that W (z ) ∼ z -1/(1+2c) and if we at least choose c &lt; 1/2 we have S (x ) = ∞. This means that in the case of unrestricted rate of dividend, even though paying out dividends reflects the risk process at x 1 the presence of reinsurance prevents ruin. This is also the case with proportional reinsurance, see Højgaard and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, whereas in the absence of reinsurance, as treated in Asmussen and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, P(τ * &lt; ∞) = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Optimality of excess-of-loss reinsurance?</head><p>The result of Theorem 3.1, which states that you can always find an excess-ofloss reinsurance policy, which is better than proportional reinsurance policies, agrees with the result of Gerber <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which states that in the compound Poisson model with premium calculated by means of the expected value principle excess-of-loss reinsurance is the reinsurance form that maximizes the adjustment coefficient for the cedent. It can be shown, that this is not the case for other types of premium principles (see e.g. Hesselager <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), therefore a topic for further work would be to consider other premium principles. In general this is a complicated matter, but one example is trivial. Assume we use the variance principle (with cheap reinsurance), i.e. In this case our control parameter is the drift term µ(x ) = σ 2 (x ) and it is easily seen that the optimal choice is µ(x ) = µ ∞ , which correspond to no reinsurance at all and you get the solution of Asmussen and Taksar <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> with µ = σ 2 . This has an straightforward explanation: No matter which reinsurance form and which retention level one chooses, the measure of risk σ 2 (x )/µ(x ) = 1, so one might as well take full risk.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
