<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Modern neural language models widely used in tasks across NLP risk memorizing sensitive information from their training data. As models continue to scale up in parameters, training data, and compute, understanding memorization in language models is both important from a learning-theoretical point of view, and is practically crucial in real world applications. An open question in previous studies of memorization in language models is how to filter out "common" memorization. In fact, most memorization criteria strongly correlate with the number of occurrences in the training set, capturing "common" memorization such as familiar phrases, public knowledge or templated texts. In this paper, we provide a principled perspective inspired by a taxonomy of human memory in Psychology. From this perspective, we formulate a notion of counterfactual memorization, which characterizes how a model's predictions change if a particular document is omitted during training. We identify and study counterfactuallymemorized training examples in standard text datasets. We further estimate the influence of each training example on the validation set and on generated texts, and show that this can provide direct evidence of the source of memorization at test time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Modern neural language models (LMs) have achieved impressive results in generating high quality text <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown et al., 2020)</ref> and have led to breakthroughs in many downstream natural language processing tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Devlin et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Raffel et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bommasani et al., 2021)</ref>. The paradigm of taking a single large-scale pre-trained model and fine-tuning it for many tasks motivates the study of these models' ability to generalize by avoiding memorizing their training data. That is, our memorization definition compares the difference between two expected performance measures on a given example x. On one side, we compute the expected performance of a model when trained on datasets that contain the example x, and, on the other side, we compute the expected performance of a model when trained on datasets that do not contain the example x.</p><p>The expectations in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) can be empirically estimated via sampling. Specifically, we train m different models on independently sampled subsets S 1 , . . . , S m of equal size |S i | = r|D| for a fixed r ∈ (0, 1).</p><p>We then divide these models into two groups: the first group contains all models trained on subsets S where x ∈ S; and the second group are all models trained on subsets S where x ∈ S . We take the average performance on x in the two groups separately and compute the difference between the two:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">mem(x) mean i:x∈S i [M (A(S i ), x)] − mean i:x ∈S i [M (A(S i ), x)].</formula><p>(2)</p><p>This difference quantifies how the presence or absence of the example x in a model's training set affect the model's performance on x. If there is a large difference between including an example in the training set versus not including it, then we consider this example counterfactually memorized.</p><p>For each example x, we refer to models trained with x in the training set ({A(S i ) : x ∈ S i }) as IN models and the models x was not trained on ({A(S i ) : x ∈ S i }) as OUT models. Note we do not need to retrain a model for each example x. Instead, we train m models once, and can compute the estimation (eq 2) for all examples. Throughout this paper we use per-token accuracy as the measure M . In other words, we ask the model to predict the next token based on the preceding tokens, measure the 0-1 loss of the argmax token prediction, and then average it across all predicted tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Difference from Generation-Time Memorization</head><p>Many definitions of memorization operate at generation-time: a sequence of generated text is marked as memorized if a sufficient amount of overlap is found in the training dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carlini et al., 2020)</ref>. When the training data is not available, heuristic-based methods comparing language model perplexities are used to predict whether a generation contains memorized content <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carlini et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Thakkar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Thomas et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carlini et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zanella-Béguelin et al., 2020)</ref>. One difficulty with these approaches is that generation-time instances of memorization are strongly correlated with the number of similar or near-duplicate examples in the training set. As observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lee et al. (2021)</ref>, large clusters of near-duplicated examples do exist in common language datasets, dominating memorization detected in generated text. Generation-time methods for measuring memorization are forced to design heuristics to avoid simply identifying these uninteresting instances of memorization.</p><p>In contrast, the counterfactual memorization we study in this paper handles the issue of near-duplicates automatically without the need for heuristics. For a training example, x, with many near-duplicate copies in the training set, mem(x) will be small (because other samples x ≈ x will be present in the training dataset whether or not x is). This does not mean that counterfactual memorization is the opposite of generation-time memorization. An example, x, with high mem(x) may have a high chance of being generated if a model is appropriately prompted, despite and possibly because it is rare, and thus the example is considered memorized by both definitions. In summary, generation-time memorization measures how likely a trained model would directly copy from the training examples, while counterfactual memorization aims to discover rare information that is memorized.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experiment Setup</head><p>We estimate and analyze counterfactual memorization of training examples in several standard text datasets: RealNews <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zellers et al., 2019)</ref>, C4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Raffel et al., 2020b)</ref> and Wiki-40B:en <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Guo et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, we use Transformer-based language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> equivalent to T5-base <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Raffel et al., 2020a)</ref> with ∼112M parameters. To save computation and enable more direct comparisons across datasets, we truncate the training set for each datasets by taking the first 2 21 (∼2M) examples. To estimate counterfactual memorization, we train 400 models for each dataset, each on a random 25% subset of the training examples. In practice, text corpora are too large to be loaded entirely into memory, and data loading APIs only allow sequential visits to the examples, so we use a hash-based filtering mechanism to efficiently approximate random subset sampling.

Intuitively, simplicity indicates the easiness of an example; a simple example is one that is scored highly regardless of whether a model saw it during training. The histograms are plotted in log scale to better visualize the exponential decay in the tail for high memorization and simplicity levels.</p><p>From the 2D density plots, we observe that easy examples generally have low memorization. However, there is not a simple linear correlation. even garbage texts. As a result, in Wiki-40B:en, which contains higher quality texts, the lower bound of the histogram is higher than the other two datasets. Interestingly, the affects on the distribution of memorization is relatively minor: the shapes the memorization histogram are generally consistent across the three datasets, and the memorization value range is only slightly compressed for Wiki-40B:en.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Distributions Grouped by Web Domains</head><p>While Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> shows the overall distribution of memorization for each training datasets, for RealNews and C4, which have metadata on the source URL of each example, we can also analyze the distributions for individual web domains to see whether different sources display different memorization profiles. Web domains such as news portals, blogs, and forums differ both stylistically and in how much they reference or even copy from other websites. Additionally, some domains are represented much more frequently than others in the datasets we studied. This could lead to considerably different memorization profiles for examples coming from one domain as compared to another.</p><p>To investigate these issues, we visualize the 95th percentile memorization score in each domain against the number of examples in the domain for RealNews (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>) and C4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>). C4 contains many more domain names than RealNews since the latter is collected only from news websites. For both datasets, the domains with a large number of crawled documents show a smaller variance in the 95-percentile values, while "smaller" domains depict a wide range of variety in memorization profiles.</p><p>The memorization profiles of a few representative domains are visualized in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c and 3d</ref>. The domains we selected for visualization are: the largest domain (blue), the domain with highest 95 percentile memorization (orange), and two domains that have more than 1000 and 50 articles in RealNews and C4 respectively (green and red).</p><p>In RealNews (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>), reuters.com contains the largest number of documents but low memorization scores on average. The domain digita ibrary.un.org, the United Nations Digital Library, has high memorization scores potentially because it contains many multilingual documents. We have observed that less frequently occurring tokens, like those in foreign languages or ALL-CAPITAL words tend to cause high memorization. Similarly, flattened structured data (e.g. tabular texts) also deviates significantly from normal English texts and potentially leads to high memorization, as demonstrated by zap2it.com, a website for TV program listings. On the other hand, hotair.com is a news commentary website that frequently quotes other major news articles. This may lead to duplicate text in the dataset which we suspect contributes to its overall lower memorization distribution.</p><p>The observations are similar on C4: b ogspot.com contains a large number of documents in the training set with only moderate amounts of memorization; zh.wikipedia.org and buckinghamautos.com.au have high memorization due to foreign (Chinese) and structured (car sales listings) texts, respectively; www.unitedstateszipcodes.org has very low memorization scores because common templates are re-used to generate similar pages for individual zip codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">How Many Models Are Needed to Estimate Memorization?</head><p>To evaluate the impact of a single training example, one may wish to train two models that differ only in that single example. In practice, the stochasticity in a single run of common training algorithms (e.g. SGD) produces too low signal-to-noise ratios to be useful for such estimation. Moreover, leave-one-out estimation means a separate pair of model needs to be trained for each training example, which is computationally costly. As a result, we formulated our estimation in Section 2 by accumulating statistics from m models independently trained on random training subsets. In our experiments, we set m = 400. To understand how sensitive our results are to m, we analyze the rankings produced by distinct sets of models of size m. We vary m from 6 to 192, and partition our set of 400 models into up to 10 sets of m models (e.g. for m = 192, we construct 2 partitions, and for m = 6, we construct 10). We then compute the Spearman's R between these partitions to measure the agreement between the memorization rankings produced by each partition. If the rankings are very similar (have Spearman's R close to 1), then this number of models is reliably estimating the true ranking of memorization scores. We plot these Spearman's R values in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>. Even at 96 models, this correlation begins to plateau near 1, lending confidence that 400 models is sufficient for reliable estimation of memorization scores. See Appendix B for more analysis on the sensitivity to m. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Impact of Number of Training Epochs</head><p>As expected, the overall amount of memorization grows consistently with the number of epochs of training (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>). This makes sense since training for more epochs increases overfitting. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Duplicate Text and Memorization</head><p>By manually inspecting the sequences with low counterfactual memorization (e.g., those in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) we find that those sequences with near-duplicates in the training set tend to have low counterfactual memorization (as expected). In this section, we provide a quantitative study of the (anti-)correlation between redundancy and memorization. Following the method from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lee et al., 2021)</ref>, we first use MinHash <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Broder, 1997)</ref> to identify near-duplicate examples in RealNews train set. Out of the 2.01 million examples, ∼38,000 are identified as being a near-duplicate with at least one other example. Among these frequently-occurring examples, the Pearson correlation between an example's memorization score and the number of near-duplicates for that example is -0.39; in other words, memorization does quantitatively decrease when data is repeated more often. This matches our qualitative observations from earlier.</p><p>From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref> we can see that especially for the examples with a large number of near-duplicates, the memorization score is small. However, the overall anti-correlation is not strong. Especially for examples with no near-duplicates, memorization scores span the whole range of possible values, and depend on how easy it is to predict each example from the knowledge learned from the rest of the training corpus. This is to be contrasted with "generation-time memorization" (discussed in Section 2.2) that measures the textual overlap between model generated texts and the training documents. There, the number of occurrences strongly correlate with the measured memorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carlini et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lee et al., 2021)</ref>. This shows that counterfactual memorization goes beyond simple text matching, and can measure more nuanced qualities about training examples such as how easy or hard they are to be fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">From Memorization to Influence</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Counterfactual Influence</head><p>Counterfactual memorization identifies training examples that contain rare information not conveyed by other examples. A natural question to ask is whether a model would leak the information in a memorized example during inference. Previous paper studies membership inference attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Shokri et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sablayrolles et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Long et al., 2020)</ref> where an attacker tries to figure out if a particular example exists in the training set. In this paper, we consider standard model evaluation without adversarial attackers, and quantify "does seeing a particular training example strongly influence the prediction on a validation example?" Another way of asking this is if a single example in the training set has an large and over-representative impact on the prediction of a validation example. We answer these questions by measuring counterfactual influence with a formulation adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Feldman and Zhang (2020)</ref>: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Definition 2 (Counterfactual Influence).</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">infl(x ⇒ x ) S⊂D,x∈S [M (A(S), x )] − S⊂D,x ∈S [M (A(S), x )], (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where S is a subset of training examples sampled from D. The expectation is taken with respect to the random sampling of S, as well as the randomness in the training algorithm A. Here x can be an example from the validation set or test set, a generated example or a training example.</p><p>An empirical estimation of the influence can be estimated in a procedure similar to counterfactual memorization by uniformly sampling m subsets S 1 , . . . , S m from D, where |S i | = r|D|, and calculating</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">infl(x ⇒ x ) mean i:x∈S i [M (A(S i ), x )] − mean i:x ∈S i [M (A(S i ), x )].<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Counterfactual influence measures how much a training sample x's presence influences the prediction of a different example x . Note, mem(x) = infl(x ⇒ x), in other words, counterfactual memorization is self influence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Influence on Examples of the Validation Set</head><p>With the same models trained for estimating memorization, we can estimate the counterfactual influence on the validation set according to equation (4). For each example in the validation set, we can estimate the influence on it from each training example. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>  Therefore, if a validation set example x contains similar information, infl(x ⇒ x ) could be large. To study the relation between memorization and influence, in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, we plot mem(x) of each training example x against its maximum influence max x infl(x ⇒ x ) on x across the validation set. Consistent with our intuition, examples with small memorization scores have small max-influence scores. Larger influence scores on the validation set generally requires larger memorization scores of the training example itself. However, not all training examples with large memorization scores lead to large influence scores. In particular, the max-influences drop significantly for examples with memorization larger than 0.4. One potential reason is that many examples with very high memorization are simply low quality garbage texts, so memorization is required in order to learn them, but they do not encode anything interesting that could influence a validation example. On the other hand, even if a memorized example encodes some rare and useful information, the max-influence could still be low because the validation set does not contain a relevant document. This is especially true considering that the number of documents in the validation sets are considerably smaller than the training set for all datasets.</p><p>Table 2 shows train-validation example pairs from RealNews sampled at different influence value ranges. We found that the train-validation pairs with the highest influence are almost identical, except some superficial differences like the same URLs but one is with the http:// protocol and the other is https://, or different handling of quotation / em dash marks. As we move to intermediate influence ranges, we commonly found reports on the same events. Large paragraph of identical texts indicate that one might be citing the other or both citing from a third party. At low influence, two types of correlations are commonly observed: 1) templated texts with high similarity -the reason for a low influence is that there are many similar training examples that split the influence; 2) superficially related documents due to a shared prefix like ST. CLOUD -This week in our "Behind the Scenes" series on WJON, or a shared substring of some common knowledge like FSIS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The signal to noise ratio is too low for examples with influence scores below 0.02, and we did not find any noticeable relations in the document pairs sampled in that range.</p><p>Influence turns out to be an effective tool for analyzing and attributing the model predictions at test time: for predictions that rely on information obtained by (counterfactual) memorization, we can identify exactly which training example provided such information. Our observation of near-duplicated training-validation document pairs is consistent with recent studies that identifies data contamination in large Internet crawled text corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lee et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dodge et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Influence on Generated Texts</head><p>The influence estimation is not restricted to the validation set. We can also estimate influence on generated examples.

However, not all the memorized texts are equally interesting -as confirmed in a later study <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lee et al., 2021)</ref>, near-duplicated training examples are very common in standard text corpus, and those commonly occurring phrases contribute significantly to memorized texts. In order to distinguish "common" memorization of common phrases or public knowledge from "rare" memorization of private, rare information, various heuristics were adopted in previous investigations. Our paper proposed a principled perspective towards this problem. Our intuition comes from psychologies studies that categorize human (declarative) memory into episodic memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tulving, 1983)</ref> of specific contents of individual events, and semantic memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Squire, 1992)</ref> about general knowledge like grammars and factual information. We would like the models to obtain semantic memory but avoid episodic memory. The capture the latter, we proposed a notion of counterfactual memorization. The mathematical formulation of counterfactual memorization is borrowed from a notion of label memorization in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Feldman (2020)</ref> and adapted to the context of neural LMs in this paper.</p><p>The general idea of measuring model behavior on held-out training data is common in machine learning. In cross validation, held-out data is used to estimate the test performance for model selection; in learning theory, leave-one-out stability was shown to be deeply connected to generalization (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mukherjee et al., 2006)</ref>; in differential privacy, the worst case performance difference of models trained on two "neighboring" datasets (identical except a single example being held-out or replaced) quantifies the privacy guarantee of a learning algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dwork et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nasr et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jagielski et al., 2020)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Summary and Discussion</head><p>We studied memorization in neural language models. Inspired by a taxonomy of human memory in Psychology, we formulated a notion of counterfactual memorization as a tool that can systematically ignore "common" memorization such as common phrases ("How are you?") and captures memorization of rare information present in specific training examples. We conducted experiments on three commonly used text corpus in language modeling and found memorization in all of them. We further analyze the per-domain memorization profiles for Internet-crawled data, and found that different sources could have substantially different memorization profiles. Furthermore, we analyzed how memorized training examples could impact the model predictions at test time via counterfactual influence. We found that for examples from both the validation set and the model generated texts, the model predictions could be drastically different depending on the presence or absence of a particular training example with high memorization.</p><p>Limitations and Future Directions Both the neural language models and training sets used in this work are orders of magnitude smaller than modern standards such as GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)</ref> and T5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Raffel et al., 2020a)</ref>. Although our experiments effectively estimated and detected memorization, we suspect more interesting behaviors might emerge if larger, more capable models are analyzed. For example, currently when the information from a memorized training example is leaked in the prediction of a strongly influenced test example, it can usually be explained by a high text overlap between the training and test examples. For models with deeper understanding of languages, we suspect that strong influence could be observed even between documents that have no direct text overlap but that encode similar semantic information.</p><p>In order to test this, it will be necessary to scale our framework to larger models and datasets. Moreover, it will be necessary to construct datasets where such kind of semantically similar but textually different document pairs exist. One potential source to construct such datasets would be versioned Wikipedia articles, under the intuition that two versions of the same article with large time span or edit distance would contain semantically similar (but paraphrased) information.</p><p>Such a dataset of paraphrased text pairs would be more broadly useful to understand the ability of different models to disentangle text content and form-by measuring the influence of one piece of text on a paraphrased piece of text.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Variance of Memorization Scores</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10</ref>, we measure the Spearman's R between our total set of 400 models and an m model subset.</p><p>As expected, as m increases, so does Spearman's R-in particular, at 192 models, the Spearman's R is at least 99.2% for all datasets, and increasing m already appears to have diminishing returns.</p><p>Using the same partitioning into size m sets of models, we analyze the variance of memorization scores assigned to each sample. To do this, within each partition, we compute the memorization score assigned to each sample. We then compute the standard deviation of all partitions' memorization scores for each sample. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">11</ref>, we plot each sample's standard deviation -in all, this demonstrates the distribution of the variance of memorization scores. We find that the variance decreases substantially as m grows, and concentrates near 0 already with m = 192, for all datasets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Subsampling Procedure</head><p>In the estimation of memorization and influence, we trained 400 models each on an independent random subset of training examples. We use Tensorflow Datasets (TFDS)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> to load our training data. TFDS supports loading a continuous range of examples, but does not support subset loading from a list of indices of individual examples. The API has a fi ter function which allows us to provide a Tensorflow predicate to precisely control the subset loading. However, a naive implementation of checking whether the index of the current example is in a given list of subset indices is very slow and scales poorly with the subset size.</p><p>To mitigate the issue, we implemented a hash based subset sampling predicate that can be evaluated efficiently for each example, and (approximately) select a random subset of a specified size. Let N be the total number of training examples, n &lt; N be the expected subset size. The idea is to map the index i of each example to N /n hash buckets, and select all the examples that fall into one particular bucket.</p><p>To make sure each model gets an independent subset sampling, we need to use different hash functions for different models. In our implementation, we compose a known hash function for uint64 types with a simple pseudo number based on the index of the current model to achieve this. Note the subset size sampled is close to n but is not guaranteed to be exactly n. But this is not a problem in our settings. The specific implementation is shown below:</p><p>def hash_samp er(mod, seed, system): Get hash based subset samp er.</p><p>Args: mod: tota _n_egs // subset_size seed: different seed eads to different subset samp e system: np or tf . In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">12</ref>, we compare our hash-based subset sampler with numpy.random.choice(N, size=n, rep ace=Fa se).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Returns</head><p>The leftmost section of the figure shows that the sampling procedure always samples close to n points, with a small variance. The middle section plots a histogram of the empirical fraction of total models that each point appears in. Note that, because we use r = 0.25, this fraction should be 0.25 on average, although, because we only use 400 models, each value will not be identically 0.25. We find that our hash-based sampler produces probabilities which are highly consistent with those produced by numpy.random.choice.</p><p>We also measure the pairwise independence of the hash-based sampler, measuring the probability that two different training points x 1 , x 2 appear both IN or OUT of a model's training set. We expect this value to be 0.625 (=r 2 + (1 − r) 2 ). We plot this in the right portion of the figure, demonstrating that the independence of our hash-based sampler is very similar to numpy.random.choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D Alternative Memorization Metrics with Logit Scaling</head><p>We defined the counterfactual memorization in (1) with a generic performance measure M , and used the per-token accuracy as M throughout the paper. The finite value range could cause unnecessary compression for values near the interval boundary. As a result, the resolution of memorization estimation is lower for models with very high or very low performance. To mitigate this issue, we explore an alternative measure by taking the logit on the per-token accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carlini et al., 2021)</ref>. The logit function maps to (−∞, ∞) before aggregating across independently trained models. performance on IN / OUT models measured by the logit scaled per-token accuracy and the raw per-token accuracy. Comparing to the raw per-token accuracy, the scatter plots generated with the logit scaled measure are no longer artificially constrained to be a triangular shape. As a result, the memorization estimation, which is proportional to the distance to the diagonal line, has a higher resolution on the two ends (lower left and upper right) than the unscaled version.</p><p>Note there is no absolutely right or wrong measure. While the scaled version has better resolution on the two ends, the advantage of the unscaled version is that the value range [0, 1] makes it straightforward to interpret the numerical values of counterfactual memorization. Since the consistency between the two versions are high (Spearman's ρ correlation between the two versions are 0.947 / 0.903 / 0.944 on RealNews/ C4/ Wiki-40B:en), we use the unscaled version throughout the paper for easier interpretation.  A Texas honors student punished for saying that homosexuality was wrong has had his suspension rescinded after a meeting with the mother and her attorney. The 14-year-old, Dakota Ary, from Western Hills High School of the Fort Worth Independent School District was initially given a suspension of one day in-school and two days full. After hearing about the suspension the mother, Holly Pope, reached out to Matt Krause of the Liberty Counsel to be her son's legal representative. Matt Staver, founder and chairman of the Liberty Counsel, told The Christian Post that he believed Western Hills High made the correct decision in reversing their course of action. "The decision to rescind the suspension is the correct one. The suspension was wrong and improper," said Staver. "I applaud the student for standing up. We stood with him to resist an unjust suspension and we are pleased that suspension has been reversed." Dakota Ary was in a German language class at Western Hills when class conversation shifted to the issues of religion and homosexuality. The student reportedly said that "being a homosexual was wrong." Upon hearing his remark, the teacher proceeded to take administrative action. Ary himself is an honors student, noted for being a member of the high school's football team and a volunteer at his church. The rescinding of the suspension allows for him to play in an upcoming football game. In a publicly released statement, the Fort Worth Independent School District said that it does not comment on student matters. In keeping with this, Fort Worth ISD did not return comment to The Christian Post by press time. "As a matter of course, Fort Worth ISD does not comment on specific employee or student-related issues. Suffice it to say that we are following district policy in our review of the circumstances and any resolution will likewise be in accordance with district policy," said Fort Worth ISD. Stella &amp; Dot, the social commerce-based accessories company, will add to its offerings on April 8 with a full range of handbags. The nine-piece collection will retail from $22 for a cosmetics case to $138 for a weekender bag. Founder and chief executive officer Jessica Herrin called this the nearly 10-year-old company's "launch into a lifestyle brand," as well as a chance to double its market opportunity. "In the $30 billion accessories market in the U.S., bags and jewelry each account for approximately $10 billion," Herrin told WWD. "We see the same opportunity in bags as we did in jewelry -giving women on the go a simple way to be chic."Other styles include a $59 technology case that serves double duty as a clutch and wallet, a $39 jewelry roll, a classic $89 tote and a $128 convertible bag that has zippers up the side to let the wearer decide if she wants a sleeker or more expanded silhouette. A small handbag collection was released in 2011 -containing two cross-body and two convertible cross-body to clutch styles -but this is the first significant push for handbags geared for daytime use. With sales expected to surpass $200 million this year -business grew from $175 million to $200 million from 2011 to 2012 -Herrin projected the new category will take in about $25 million through the end of the year. In addition to the brand being carried exclusively online at stelladot.com, the brand is sold via 14,000 active stylists around the world. "We're really investing in this as a huge growth category. We just opened a dedicated in-house design studio for this in Sausalito [Calif.]," Stella &amp; Dot chief creative officer Blythe Harris said. She added that the bags are comprised of a combination of coated canvas, waffle poly and Saffiano leather and come in ikat, snakeskin and colorful multistripe prints.Herrin added: "Broadening our accessories line by launching the new and massive category of bags allows us to make that opportunity for stylists bigger than ever before. It's a ground-floor opportunity with a proven company." Police now have video from the home's surveillance system, "which shows Parker's actions prior to the shooting." A second suspect is believed to have run from the scene before police arrived. Parker and the homeowner did not know each other, police believe. Sources told News4 the homeowner has lived there for 17 years, and that about 10 people were inside the house at the time of the shooting, including children. A neighbor who asked News4 not to identify him said his car had been broken into multiple times.

"Six months ago we asked citizen scientists to jump online and help us analyse more than 80,000 photos taken from across the Illawarra region," Ms Upton said. "More than 300 volunteers answered the call and we can now confirm at least 20 individual quolls call this region home. "This is a great milestone for this citizen science project -in time to celebrate World Wildlife Day!" The Quollidor project is funded under the NSW Government's $100 million Saving our Species project and is providing a fascinating glimpse into the hidden world of this endangered carnivorous marsupial. The 29 motion sensor cameras in the region collect 20,000 to 30,000 images every 8 weeks that the enthusiastic citizen scientists have sorted through. "We have images of quolls posing for selfies, exploring the camera and jumping on and around the monitoring station," Ms Upton said. Quolls have huge home ranges and move across the landscape making it difficult to otherwise monitor their population and behavioural patterns. "It's great to see people being able to use technology to make a real contribution to the conservation of NSW's unique animals," Ms Upton said. The spotted-tailed quoll is the only remaining quoll species in the state. The project is ongoing and will help the NSW Government increase the resilience and size of the local quoll population. .

First, the carbonyl of the acid attacks the carbodiimide of EDC, and there is a subsequent proton transfer. The primary amine then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the acid which forms a tetrahedral intermediate before collapsing and discharging the urea byproduct. The desired amide is obtained. The pilot performed an autorotation landing in a forest following the failure of both engines. The helicopter suffered extensive damage and was written off as a total loss, but despite the severity of the crash there were no fatalities. Fourteen of the 15 people on board were injured, including Leszek Miller, who had two of his thoracic vertebrae broken. _START_SECTION_ Aircraft and pilot _START_PARAGRAPH_ The helicopter was 26 years old at the time of the crash, and was close to the end of its service. It belonged to the 36th Special Aviation Regiment responsible for transporting Polish government officials. The pilot of the helicopter was major Marek Miłosz, later promoted to lieutenant colonel. _START_SECTION_ Cause _START_PARAGRAPH_ The cause of the engine failure was determined to be icing. _START_SECTION_ Trial _START_PARAGRAPH_ On 10 March 2004, Miłosz was criminally charged with violating flight safety rules and causing the crash. Specifically, the pilot was blamed for not manually turning on the deicing equipment during the flight. The pilot argued that the meteorologic information available to him at the time did not indicate that icing was likely, and hence he was not required to turn on the deicing equipment. He was consulting a thermometer during the flight, but it suffered from a systematic measurement error and hence was unable to warn of icing. In addition, during the flight an unusual thermal inversion occurred; the temperature rose with altitude, which the pilot could not have predicted._NEWLINE_In March 2010, the 6-year trial ended with a verdict of not guilty. The judge in the case noted the pilot expertly carried out the difficult autorotation landing and that the passengers survived because of his superb piloting skills. _START_ARTICLE_ RTV silicone _START_PARAGRAPH_ RTV Silicone (Room-Temperature-Vulcanizing silicone) is a type of silicone rubber made from a twocomponent system (base plus curative; A+B) available in a hardness range of very soft to medium--usually from 15 to 40 Shore A. RTV silicones can be cured with a catalyst consisting of either platinum or a tin compound such as dibutyltin dilaurate. Applications include low-temperature over-molding, making molds for reproducing, and lens applications for some optically clear grades. _START_SECTION_ Applications _START_PARAGRAPH_ To produce the material, the silicone rubber is mixed with the curing agent or vulcanizing agent. Usually, the mixing ratio is a few percent. In order for the RTV silicone to reproduce the surface texture, attention is paid to the cleanliness of the original. Vacuum de-airing removes entrained air bubbles from the mixed silicone and catalyst to ensure optimal tensile strength, which affects reproduction times. In casting and mold-making, RTV silicone rubber reproduces fine details and is suitable for a variety of industrial and art-related applications including prototypes, furniture, sculpture, and architectural elements.</p><p>RTV silicone rubber can be used to cast materials including wax, gypsum, low melt alloys/metals and urethane, epoxy or polyester resins (without using a release agent). A more recent innovation is the ability to 3D print RTV silicones. RTV silicones' industrial applications include aviation, aerospace, consumer electronics, and microelectronics. Some aviation and aerospace product applications are cockpit instruments, engine electronics potting, and engine gasketing. RTV silicones are used for their ability to withstand mechanical and thermal stress. _START_SECTION_ Advantages and disadvantages _START_PARAGRAPH_ RTV silicone rubber has excellent release properties compared to mold rubbers, which is especially an advantage when doing production casting of resins (polyurethane, polyester, and epoxy). No release agent is required, obviating post-production cleanup. Silicones also exhibit good chemical resistance and high-temperature resistance (205 °C, 400 °F and higher). For this reason, silicone molds are suitable for casting low-melt metals and alloys (e.g. zinc, tin, pewter, and Wood's metal). _NEWLINE_RTV silicone rubbers are, however, generally expensive--especially platinum-cure. They are also sensitive to substances (sulfur-containing modelling clay such as Plastilina, for example) that may prevent the silicone from curing (referred to as cure inhibition). Silicones are usually very thick (high viscosity), and must be vacuum degassed prior to pouring, to minimize bubble entrapment. If making a brush-on rubber mold, the curing time factor between coats is long (longer than urethanes or polysulfides, shorter than latex). Silicone components (A+B) must be mixed accurately by weight (scale required) or they do not work.  By Ari Rabinovitch TZEELIM VALLEY, Israel (Reuters) -The disposable paper face masks offer little protection from the clouds of dust that fill the cliffside cave where Israeli archaeologists are wrapping up the largest excavation in the Judean desert of the past half-century. Clipped into safety harnesses, volunteers stand at the cave opening, 250 meters (820 feet) above a dry river bed that leads to the lowest spot on earth, the Dead Sea. They sift through an endless supply of dirt-filled buckets, and the dust they throw in the air reaches the far corners of the cave where a dozen workers crawling on hands and knees can't help but cough. The three-week excavation was the first part of a national campaign to recover as many artefacts as possible, particularly scrolls, left behind by Jewish rebels who hid in the desert some 2,000 years ago, before they are snatched up by antiquity robbers. "These looters that operate in the area are experts at finding scrolls. We go after them, look for what they are looking for and try to catch them," said Guy Fitoussi, head of the Israel Antiquities Authority robbery prevention unit in southern Israel. "This is the game. Like cat and mouse." The Dead Sea Scrolls, a collection of ancient texts written on papyrus and parchment, have already been rescued by scholars. They are among the earliest texts written in the Hebrew language and are on display in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem as a national treasure. Now Israel wants to uncover whatever may remain in the desert hideouts before it is destroyed or ends up on the black market.

Fitoussi, a pistol-packing archaeologist with authority to arrest looters, and his team catch about 100 of them each year. Most are fined; some are sent to jail. In 2014, they arrested six people who were plundering this particular cavern, known as the Cave of Skulls, where seven skulls had been found from Jews of the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Rome in the 2nd century. That raid, Fitoussi said, helped spur the multi-year government-backed excavation program and focused their initial efforts at this site, about a two-hour drive southeast from Jerusalem. To access the cave, diggers don climbing gear and descend 20 minutes from their campsite along a steep path that hugs the rocky cliff. Inside, the grotto expands 160 square meters (1,720 square feet), including a number of cramped tunnels that extend deep into the mountain. The limestone walls of the dry desert cave are perfect for preservation, said Uri Davidovich, an archaeologist from Tel Aviv University who was one of the dig's directors. One 19-year-old volunteer, working flat on her belly in a dark crawl space, dirt mixed with sweat covering her face and digging with her fingers, unearthed a thin, 25 centimeter (10 inch)-long rope that most likely was used by the Bar Kokhba rebels. A rope this length was a rare discovery, Davidovich said. They haven't found any scrolls yet, he said, but the artefacts found in this cave, and countless others nearby, will provide historians rare insight into how people lived 2,000 to 8,000 years ago.

"Benedict XVI: The Final Conversations," is due out in September, the latest book-length interview that Benedict has conducted with German journalist Peter Seewald.

It's only the first game of the preseason, but a new era has clearly begun. A group of mostly newcomers in Ducks uniforms beat Phoenix 3-2 in a shootout on Wednesday at Honda Center. A, although a familiar face made the biggest impact, however, as Bobby Ryan scored two goals in regulation and another in the shootout. Ryan also scored two goals in the Ducks' preseason opener last year, when he was trying to make the team's opening-day roster as a rookie. His bid failed and Ryan was forced to start the season in the American Hockey League, mostly due to salary-cap constraints. The circumstances could not be much different this yearore different now. Ryan finished thelast season as a Calder Trophy candidate, and began this season wearing a temporary alternate captain's "A" on his jersey along with Joffrey Lupul and Sheldon Brookbank. Nick Boynton, a 30-year-old defenseman signed in the offseason, was the eldest player in uniform. Of the 20 players chosen to play, only goaltender Jonas Hiller and center Ryan Carter spent all of last season with the Ducks. Hiller started in goal and looked sharp, stopping 18 of the 19 shots he faced. Timo Pielmeier, acquired in the trade that sent Kent Huskins and Travis Moen to San Jose, came in halfway through the third period and stopped 27 of 2 of 23 shots before the game went into overtime8. A phantom interference penalty sent Ducks defenseman Steve Eminger to the box, and set up a power-play goal by the Coyotes' Lauri Korpikowski with 20.2 left in the period. Korpikowski deflected a long-range shot by Keith Yandle, and Hiller did well just to get his glove on itopening period. Ryan got the goal back early in the second period, poking in a rebound of a Dan Sexton shot past former Kings goalie Jason LaBarbera at the 3:09 mark.

The green example is randomly chosen from the validation set, and represents the behavior for most validation examples: it receive close-to-zero influence from all the (individual) training examples. The blue and orange examples are sampled according to high and intermediate maximum influence. Each of them has one (or a few) strong influencer from the training set, as indicated by the bars to the right of the histogram. They also only receive tiny influence from all the rest of the training examples, though the variance of influence is larger than the green example. Intuitively, most training examples will have small influence on validation set examples, because the statistical patterns learned by the models are generally shared across many training examples, resulting in insignificant influence from each individual training example. However, a training example, x, with high counterfactual memorization contains rare information that are not shared with other examples.</figDesc></figure>

News4's Darcy Spencer reports. A homeowner in Maryland shot and killed a man who he caught breaking into his vehicle hours after Christmas Day, police say. Sources tell News4 the shooting, which occurred in an area repeatedly hit by car break-ins, appears to be justified. Deontae Parker, of no fixed address, died after he was shot the day early Tuesday outside a home in Chillum, Maryland, Prince George's County police said. He was 32. Police said Tuesday that they were investigating what happened. "We're still working through all the details to determine what led up to the shooting," Cpl. Tyler Hunt said. A resident of a home on the 6200 block of Sligo Parkway called 911 about 2:15 a.m. Tuesday to report a shooting.Officers arrived and found a man with a gunshot wound to the upper body. He was pronounced dead. According to the preliminary investigation, detectives believe the homeowner --who police have not identified --shot Parker from inside his home after Parker "had broken into the homeowner's vehicle," police said in an update Wednesday morning. News4 footage shows a bullet hole in a window.</figDesc></figure>

TAP is a part of the Southern Gas Corridor project, aimed at diversifying the European energy supply sources and routes. The 930-kilometer long TAP project envisages transportation of gas from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz Stage 2 to the EU countries. The pipeline will connect to the Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) on the Turkish-Greek border, run through Greece, Albania and the Adriatic Sea, before coming ashore in Italy's south. TAP's shareholding is comprised of BP (20 percent), SOCAR (20 percent), Snam S.p.A.

"Unfortunately, we have seen similar situations. The homosexual agenda is aggressive and intolerant to people who do not agree.

"I want to update you that they arrested Nabeel Rajab at 1.30 am and the riot police came to my home and I'm not in my home right now," Said Yousif of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights said in an email sent overnight. Rajab had spoken to media about the crackdown and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights put out statements this week accusing Bahraini forces and their Saudi and Emirati</figDesc><table /><note>allies of "massacres" including some using Apache helicopters. Bahraini state television has said that Bahrain does not own Apache helicopters. Four protesters and three police have been confirmed killed in Wednesday's crackdown. Neither Rajab nor Yousif could be reached by phone early on Sunday, but some Twitter feeds suggested Rajab had already been released after questioning by police. Rajab's arrest would bring to 10 the number of people believed to have been arrested since the crackdown began on Wednesday. Among the others are opposition leaders who had called for the overthrow of the monarchy and doctors who had complained of excessive use of force against protesters.

(ANF) saw new options become available today, for the April 4th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, ourYieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ANF options chain for the new April 4th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest. The put contract at the $34.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.97. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $34.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $32.03 (before broker commissions).To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ANF, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $34.60/share today. Because the $34.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.79% return on the cash commitment, or 49.23% annualized -at Stock Options Channel we call this the START SLIDESHOW : Top YieldBoost Puts of the S&amp;P 500 » Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., and highlighting in green where the $34.00 strike is located relative to that history: Here are the numbers you need to know.

It features single or cooperative play with as many as 8 humans against a pair of powerful, intelligent AIs. These AIs are driven by an AI Progress stat that players contribute to through aggressive actions such as taking control of planets and destroying key units, forcing tough decisions regarding which targets are worth capturing or destroying. Human fleets are usually several thousand ships in size or larger, with games often featuring 30,000 units at any given time across galaxies of anywhere from 10 to 120 planets. Some games have reached as many as 90,000 units! Despite this, players retain powerful control over their fleets in a macro-sense, ignoring painful micromanagement present in other games in favor of actual tactics like flanking. Meanwhile, ships themselves attempt to target enemies as intelligently as possible so the player can focus on the tasks that really matter.

Hard to believe I haven't had everything on offer there yet, but that's Belgian pubs for you: even a run-of-the-mill one will have 30 or so types. Le Châtelain probably has closer to 60. Floreffe's dark beers, Floreffe Dubbel and Floreffe Prima Melior, are included in my list of top ten Belgian beers, so I was expecting great things with Floreffe Blond. I wasn't disappointed. Floreffe Blond is lighter than normal strong blond ales. It's lemony, summery. Fiona says it's smooth and has a bubble gum taste --"that powdery, old-style bubble gum" --but I'm sticking with citrus. It has very little bitterness, but it's not sweet. At 6.3% alcohol, it's not too brain-bending either. Which is just as well, because the wood treatment is doing my head in plenty enough.</figDesc><table><row><cell>1795710</cell><cell>0.2217 https://www.snohomishcountywa.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1619</cell></row></table><note>EVERETT, Wash., April 15 -Snohomish County's Department of Planning and Development Services (PDS) today announced an on-line survey to gather public input for the Southwest Urban Growth Area Boundary Planning Study. Obtaining feedback from those who live, work, and play in Snohomish County about their quality of life and improvements they would like to see is at the heart of everything the county does. The Southwest Urban Growth Area (SWUGA) Boundary Planning Study (BPS) is no different. It is a high-level study of existing conditions and opportunities and constraints which can inform future planning choices. As part of the BPS, an online survey is available until April 26 for community members in the SWUGA BPS area, and outside the area, to give their feedback. The study area includes lands currently designated and zoned rural uses extending eastward from the SWUGA to Broadway Ave, north to Cathcart and south to the county line. It includes the Maltby Urban Growth Area (UGA) for context, as a key center. No changes to land use or boundaries are proposed for Maltby UGA or any other portion of the Boundary Planning Area as part of this study. The area has been chosen for study given it is adjacent to a fast-growing portion of the SWUGA. The study provides an opportunity to develop comprehensive information on environmental, socio-economic, infrastructure cost, and policy implications to inform future planning efforts. Using technical information and public outreach results, the study can help identify what currently works well and what doesn't in the SWUGA BPS area (e.g. roads within and beyond the study area)</note></figure>

It's only the first game of the preseason, but a new era has clearly begun. A group of mostly newcomers in Ducks uniforms beat Phoenix 3-2 in a shootout on Wednesday at Honda Center. A familiar face made the biggest impact, however, as Bobby Ryan scored two goals. Ryan also scored two goals in the Ducks' preseason opener last year, when he was trying to make the team's opening-day roster as a rookie. His bid failed and Ryan was forced to start the season in the American Hockey League, mostly due to salary-cap constraints. The circumstances could not be much different this year. Ryan finished the season as a Calder Trophy candidate, and began this season wearing a temporary alternate captain's "A" on his jersey along with Joffrey Lupul and Sheldon Brookbank. Nick Boynton, a 30-year-old defenseman signed in the offseason, was the eldest player in uniform. Of the 20 players chosen to play, only goaltender Jonas Hiller and center Ryan Carter spent all of last season with the Ducks. Hiller started in goal and looked sharp, stopping 18 of the 19 shots he faced. Timo Pielmeier, acquired in the trade that sent Kent Huskins and Travis Moen to San Jose, came in halfway through the third period and stopped 22 of 23 shots before the game went into overtime. A phantom interference penalty sent Ducks defenseman Steve Eminger to the box, and set up a power-play goal by the Coyotes' Lauri Korpikowski with 20.2 left in the period. Korpikowski deflected a long-range shot by Keith Yandle, and Hiller did well just to get his glove on it. Ryan got the goal back early in the second period, poking in a rebound of a Dan Sexton shot past former Kings goalie Jason LaBarbera. With 1:08 elapsed in the third period, Ryan made it 2-1 on a breakaway shot that caromed in off a Phoenix stick. Phoenix tied the game at 2 at 12:30 of the third period, when Sheldon Brookbank made a costly turnover in front of his own net. Chad Kolarik batted down Brookbank's pass just a few feet in front of Pielmeier and tucked the puck in behind the goaltender.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Index</cell><cell cols="2">Estim.

Product numbers "EST. P-7345" inside the USDA mark of inspection are subject to recall. They were shipped to nationwide retail and institutional locations. RELATED: View the full recall FSIS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its public health partners are investigating a multistate outbreak of salmonella schwarzengurn involving five case-patients from two states. According to the USDA, Wisconsin collected three intact Butterball brand ground turkey samples from a residence where four of the case-patients live. Signs of salmonellosis, also known as salmonella foodborne illnesses, appear within one to three days after consumption of contaminated products. They include diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. The illness lasts four to seven days. According to the USDA, most people recover without treatment, however, they suggest that if diarrhea is severe the person might need to be contaminated. They also suggest those with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to illness. Consumers with food safety questions can "Ask Karen," the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov. The tollfree USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-674-6854 is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. MDT Monday through Friday.

One issue with these extraction attacks is that they often identify primarily "common" and frequently occurring strings in the training set. For example, as shown in the analysis of<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lee et al. (2021)</ref>, near-duplicate training examples are very common in standard text corpora, and account for a large majority of the memorized content. To filter out such commonly occurring strings from all memorized texts, previous work applied various heuristic rules to distinguish frequently-occurring sequences from memorization of "rare" texts.</note>

Monsoon rainfall is expected to be 96 percent of the long-term average, M. Rajeevan, secretary at the Ministry of Earth Sciences, told a news conference. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 centimeters for the entire four-month season beginning June. "Overall, the country is expected to have well distributed rainfall scenario during the 2019 monsoon season, which will be beneficial to farmers in the country during the ensuing Kharif (summer-planting) season," the IMD said in its forecast. El Nino triggered back-to-back droughts in 2014 and 2015, for only the fourth time in over a century, driving some Indian farmers to penury and suicide. ECONOMIC GROWTH Good rains will spur the planting of crops such as rice, corn, cane, cotton and soybeans. Stronger agricultural production would help support India's economy. It is still the world's fastest-growing major economy, but annual growth slowed to 6.6 percent in the December quarter, from 7.0 percent in the previous period and the slowest in five quarters. The monsoon usually covers the half of the country in the first 15 days. The rains reach central India's soybean areas by the third week of June and western cotton-growing areas by the first week of July. India's weather office will update its forecast in the first week of June. However, on average, the IMD has forecast accurately only once every five years over the past two decades, even after taking into account an error band of plus or minus 5 percentage points.</p><p>train 326212 men 0.1555 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-monsoon/india-set-to-receive-average-monsoon-rains-in-boost-for-poll-bound-modi-idUSKBN1HN1AQ</p><p>NEW DELHI: (Reuters) -India is likely to see areceiverage monsoon rains this year average monsoon rains in 2018, the state-run weather office said on Mondayweather office said, which should support agricultural productionraising the possibility of higher farm and economic growth in Asia's third-biggest economy, where half of the farmland lacks irrigation. Monsoon rainfall iss, the lifeblood of the country's $2 trillion economy, are expected to be 96 percent of the7 percent of a long-term average, MK.J. Rajeevanmesh, secretary at the Ministry of Earth Sciences, told a news conference. Thedirector general of the state-run India Meteorological Department (IMD) defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 centimeters for the entire four-month season beginning Juntold a news conference. "We see very less probability of a deficit monsoon," Ramesh said on Monday. Overallther than lifting farm and wider economic growth, the country is expected to have well distributed rainfall scenario during thea spell of good rains will keep a lid on inflation, potentially tempting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring forward general elections due in May 2019 monsoon season. India's weather office defines average, which will be beneficial to farmers in the country during the ensuing Kharif (summeror normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-planting) seasonyear average of 89 cms for the entire four-month season beginning June. "The moderate La Nina conditions developed in the equatorial Pacific during last year started weakening in the early part of this year and currently have turned to weak La Nina conditions," the IMD said in its forecasa statement. SkymetLa Nina is a weather pattern that brings equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures, the country's only prirainfall patterns and winds closer to avate weather forecasting agency, earlier this month forecast rainfall could be below normal this yearerage. The latest forecasts from global models indicate conditions over the Pacific will turn neutral before the beginning of monsoon season, the IMonsoon rainsD said. Good rains will spur the planting of crops such as rice, the lifeblood forcorn, cotton and soybeans, accelerating economic growth that rose 7.2 percent in the December quarter, its fastest in five quarters, compared with China's 6.8 percent in that quarter. Growth in the December quarter restored India's farmstatus as the world's fastest growing major economy. RURAL INCOME Average monsoon rains, with good distribution in July and August would support rural demand, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&amp;T Finance Holdings, a Mumbai-dependent $2based non-banking finance company.6 trillion economy Good rains boost rural incomes, arrive on the southern tip of Kerala state around June 1 and retreat from the desert state of Rajasthan by Septemberlifting the demand for an array of consumer goods ranging from lipsticks to refrigerators. After a wet spelln average monsoon would keep food inflation lower, sowing of summer-sown crops gets off to a strong startNitsure said. On Monday, boosting crop yields and output which in turn raises rural incomes and usually lifts consumer spending ingovernment data showed India's wholesale food prices fell 0.07 percent in March 2018 from a year earlier. If plentiful monsoon rains lift agricultural production this yearndia's weather office will update its forecast in June. On an average, that could e IMD has forecast accurately only once in every five years over the past two decades, even after takeep food prices under controling into account an error band of plus or minus 5 percentage points. Subdued Rains usually lash Kerala state on the south coast around June 1, and coverall inflation could also add to pressure on the whole country by mid-July. Timely rains trigger planting of crops such as rice, soybeans and cotton. The monsoon usually covers the half of the country in the first 15 days. The rains reach central India's central bansoybean areas by the third week to cut interest ratesof June and western cotton-growing areas by the first week of July. Good rains would help boost soybean output which in turn could cut expensive vegetable oil imports by India, the world's biggest importer of edible oils, which is the third-biggest import item after crude oil and gold. Currently India is struggling with huge amounts of sugar and good rains could further bump up the supply of the sweetener. "IMD's prelim forecastA good monsoon will help bring down edible oil imports, showing nearnormal and well distributed rainfall, will bode well for near-term food inflationbut it could also create a problem of plenty in pulses and sugar," said a Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Edelweiss Securities, FX and Rates. The next policy review by India's central bank is scheduled for June 6, after the country's election. Millions of Indians are casting their votes in a mammoth general election, spread over seven weeks. On the downside, higher production could mean farmers continue to get hit by low crop prices, a major cause for concern in rural India, where most Indians live, in the past two yearsumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm. After falling for five straight months, retail food prices inrage monsoon rainfall will help India rose 0.30 percent in March from a year earlietain its position as the world's top rice exporter. Last month, a senior IMD official told Reuters that this year's monsoon was likely to be robust and healthy provided there wasn't a surprise El Nino phenomenon. "El Nino is weakening and we expect that El Nino will get weakened further. There is no reason to be worried about El Nino," Rajeevan said. A strong El Nino, marked by a warming of the sea surface on the Pacific Ocean, can cause severe drought in Australia, Southeast Asia and India, while drenching other parts of the world such as the US Midwest and Brazil in rains. The emergence of a strong El Nino triggered back-to-back droughts in 2014 and 2015, for only the fourth time in over a century, driving some Indian farmers to penury and suicide.
