<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Traditionally, researchers have focused on network level intrusion detection and program level intrusion detection to improve computer security. However, neither approach is foolproof. Typically, a successful attacker manifests in the form of the attacker becoming a user on the host either with elevated or normal user privileges. The reason for this situation is that current research and technology development have focused on external, not internal. At this point, user-level intrusion detection attempts to deter and curtail an attacker even after the system has been compromised. This paper proposed a novel method for anomaly detection of user behavior. Considering the complexity and fluctuation of user behavior, our method builds a finite automaton to profile the user's normal behavior with closeness of commands within patterns and timing sequence and frequency information between patterns. This allows discrete data used for training to have a holistic structure that allows for a more accurate expression of the normal behavior of the user. In the detection stage, our method builds a threat evaluation system using fuzzy logic. Experimental results on data sets of Purdue University, SEA and self-collected data show that an accurate, effective and efficient detection can be achieved using the proposed approach.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Trusted user behavior is the embodiment of computer system trustworthiness. Although insider attacks may not occur as frequently as external attacks, they have a higher rate of success, can go undetected and pose a much greater risk than external attacks.</p><p>Easy collection of shell commands is often used as a research object for user behavior when users interact directly with the system. After a series of processing, the original command data will form a sequence of commands in chronological order. This sequence of commands and short sequences intercepted at a certain step size are often used to characterize user behavior.</p><p>For specific tasks, the sequence of commands of normal users always presents a kind of regularity and similarity. These normal sequences can be used to describe the user's normal behavior profiles. In the evaluation of a specific task, a user whose command sequence is similar to the user profiles within a certain range, the user is considered to be a normal user. Otherwise, if the similarity exceeds a certain range, the user's behavior will be abnormal.</p><p>User behavior is complex and variable depending on the content, interest, time, and so on. It is difficult to represent the behavior by precise threshold. On the other hand, the behavior of computer users also has relative stability and regularity. User behavior is known to be a causal process, where a user executes one or more commands to accomplish a particular task. In general, the frequency and distribution of commands usage in normal behavior are relatively fixed and follow certain statistical laws. If the user's work task does not change, the usage of the command will stabilize after a period of time, even if the user tries some new usage of command or the user is an unskilled user. The masquerader wants to complete the attack task in the shortest possible time. It is difficult to imitate a genuine user by camouflage of command usage. In other words, it is impossible for intruders to mimic normal user who are harmless to the computer system without using special command to implement the attack as soon as possible.</p><p>Currently, known user-level intrusion detection algorithms rely on different theoretical methods and different user characteristics to profile user behavior, perform user classification, predict future behavior.</p><p>Lane et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> focused on normal behavior at user behavior level using command data. Schonlau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> selected several algorithms based on statistics to detect intruder. Ye et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> present a Markov-chain model to represent a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal operating condition of a computer and network system. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of genuine user. On the contrary, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from attacks. There are dependencies between commands. And the association of commands can be used to profile the user behavior based on hidden markov models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. HMM describes stochastic process and represents some nonstationary sequence. The methods of HMM have high computation cost. Of course they are effective.</p><p>An entropy-based anomaly detection method was proposed to detect modern botnet-like malware based on anomalous patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Kanda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> gives ADMRE to overcome the weakness of signature-based detection. It is an efficient anomaly detection method using entropybased PCA with three-step shetches. ENTVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is introduced to help traffic metrics and anomaly detection. In order to solve the problem of parameter sensitivity, these methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> combine entropy theory with other theories.</p><p>According to Ikram Sumaiya Thaseen and Cherukuri Aswani Kumar <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a intrusion detection model using Chisquare feature selection and multi-class SVM is proposed to classify user behavior. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> investigated a novel method based on PCA and SVM by optimization of kernel parameters for reducing the training and testing time. An empirical study is performed to investigate the effectiveness of SVM in detecting abnormal user <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Similar studies are available in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. As a machine learning method based on statistical learning theory, SVM is susceptible to noise interference due to statistical methods, human error and other factors. For constructing the optimal classification hyperplane, the noises, outliers and SVs near the boundary play the same role. In order to be accurate, each vector should be given different coefficients.</p><p>In recent years, with the breakthrough of hardware technology bottleneck, neural network has been widely used in computer vision and natural language processing and achieved remarkable results <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.

Sheraz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> applied convolutional neural network to intrusion detection in real environment. The cost of accelerating training is that multiple GPUs must be deployed on a physical host. The challenge of approaches based on neural network is pricey and space consuming due to the increasing amount of data.</p><p>It is worth noting that fuzzy theory has been used in user behavior detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. Fuzzy logic is good at expressing qualitative knowledge and experience with unclear boundaries. It uses the concept of membership function to distinguish fuzzy sets and deal with fuzzy relations, simulates the implementation of uncertainty concept judgment and regular reasoning in the human brain, and solves all kinds of uncertainty problems caused by the logical breaking.</p><p>Thus far, there are few ways to handle uncertainty and fluctuation. But uncertainty and fluctuation are unavoidable phenomena during the decision-making process which leads to the classifier a difficult job to make a system reliable.</p><p>Motivated by tolerance of uncertainty and fluctuation, the overall goal of this paper is focused on issuing uncertainty and fluctuation of user behavior. The main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows:</p><p>User behavior is complex and variable. For solving the problem of behavior fluctuation, a method of user behavior evaluation based on fuzzy logic is proposed. During the training phase, the timing and frequency information between the patterns and the closeness information between commands within the patterns are introduced. The finite automaton is used to characterize the normal behavior profile of the user. In this way, the discrete information has the global and structural features, which makes the self of user behavior more accurate in profiling. During the detection phase, a user behavior fuzzy reasoning system is constructed. The experiment results show that the proposed model has good detection ability and can tolerate the user fluctuation.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes some preliminaries including basic definitions and concepts of user behavior analysis and profile. In Sect. 3, the reasoning method based on fuzzy logic is proposed, while Sect. 4 presents experimental results, in order to demonstrate the performance of our method. Finally, the concluding remarks are giving in Sect. 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preliminaries</head><p>In this section, we recapitulate some important definitions and concepts related to the background of this study.</p><p>The shell command sequence can not fully reflect the genuine user behavior when the data are insufficient. This leads to false positive. In general, a pattern similar to a normal pattern is considered to be a legal pattern. The likelihood that abnormal patterns belong to the normal pattern database increases exponential, as the number of such pattern increases.</p><p>In order to improve the precision and adaptability of user profiling, it is the necessary to mine the pattern information of state transition, frequency, relativity between various patterns derived from shell commands. In addition, it is critical to measure the relationship between each command in a pattern.</p><p>This paper demonstrates how to representation user behavior based on finite state automata.</p><p>A finite automaton is represented as a directed graph with the nodes representing the states and the links representing the transitions.</p><p>Definition 1 A finite state automaton consists of 5-tuple M=(S, P ? , ?, q, F), where S is a finite set of states; P ? is a finite input alphabet; ? is the set of transitions between the states ?: S P ? S; q is the initial state; and F is the set of final states.</p><p>Compared with the finite state machine, the basic finite state machine only has initial state and accepted state. The primary task of constructing finite state automaton is to determine the state and transition edge of automaton. The states of a finite automaton were generated by sliding window. The last command in the precursor state is considered to be a transition edge to the successor state.</p><p>Definition 2 A basic finite state automaton consists of 3tuple M=(S, P ? , ?), where S is a finite set of states; P ? is a finite input; ? is the set of transitions between the states ?: S P ? S.</p><p>When an unusual state appears, it may be the abnormal behavior. The basic finite state automaton cannot reflect the frequency information of command block. It is beneficial to extend the basic finite state automaton to the flexible state automaton.</p><p>Definition 3 A Flexible finite state automaton consists of 4-tuple M=(S, P ? , ?, N), where S is a finite set of states; P ? is a finite input set; ? is the set of transitions between the states ?: S P ? S, N is the number of states transferred out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A Fuzzy Approach to User-level Intrusion Detection</head><p>It is possible to learn a finite state automaton representation of user behavior, without the state explosion. It is a small representation used to monitor user behavior, has little overhead, and is beneficial to real-time monitoring. In the detection stage, a fuzzy risk analysis approach is proposed to detect deviation between the normal user profiles represented by finite automata and real-time behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Representation of User Behavior</head><p>User intrusion detection deals with user command data, which is closely tied to user behavior.</p><p>(1) When generating user behavior profiles, it is necessary to collect the initial data sets, sanitize and obtain the relevant information. for example, it takes months or times years to obtain representative data sets for each user. In order to sanitize data, the command names and metadata are retained, the directories, file names are replaced by uniform identifiers. In this way, insert identifiers at the beginning and end of the session and connect multiple sessions in sequence. (2) Let R=(c 1 ,c 2 , ?,c k ?, k, ?,w i , l i be the command sequence, length of R, command set, sliding window size, sliding length, respectively. Then, m = P j j is the number of different commands in ?, n=(k-w i )/l i +1 is the number of window, C=(seq 1 ,seq 2 , ?,seq n ) is the short command sequence that is obtained after setting the values of c k and l i . R can also be represented by the n ? m matrix V, each column vector indicates the frequency that a command appears in different windows, and each row vector indicates the frequency that different commands appear in a window.</p><p>(3) Let s i , i=1,2, ?,m is the command corresponding to column i. Then, the closeness between command c i and c j can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">?1?</formula><p>where binary matrix B=[b ij ] or B 0 ? ?b 0 ij generated by matrix V. B is used to indicate whether command s j appears in the window w i . The same command appears multiple times in a window that can be seen as an alternation between the command and its twin command. The average command closeness in a window is called the degree of aggregation of the window. The aggregation value of legitimate user is higher than illegal user. (4) If T contains more than one R. Let N ?seq i j ? is the number of times seq i j that appears in T. For a given e i , seq i j is usual if N ?seq i j ? ! e i , otherwise it is unusual. (5) Let ?=(P, N, A, B) is the pattern set record defined in symbol set ? and training set T, i = (p i j , n i j , A i j , B i j ) is the pattern set record of R i , where n i j is the times of p i j appeared in i , pattern set A i j contains patterns which appears after pattern p i j , B i j contains patterns which appears before pattern p i j , p i j 2 P, n i j 2 N , A i j A or ?, B i j Bor?. There is a one-to-one relationship between a pattern in pattern set of the training set T and the state of the finite state automaton. To facilitate simplification, we use capital letters to represent command symbols. Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T={R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 }, where, R 1 = (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I), R 2 = (B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I), R 3 = (B, C, D, E, F, H, I), R 4 = (B, C, D, E, F, H, J), R 5 = (B, C, D, E, F, H, J), R 6 = (B, C, D, E, F, H, J),</formula><p>Let w i = 3 and l i = 1, then c 1 = (seq 1 1 ,seq 1 2 , seq 1  3 , seq 1  4 , seq 1  5 , seq 1  6 , seq 1  7 ), where, seq 1 1 = (A, B, C), seq 1 2 = (B, C, D), seq 1  3 = (C, D, E), seq 1 4 = (D, E, F), seq 1  5 = (E, F, G), seq 1 6 = (F, G, H), seq 1  7 = (F, G, H), At this point, the initial pattern set is obtained. Since then, the pattern set is updated by scanning ? and checking if there is a pattern p i j ofR i , i=2,?,6. If 9 = p i j in ?, p i j is inserted into ? and n i j is increased by 1. Subsequently, p i j?1 is inserted into B i j and p i j?1 to A i j , respectively. If 9 p i j in ?, n i j is increased by 1. Subsequently, B i j and A i j is updated respectively.</p><p>As it can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it is a graphical representation of the inserting and updating process. The arrow in the figure indicates the direction of the transformation between patterns, and the ordinal pair in parentheses indicates the pattern itself and frequency of the pattern. Given the values of w i and l i , the pattern set ? has changed from ; after inserting p 1 j . At this point, each pattern in ? appears for the first time, so the frequency of each pattern is 1. With subsequent data R 2 , ? continues to change and some of the existing patterns appear again to 2 times. With subsequent data R 3 , two new patterns appear, and some of the existing patterns appear up to 3 times. For subsequent data R 4 , R 5 and R 6 , the insertion and update processes follow the same principle.</p><p>According to definition 3, these patterns are used to construct finite state automata which are identified with behavior profile. User behavior generally consists of states and transition condition between states. This is actually a data-driven process. While process is dynamic and active, the data are relatively static and passive. Because normal users are basically consistent with their historical operations in tasks.</p><p>User behavior tends to be composed of several processes that are executed concurrently, where these processes are driven by data to influence user's behavior. The process explains certain phenomenon of user behavior. Data elements are sent from the state sender to the state receiver via an unusual channel, so that the user behavior may be abnormal.</p><p>From the state transition graph in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the user behavior is represented as a state transition system. The system basically consists a set of states together with a set of labelled edges between these states.</p><p>The state here corresponds to the pattern in the pattern set. For example, with the inserting of (A, B, C) into the pattern set, the state (A, B, C) is generated. The arrow indicates the transition direction between the state (A, B, C) and the state (B, C, D). The character of ordinal pair (C, 1) indicates the last command of the transition from state (A, B, C) to state (B, C, D).</p><p>The number 1 of ordinal pair (C, 1) indicates the one time of transition from state (A, B, C) to state (B, C, D). If the state transition occurs again the counter number is simply increased by one. Similarly, add the corresponding state to state transition graph when a new state appears.</p><p>When the training set is large, the automaton is likely to contain hundreds of states and transitions between states. Therefore, it is necessary to simplify the finite automaton effectively by pre-agreed rules.</p><p>(1) If there is only a unique state transition relationship between the two states, the two states are merged into a new state and the starting state is delete. (2) If there is a state transition relationship between one state and multiple states, the state remains and cannot be merged with any state.</p><p>(3) If a state has a state transition relationship with a deleted state, it is reconnected to the generated new state and the state transition label remains.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows a simplified state graph of the finite automaton model on the training set T. The pattern set can be simplified by modifying the A i j and B i j corresponding to p i j in the pattern set record i .</p><p>It is beneficial to do so, which makes the discrete information have the overall structure, and it is more accurate and effective in representing the user behavior profile.</p><p>In general, the relations and frequency information between patterns and the closeness between commands inside the patterns are unified by finite automata.</p><p>In this way, the profile of normal user behavior is easy for subsequent evaluation based on fuzzy logic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Threat Evaluation Using Fuzzy Logic</head><p>In this section, we detect anomalous deviation between the current user behavior and normal user behavior represented by finite automata.</p><p>As users are affected by work content, interest, time, operating environment and other uncertain factors, their behavior is volatile. Therefore, it is difficult to specify exact thresholds for total matches and total mismatches </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Selection of Variables</head><p>In the limited training time or from the limited training data, the finite automata cannot contain all the possible normal behavior patterns of users. From the global perspective, attackers often hope to achieve the purpose of attack in the shortest time. This kind of motivation leads to several mismatches with automaton in a small range. Locally, the fluctuation of user behavior is likely to show up within the pattern. We can consider the closeness between commands in a pattern from the perspective of command combination. If the average command closeness of the two patterns are similar, the two patterns are considered to match.</p><p>Therefore, the construction of fuzzy reasoning system needs to consider the number of match, the number of match continuity, the number of mismatch and the number of mismatch continuity between the current user behavior pattern and the automaton. These four variables are represented by v m , v ms , v um and v ums respectively. The match information and mismatch information are used as premises in fuzzy rules after selecting the fuzzy membership function. v s is derived by v m and v ms , v ns is derived by v um and v ums . Finally, v t is derived by v s and v ns . Then the crisp value can be calculated after the defuzzification process. In addition, user behavior can categorize the final threat into some predefined linguistic terms based on generalized fuzzy number similarity measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The Generation of Fuzzy Rules</head><p>Fuzzy reasoning system is used to describe human knowledge. Knowledge of specific engineering problems Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> The state transition graph of T Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> The state transition reduction graph International Journal of Fuzzy Systems can be divided into explicit knowledge which can be expressed directly in clear language and implicit knowledge which cannot be properly expressed in language. Explicit knowledge directly describes expert knowledge as if-then rules; implicit knowledge generates if-then rules using input and output data. In this section, the combination method is used to generate rules. The emphasis here is on the rules of data generation.</p><p>Rules extraction algorithms based on genetic algorithms and neural networks have complex mechanisms that require continuous iterative learning. This is difficult to implement in engineering problems. Although WM is simple and effective, robustness can still be improved. In structure identification of fuzzy rules, the conceptions of support degree and confidence degree defined in data mining are introduced to improve the fuzzy rule extraction algorithm.</p><p>Given a sample data pair (b x ?p? ;y ?p? ), p=1, 2, ?, N, where b x ?p? ?R n ,y ?p? ?R. Extract the rule from N pairs of data in five steps.</p><p>(1) Divide the fuzzy interval of input and output variables. It is assumed that the interval of x i , i= 1,2, ?,n and y is [ </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x ? i ,x ? i ]?[y ? ,y ? ]</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">T L ={t 1 , ?,t N }. If A(x i )=(A x i 1 , ?,A x i ci</formula><p>) and B(y)=(B y 1 , ?,B y co ) represent the fuzzy set of premise attribute x i , i=1,2, ?,n and conclusion attribute y, respectively. Then for attribute F={A? B}, the set of records can be represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T F ? l F ?t 1 ?; . . .l F ?t N ? f</formula><p>gand the fuzzy records can be saved in the relational table. And now the transformation from D p ? ?x (3) Define fuzzy rule support. From the perspective of data mining, a meaningful rule must have enough support to reflect the support degree of input and output sample data to the rule. Rule support is defined below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Sup(x ) y) = P N p?1 l ?B y lo ? p<label>?y?</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">Q n i?1 l ?A xi li ? p ?x i ? P N p?1 Q n i?1 l ?A xi li ? p ?x i ?<label>?2?</label></formula><p>where *** and *** represent membership function values of relationship record P, N is the number of T F and l i =1, ?,ci. (4) Create rule base using traversal algorithm. The IF part of the rule is determined after all data points are determined in each input sub-interval. The support degree of each output fuzzy set is calculated successively and the maximum support rule of max (sup B k (R i )), k=1, ?,p i is selected. The initial rule base is generated after all input subintervals are traversed. (5) Calculate the trust degree of rules to reduce the initial rule base. More rules in a fuzzy system rule base is not always better. When the number of premise variables and the number of fuzzy set With the increase of the number of variables and the number of fuzzy set segmentation, the number of fuzzy rules will increase exponentially and produce explosion of rule. In order to improve the computing speed of the system, the rule base must be reduced.</p><p>If r ?l? , N 1 and c ?l? represent the weighted average of the output errors, the number of points with non-zero weight, the center value of the rule conclusion for fuzzy sets B ?l? respectively, then the trust of R ?l? is represented as the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">doc?R ?l? ? ? 1 ? r ?l? max N 1 k;t?1 y ?p l k ? ? y ?p l t ? 0 B @ 1 C A<label>?3?</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">r ?l? ? P N 1 k?1 y ?p l k ? ? c ?l? l ?p?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">The Experimental Data</head><p>As this paper is concerned with the insider attacks, we used three sets of data to evaluate our method. These experimental data were obtained from AT&amp;T Shannon lab data set, Purdue university data set and self-collected data set.</p><p>Data set from AT&amp;T Shannon lab, also called SEA data set, covers 70 Unix users. among which 50 users are randomly selected as target users and 20 users as intruders. The dataset consists of 50 text files, each containing 15,000 commands for each user. The first 5000 of these 15,000 commands are normal user data, and the remaining 20 user commands are injected into 10,000 commands with a certain probability. Each user's data are divided into 150 blocks of 100 command lengths. Each command block is made up of legitimate user commands or illegal user commands without mixing. The first third of each user command block is used to train the user's normal behavior model, and the remaining two-thirds of the command block is used for testing. The distribution of malicious data in SEA data set has a statistical rule. The probability of containing malicious commands is 1% for any given command block to be tested. When a command block contains malicious commands, its subsequent command block also contains malicious commands 80% of the time.</p><p>The Purdue university experimental data set contains two years of command history for eight UNIX users. The command name and parameters, host name, file name, URL, directory and other information are retained in the preprocessing of the original data, which is replaced by\ n[. The various command symbols are arranged in the order in which they appear in the session. Sessions start and end with the symbols **SOF** and **EOF**, respectively.</p><p>The data collected by ourselves are closer to the real data, and the attack intention of this group of data is more obvious than the first two groups of data. The data collection process lasted five months and was divided into two stages. In the first stage, ten trusted terminals using the Kylin operating system are selected from the independent and credible information system we built. Ten staff members, each corresponding to a trusted computer, perform operation tasks with different administrative permissions, network monitoring permissions and task execution permissions on specified computer. This phase lasted for three months, and the data collected from each trusted terminal were used to train finite normal user profile. In the second stage, each trusted computing terminal rotates operators 5 times in turn. During the rotation period, operators on the trusted terminal always use SSH, Telnet, Ftp and other remote access methods to access other trusted terminals or trusted redundant servers to create new accounts, upgrade permissions or conduct direct attacks. This phase lasts for two months, and each trusted terminal collects data as illegal data. The experimental data preprocessing method are consistent with Purdue university.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Comparison with Some Other Methods</head><p>Window size affects algorithm performance. When the value of window is too small, the temporal relationship  between states represented by patterns will be lost, and the situation is increasing that the closeness value between commands equals 0. When the value of the window is too big, the commands that are not often used together appear in a window, and local information is lost between the sequential patterns that represent states. No matter what kind of information loss, it will make the comprehensive detection performance worse. Considering comprehensively, the user behavior information loss is the least when the window sizes are 4, 6 and 8. The average number of states of 50 users is 123, and the average number of transitions between states is 510. Let q MR , q FAR , and q HR represent missing rate, false alarm rate and hitting rate. q HR and q FAR restrict each other. The higher q HR is, the higher q FAR is. Therefore, we want to increase the q HR in the case that q FAR is acceptable. The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is commonly used as a general standard for detecting accuracy. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> that when the window size is appropriate, the influence of the window size on the experimental results is not obvious. When n=6, the q MR is the lowest and the q FAR is the highest, for any q FAR but a few.</p><p>In literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, comprehensive evaluation formula of detection performance Cost=aq MR +bq FAR is adopted to measure the detection performance of various methods. In this calculation formula, a \ b means false alarms have more weight. Given a = 1,b = 6, the smaller the Cost value is, the stronger the model detection ability is.</p><p>The method in this paper will be compared with nine methods. Among these methods, method N. Bayes method comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, method closeness from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>, sequence-to sequence model and other methods from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. For the convenience of comparison, the evaluation results of the proposed method and other methods are all obtained under the same thresholds of parameters.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> summarizes comparison results of comprehensive detection performance between our method and other nine methods. These two methods, Compression method and Sequence Matching method, respectively consider the detection problem from the aspect of data reversibility and similarity matching degree, and fail to consider the sequence characteristic between commands. The missing alarm and comprehensive detection performance are the first two poor ones. The IPMA method and Hybrid Markov method is complicated due to investigating transition characteristics of user commands one by one. Although the q FAR of IPMA method and Hybrid Markov method is 2.7% and 3.2%, the q MR is 58.9% and 50.7%. The q MR of Bayes 1-step Markov method is 30.7% and the q FAR is 6.7%. The comprehensive test performance evaluation formula has a high value, so the test performance is poor. Since this method looks at the frequency of rarely used commands, the q MR of uniqueness method is 60.7% and the q FAR is 1.4%. But this requires statistics for all the commands that the user used. N.bayes belongs to Naive Bayesian method in essence, and it has good noise tolerance and fast calculation, but the false alarm rate is too high. Therefore, the comprehensive detection performance is not good. The closeness method extracts user behavior patterns from the perspective of command combination. It shows good detection performance under different closeness thresholds, but it ignores the characteristics of attack intensity. That is, the attacker will complete the attack task in the shortest possible time, and try to behave normally in the rest of the time. The q HR , q MR and q FAR of Sequence-to-Sequence model are respectively 72.5%, 27.5% and 7.0%. Using the formula of cost, we can get the value is 69.5%. In terms of data, we can see that the neural network model has a high prediction accuracy under the condition that data is enough, but the comprehensive evaluation effect is also reduced due to the high rate of false positives. The proposed method considers fault tolerance both in and out of the state represented by command sequences. It is necessary to be able to distinguish the reasonable behavior fluctuation of users and to identify the attack behavior of users in a short period of time. Although the method proposed in this paper has higher comprehensive detection performance than the previous methods, false alarm rate and missing alarm rate are still not ideal. The main reason is that all users adopt the same threshold and fuzzy membership function.</p><p>Different thresholds and fuzzy membership functions are not used for each different user. This lose the personality that makes each user different from the others. In the formula Cost=aq MR + bq FAR , q FAR contributes more to Cost. In reality, system managers are more concerned about the detection rate of masquerader, and false alarms may be detected by other detection mechanisms in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> The q HR of 50 users International Journal of Fuzzy Systems system. Therefore, the comprehensive test rate evaluation formula closer to the reality can be used in the comprehensive evaluation of test performance. Therefore, performance detection using DR=q HR ?(1-q FAR ) is closer to the real situation. Here, the first 5000 commands of each user of 50 users in SEA data set are still used for training finite automata. The remaining 10,000 commands per user are still divided into 100 copies, each for adjusting parameters and setting membership functions. For each of the 50 users, the first 5000 commands for each of the other 49 users were used as masquerader data. In this way, the amount of abnormal data for each user used in the test reaches 2,450, which is much larger than the amount of data in the last experiment. The total number of normal test cases with 50 users for parameter adjustment is 4769. 277 test samples were flagged as intruders throughout the test. So q FAR is equal to 5.58%. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, the q HR of 37 out of 50 users is higher than 90%. Users 13 and 32 hit just over 20.00%. After analyzing and comparing the data used in the user training, there are two reasons for the low hit rate. First, some of the short sequence patterns that appear in these users are frequently present in multiple other users. This leaves these users without enough sequences to train models that are different from other users, leading to lower hit rates with higher levels of repetition. Second, these users tend to use extremely rare command sequences. The more rare they are, the less likely they are to be used by other users, which leads to low detection rate when using other users' data for experiments. The high false alarm rate of some users is caused by concept drift, and the pattern is not updated with time. In general, if the command information used in modeling can be more abundant, then false alarm rate will be effectively reduced and detection rate will be improved.</p><p>The following experiment adopted the experimental data of Purdue university. In this experiment, eight users were selected. The first 5000 commands of each user were used to train the finite automata model, and the next 5000 commands were used to adjust threshold parameters and membership functions. The last 5000 commands remaining per user are used to test the false alarm rate. The window size of the finite automaton is set to 6. Each user masquerader data consist of the first 5000 command characters per user for the remaining seven users. As the command characters of this experiment are more abundant than those of the previous experiment, 50 command characters are selected as the block length. Therefore, the total number of abnormal test samples per user is 7*(5000/50)=700. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> lists the number of finite automata states and the   number of transitions between states for the eight users. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> shows that the average hit rate of the eight users is 89.86%, the average missing rate is 10.19%, the average false alarm rate was 5.00%, and the average comprehensive detection rate is 85.37%. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref> shows that the mean value of detection rate false alarm rate and comprehensive detection rate change with the block length. When the length of block changes from 25 to 50, the average hit rate and false alarm rate increase simultaneously, and the mean value of comprehensive detection rate also increases. When the length of test samples changes from 50 to 75, the average hit rate decreases, the average false alarm rate continues to increase, and the average comprehensive detection rate decreases. When the length of block is 100, the average hit rate continues to decrease, the average false alarm rate continues to increase, and the average comprehensive detection rate continues to decrease. The length increases from small to large, and the average hit rate and false alarm rate increase simultaneously. However, when length of block exceeds a certain threshold, the repeated patterns increase rapidly, leading to a decline in the average detection rate and an increase in the mean value of false alarm rate. This means that the richer the command character, the more likely it is to help identify masquerader in the shortest possible time, suitable for deployment in a real system.</p><p>The following experiments were carried out on data set. In this experiment, the trapezoidal fuzzy number similarity method was adopted to detect the anomaly, and the user behaviors corresponding to the threat level at the levels of moderately high, high, very high and absolutely high were marked as abnormal. Accordingly, users whose threat levels correspond to absolute low, very low, low, moderately low and medium are marked as normal. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref> lists the nine threat levels represented by trapezoidal fuzzy number. Here, half of the 15,000 normal command of each trusted terminal user in the first stage are extracted to construct the finite automaton model, and the other half is used to adjust parameters, determine membership function and test false alarm rate. In the second stage, 6000 commands of each rotator were treated as abnormal data. When the size of test samples was selected as 25, 50, 75 and 100, respectively, the number of abnormal test samples was 1200, 600, 400 and 300, respectively. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref> lists the values of q HR , q FAR , q MR and DR in the independent and credible information system when the sample length is 50. Among them, the q FAR is 6.00% of no. 6 user, and the minimum is 3.33% of no. 5 user. Accordingly, the maximum q HR of no.6 user is 99.83%, and the minimum q HR of no. 5 user is 86.67%. Combined with other user data, can when the detection rate is high, the failure rate is correspondingly high. This conforms to the rules of the ROC curve. False alarm rate and hit rate correspond to growth trend is consistent, only there some fluctuations. The average missing rate, average hit rate, average false alarm rate and average comprehensive detection rate of 10 users are 8.33%, 91.67%, 4.53% and 86.87%, respectively. The detection performance is better than that in Purdue university data set. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> compares the detection performance at different length. It can be observed that since the data of the independent and credible information system is real data, it has more attack characteristics than the simulated data of Purdue university. So the results were better than those from Purdue university. When the test sample length is 50, the average DR performs best, which is higher than other lengths. When the test sample length is 25, the average q FAR is 4.3%, but the average q HR is not the highest. Therefore, the DR is not the highest. When the test sample length exceeds 50, the hit rate does not continue to increase like false alarm rate, but starts to decrease. The main reason is that at this time, the short sequence pattern used to construct the finite automaton starts to increase sharply and appear repeatedly. In reality, attackers usually hope to achieve their attacking purpose in the shortest time. Therefore, the test sample length should be reduced as much as possible under the condition of ensuring the detection performance. This is advantageous to discover the abnormality as soon as possible. The final results show that the detection method proposed in this chapter has strong practicability, fault tolerance and detection ability, and can meet the application requirements of real systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a fuzzy approach to userlevel intrusion detection. Aiming at the complexity and fluctuation of user behavior, this method utilizes closeness information of commands within patterns, timing sequence and frequency information between patterns, and adopts finite automata to represent the normal behavior profile of users in training phase. This allows discrete data used for training to have a holistic structure that allows for a more accurate expression of the normal behavior of the user. In the detection stage, for current sequence, our method builds a threat evaluation system using fuzzy logic. The reasoning system can tolerate user behavior fluctuation. Experimental results on data sets of Purdue University, SEA and selfcollected data show that an accurate, effective and efficient detection can be achieved using the proposed approach.</p><p>In the future, information interaction and resource sharing between different management domains and different collaboration units will become more frequent. User across-domain behavior will be more complex. This will change the user's behavior profiles significantly. This requires extracting more useful information such as GUIbased information, internet-based information, mouse clicking information and other biological information. Future work would address the problem that how to construct fuzzy system based on this information.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Updating process of pattern set</figDesc></figure>
