<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>focused with most studies being conducted using hypothetico-deductive approaches, whereas reference discipline is perhaps the most diverse of the characteristics examined. An interesting finding is that IS itself emerged as a key reference discipline in the late 1990s. The Journal of Management Information Systems and Information Systems Research publish articles displaying the greatest diversity, and MIS Quarterly and Decision Sciences publish articles that focus on subsets of the field. Our research provides a foundation for addressing the direction that diversity in the IS discipline takes over time. In the shorter term, researchers can use our classification system as a guide to writing abstracts and selecting key words, and the findings of our journal analyses to determine the best outlet for their type of research.</p><p>KEY WORDS AND PHRASES: information systems journals, information systems research, information systems research diversity, level of analysis, reference discipline, research methods. THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS (IS) FIELD is by most accounts less than four decades old. Yet organizations have become increasingly dependent on their systems not only for their management needs but also to remain competitive in the current era <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref>. Great strides have been made, for example, in developing applications to support every aspect of business, in making data available throughout the organization, in supporting the computing needs of all organizational members, and in enabling new forms of business.</p><p>The academic discipline of IS, which parallels IS in industry, seeks to further the field by developing theory that creates, captures, and records knowledge, and by educating newcomers to the field. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that the first IS programs were established at the Universities of Pennsylvania and Minnesota, and MIT during the late 1960s (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). Since its inception, the field has engaged in extensive self-examination.</p><p>An ongoing debate in the discipline of IS has centered on what constitutes the IS field. A discipline is defined by its core theories, and from a broader perspective by its body of knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The range of views on what constitutes IS is due, at least in part, to the fact that IS is an applied discipline and therefore uses, redefines, and potentially redevelops the theories developed in other disciplines to further knowledge related to its own issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. The IS discipline derives certain of its theories from computer science on one hand, and from organizational behavior and organizational theory on the other. Further, the design and development of IS requires problem solving; hence, theories in cognitive psychology are also applicable. Furthermore, IS affects, and are affected by, society. These reference disciplines bring with them a set of topics, problems, and issues important in the parent discipline, which may also be addressed in the applied context, as well as a set of accepted research approaches and research methods for addressing them <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. All of these factors contribute to the difference in focus of members of the IS community. Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015</p><p>More recently, the continuing debate on what constitutes, or should constitute, IS has crystallized in notions of diversity (see, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71]</ref>). Benbasat and Weber <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> define diversity as the diversity in the problems, theoretical foundations and reference disciplines, and the methods that we use in IS research. The major concern has been with how diversity might affect the progress of the IS field <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>. Would the field be best served by steering it in certain well-defined directions, or should researchers have full rein?</p><p>Despite the large volume of rhetoric on the issue, no research to date has attempted to analyze the diversity of the field empirically. As a first step toward better understanding the diversity of the IS field, we conducted a study designed to assess the current state of IS research diversity, and the extent to which diversity is universal across journals that publish IS research. Our overall research question is: How diverse is IS research? To answer this question, we first developed a classification system that captures five important characteristics of diversity; we then investigated the diversity in the field as evidenced by publications in the major IS journals over the 1995 to 1999 period. We also examined the diversity of the journals themselves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED both the philosophical issues surrounding progress in academic disciplines such as IS and the existing state of the IS field. We first examine those studies and then describe our approach to studying diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior Studies</head><p>Following an analysis of the arguments both for and against diversity in research investigations, we review studies that, at least implicitly, have sought to address diversity in IS research from a number of different perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diversity in Academic Research</head><p>The issue of diversity in research centers on the philosophical view that one holds of scientific progress. There are two overriding views, which we will term "internalist" and "externalist," in keeping with Westin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref>. These views are intended to be both descriptive and normative. The internalist argument is perhaps best conveyed by Kuhn's <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref> notion that scientific progress is evolutionary and characterized by what he calls periods of "normal science," interspersed with periods of revolution. At any point in time, a discipline may have a paradigm that represents its current thinking and that facilitates communication among researchers. During periods of normal science, the members of the community adhering to a particular paradigm focus on solving problems that lie within the paradigm. Such investigation continues until an existing paradigm is overturned by the sheer weight of contrary evidence and the old paradigm is replaced by a new, more appropriate one (given current knowledge). This view is supported by Hagstrom <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> and Cole and Cole <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015</p><p>The externalist argument is perhaps best conveyed by Whitley <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref>. Whitley's arguments are based in the belief that many of the factors that influence the choice of research issues, as well as the research methods used to address them, do not stem from the field itself, but originate from outside of the field. As we have seen in the case of IS, researchers draw upon theories and methods developed in organizational studies, cognitive psychology, and sociology, among others. The proponents of the externalist perspective, therefore, instead of viewing a discipline as a collection of well-defined research areas, view it as a complex network of interacting researchers whose ideas may stem from a number of disciplines and who therefore form an intellectual community. This view is supported by Bernal <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Nagi and Corwin <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. Note that Banville and Landry <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Landry and Banville <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> applied Whitley's notions to classify the IS field as a "fragmented adhocracy." Such a field is characterized by low functional dependence (that is, there is low reliance on findings of prior studies), low strategic dependence among researchers (that is, there is little need to convince colleagues of the significance of one's research), and high strategic task uncertainty (that is, there is no agreed-upon hierarchy of research problems to investigate).</p><p>The ongoing debate on whether diversity in research is to be courted or shunned as a sign of academic maturity has arisen in other disciplines. Benbasat and Weber <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, for example, cite Pfeffer's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68]</ref> in organization science to support their internalist arguments for IS. Robey <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>, on the other hand, cites the externalist Van Maanen <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">76]</ref>, one of Pfeffer's harshest critics. What appears to characterize both IS and organization science is that they are "social" sciences. And what characterizes the social sciences most from the perspective of diversity may be the fact that a multiplicity of paradigms is necessary to address the phenomena within its purview. Given that IS is also an applied discipline, we believe that a significant amount of diversity can be expected in both IS research issues and the associated research approaches and methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior Research Addressing "Diversity" in IS Research</head><p>Although no study of which we are aware has addressed diversity directly, numerous studies have sought to characterize the "maturity" of IS from different perspectives and therefore, in some sense, to assess "diversity." The majority of research to date has taken an internalist stance. Such studies are often couched in terms of the "intellectual development of the field" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref> or some part of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>, "the intellectual structure of MIS" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, the evolution of IS <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>, or building a cumulative research tradition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This type of inquiry is most often achieved by examining reference disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">88]</ref> or research methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>. The article by Cheon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is alone in the articles we reviewed in that it takes an externalist position in stating that maturity in IS research will be signaled by increasing diversity. In general, the majority of such studies have found that IS research has matured over time, for example, by engaging in more empirical research <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58]</ref> and by conducting explanatory rather than descriptive surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015</head><p>In more general studies, Swanson and Ramiller <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref> and Hirschheim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> conclude, however, that the IS field is a fragmented adhocracy, as suggested by Banville and Landry <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, thus supporting the notion that the field currently has an externalist stance as evidenced by its (relatively) recent publications. Focusing on underlying themes and reference disciplines, Swanson and Ramiller <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref> conducted in-depth analyses of papers submitted to the (then) upcoming journal, Information Systems Research, from 1987 to 1992. They report that IS borrowed more from reference disciplines than it contributed to the core literature of those disciplines during that time period. 1 In presenting an integrated framework that can be used to understand diverse research on IS development, Hirschheim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> suggest that such diversity will persist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Study</head><p>Our position in this study is to take neither an internalist nor an externalist perspective with regard to the debate on the merits or demerits of diversity in IS research, but simply to report facts pertaining to diversity in the IS field. Our examination is therefore descriptive rather than normative. Further, we take a broad perspective of the field in addressing the body of IS knowledge as represented in publications in mainstream journals, rather than a narrow perspective by addressing its core theories exclusively (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>).</p><p>Although many studies have addressed various aspects of diversity, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the diversity of the field. To conduct such an evaluation, we need, first, to determine how to capture diversity; that is, to determine the key characteristics of diversity. We then need to determine how to assess each of the characteristics identified. In this section, we present the characteristics of diversity examined in this study, and the third section addresses the assessment of each of the diversity characteristics.</p><p>We used Benbasat and Weber's notions of diversity as a starting point for our study. According to these authors, the IS discipline is characterized by "three types of diversity: (a) diversity in the problems addressed; (b) diversity in the theoretical foundations and reference disciplines used to account for IS phenomena; and (c) diversity in the methods used to collect, analyze, and interpret data" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We added two further areas of research diversity to these characteristics. We subdivided "research method" into the generic approach taken toward the research and the specific research method used. The research approach might be "descriptive" or "evaluative" in nature, and, if evaluative, the approach taken could be either positivist or interpretivist. The research method might be a field study, a laboratory experiment, or an ethnographic study. Further, we also examined the level of analysis; that is, whether a study addresses an individual or individuals, an organization, or a project, for example. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the support for each of the characteristics examined and the research questions addressed in this study.</p><p>Our study addresses the diversity of the IS field as a whole, as well as the diversity of the journals under examination.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IS field are IS journals in the reference</head><p>According to Robey <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>, IS is a social science and, like all social disciplines they publish? sciences, is characterized by the multiplicity of paradigms necessary to explain all the phenomena of interest.</p></div>

Citation studies, which examine references to cited articles, have been used almost exclusively to assess the degree of reliance of IS on other disciplinary areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research</head><p>Because we wished to do a comprehensive study of diversity in IS research, we chose the classification approach for our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice of Journals</head><p>To answer the research questions identified in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">82]</ref>). We also examined Decision Sciences (DS) because it publishes a substantial number of IS articles per year and receives a relatively high ranking in many of the studies cited above. In both Management Science and Decision Sciences we coded only those articles that we considered to be IS articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification System</head><p>Our next task was to create a classification system that would allow us to capture the diversity in IS research. In creating our classification system, we had a broader agenda than evaluating the diversity of IS research; we also wanted to develop a system that would encompass the three computing-related disciplines of computer science, software engineering, and IS <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[79]</ref>. Such a system would thus allow comparisons of the similarities and differences among the three disciplines. Similar to Vogel and Wetherbe <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref>, we strove to create a scheme that was both comprehensive and parsimonious. The following sections describe the way in which we captured diversity in terms of the characteristics identified in the second section: reference discipline, level of analysis, topic, research approach, and research method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classifying Reference Discipline</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> presents the reference disciplines examined in this research, together with literature support for those categories. In general, the categories represent a comprehensive aggregation of the categories addressed in prior research, that is, some of our categories subsumed one or more of the categories suggested by prior researchers. Furthermore, Table 2 also presents the categories of IS, "other," and "not applicable," and their definitions, which are categories considered for the first time in this research. Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015</p><p>One of the limitations of prior studies into reference disciplines-which, as we saw earlier, have typically used citation analysis data (see, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>)-is that they do not account for why a particular article is cited. Authors may cite numerous references when motivating their research; however, the core theory underlying the paper often comes from a few key references, which may be quite different from the references used to introduce the research (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). We identified the reference discipline on which an article is based by looking at the theories/papers the authors used to formulate their model or hypotheses; that is, we classified a paper as belonging to a particular reference discipline when it predominantly cited other papers from that discipline as the source of its theories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classifying Level of Analysis</head><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref> presents the levels of analysis addressed in this study together with literature support for those categories.

In particular, we used the classification system proposed by Glass as the starting point for arriving at the high-level categories shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> because its stated objective of "presenting a comprehensive set of topics taught in the fields of Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Information Systems" <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> best fit our completeness criterion.</p><p>Because IS researchers, in particular, may not research the topics they teach, we recognized the need to expand some of the categories, especially the organizational concepts category.

At the same time, we sought to develop a set of comprehensive topic categories based on conceptually distinct principles.

This approach, however, is error prone because authors frequently list several topics in their key word list/abstracts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Classification Process and Coding Reliability</head><p>We classified each article using just one category for each diversity characteristic. Two of the three researchers independently classified each of the articles. During the early stages of the classification process, the researchers coded 20 articles in each sitting. Each coding session was followed by a resolution session where disagreements in the coded data were resolved and recorded. After classifying and resolving the coding for approximately 100 articles, the researchers resolved differences following the coding of approximately every 60 articles. Inter-rater reliabilities were assessed for each of the categories using Cohen's kappa <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which adjusts the raw agreement to account for the possibility of agreement occurring by chance. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> presents the results of the reliability analyses. Perusal of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> shows kappa values ranging from 0.7215 for organizational topic to 0.8189 for research method. The levels of agreement across all categories are highly significant. According to Landis and Koch <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>, kappa values between 0.61 and 0.80 are regarded as "substantial," whereas those equal to or greater than 0.81 are regarded as "almost perfect." The reliability of five of our six sets of classifications was therefore on the high side of "substantial," whereas the sixth was "almost perfect."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Diversity and Representativeness</head><p>We present the analysis for each diversity characteristic, overall and by journal, in three ways, each of which corresponds to a subset of a research question (for example, Research Question 1a, 1b, or 1c). First, tables present the levels of representation as specific data values. The data are presented in four categories to highlight the patterns of diversity among the entities studied: (1) above the mean of the data set;</p><p>(2) between one-half of the mean and the mean; (3) up to one-half of the mean; and (4) by default, absent (see, for example, Table <ref type="table">8</ref> for Research Question 1a). Note that this representation, which presents the data in both discrete and visual form, serves two purposes: (1) it facilitates retrieving factual data, and (2) enables the reader to comprehend at a glance the distribution of entries over the various categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref>. Second, to facilitate comparison, we used standard deviations to evaluate quantitatively the diversity of each characteristic. A characteristic displays maximum diversity when all categories are represented equally. In this case, the standard deviation of the entries in the various categories will be zero. Lower standard deviations therefore reflect greater diversity, and vice versa. We calculated the overall diversity for a characteristic as well as for each journal.</p><p>Third, we also calculated the representativeness of a journal on each of the characteristics. The representativeness measure informs us how the publications of a particular journal mirror the publications in the field. We assumed that the journals examined Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015 represent the IS field and evaluated the representativeness of a journal on a given characteristic by measuring the difference in diversity of the journal from that of the field. Finally, we calculated the overall diversity and representativeness of a journal. We did this by adding the journal rankings across each of the characteristics, thereby weighting each of the characteristics equally in this analysis.</p><p>Findings <ref type="bibr">TABLE 9</ref> PRESENTS RAW DATA for the number of articles examined in each of the five journals in the five-year period from 1995 to 1999. The number of articles varies considerably by journal with publications in JMIS exceeding by almost 63 percent those published in ISR, the journal with the second highest numbers. Further, 12.3 percent more articles were published in 1997 than in the other years, on average. In the analyses that follow, all of the data are normalized as percentages to facilitate comparison of publications across journals. Researchers considering a single journal in isolation should keep in mind the raw number of publications in each journal.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> shows that IS publications are based largely in nine reference disciplines; the mean is therefore 11.1 percent. Table <ref type="table">8</ref> shows that three reference disciplines were above the mean: more than 27.2 percent of the articles examined used IS as their principal reference discipline, with management next at 18.2 percent, followed by economics at 11.1 percent (Research Question 1a).</p><p>In MISQ, JMIS, and DS, the predominant theoretical base was IS, followed by management. The highest representation of IS-based publications was in DS, followed by MISQ and JMIS. ISR and MS, on the other hand, exhibited quite a different pattern. In ISR, management and cognitive psychology were equally represented, followed by economics and IS, which were tied for third. In MS, economics was the principal reference discipline, followed by management science, with management third. The representation of IS-based articles in MS was extremely low.</p><p>ISR was the most diverse journal from the viewpoint of its theoretical base (SD = 5.48). JMIS and MS were almost equally diverse (SDs of 9.02 and 9.72, respectively), whereas DS and MISQ (SDs of 11.73 and 13.48, respectively) were less diverse than the other journals (Research Question 1b).

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">10</ref> shows that three levels of analysis exceeded the mean: organizational at 25.6 percent, individual at 23.8 percent, and group at 10.9 percent.</p><p>The majority of articles in all journals were positioned at the organization and individual levels. In all cases except DS and MS, organization was higher than individual, mirroring the overall figures. Group was the third most prevalent level of analysis in the three dedicated IS journals (in MISQ, joint with interorganizational). In DS, project and abstract concept were jointly third, with abstract concept third in MS. Group and computer system were much higher in JMIS than in the other journals. Project was much higher in DS. MS published papers with the lower levels of analysis (for example, more technically focused levels such as abstract concept and computing element) well represented (Research Question 2a).</p><p>MS has the lowest standard deviation from the mean (SD = 6.79), indicating that it published articles across the spectrum of levels to a greater extent than the other journals examined. JMIS is the next most diverse journal (SD = 7.63). With its heavy focus on organizational and individual levels, MISQ is the least diverse journal (SD = 11.15) (Research Question 2b). ISR is again the journal that is most representative of the field as a whole, followed by JMIS, MS, DS, and MISQ, respectively (Research Question 2c).</p></div>

Organizational concepts far outweighed other topics in all journals. Topics other than organizational topics were published most frequently in JMIS and ISR. Problem domain-specific concepts was the second most-published topic area in four of the five journals, exceeding the mean in all; MISQ, on the other hand, published almost no articles of this nature. The second most-published topic in MISQ was systems/software management, followed by Disciplinary Issues. The third mostpublished topic across journals other than MISQ was systems/software. Although MISQ published articles in a number of the topic areas, the proportions were extremely low. Overall, DS and MS published articles in fewer topics than the dedicated IS journals (Research Question 3a).</p><p>In conducting the diversity and representativeness analyses, we discarded the category of computer concepts. Note the very high standard deviations in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">11</ref>, which indicate that neither the field as a whole, nor the journals themselves, publish uniformly across the set of topics examined. JMIS has the lowest standard deviation from the mean (21.56), indicating that it publishes a broader set of topics than the other journals, followed closely by MS and ISR (SDs of 21.87 and 22.41, respectively). MISQ is the least diverse journal from the viewpoint of topic (SD = 26.19), followed by DS (SD = 24.38) (Research Question 3b).

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">5</ref> shows that IS publications are based in seven categories; the mean is therefore 14.3 percent. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">13</ref> shows that two research approaches exceeded the mean: evaluative-deductive at 46.7 percent and evaluative-other at 15.4 percent. Three other research approaches followed somewhat closely: formulative-model at 12.5 percent and formulative-other at 11.7 percent.</p><p>Evaluative-deductive was the largest category in all journals. Formulative-model was a close second in MS and a distant second in ISR. Evaluative-other was the second most prevalent research approach found in MISQ, JMIS, and DS. All of the above categories were present at levels above the mean. Formulative-other was the third most-published research approach in all journals and overall, although the proportion in DS was less than one-half that in other journals. Articles using interpretive approaches (EI) were published more frequently in MISQ and ISR than in the other journals. Articles published in DS fall almost exclusively into two evaluative research approaches-evaluative-deductive and evaluative-other.</p><p>Note, again, that the standard deviations in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">13</ref> are quite high, suggesting that neither the field as a whole nor the journals themselves is diverse with respect to the research approach. ISR has the lowest standard deviation from the mean (SD = 14.51), followed closely by JMIS (SD = 14.55), indicating that they are the most diverse journals from this perspective. MS follows with a standard deviation of 14.76, and MISQ of 15.04. DS is, however, by far the least diverse journal based on the research approach (SD = 23.79) (Research Question 4b).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings for Research Method</head><p>Research Question 5 addresses the research methods used in IS research. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> shows that IS publications are based in eight categories; the mean is therefore 12.5 percent. Examination of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">14</ref> indicates that four categories exceeded the mean: field study at 26.8 percent, laboratory experiment at 19.1 percent, conceptual analysis at 14.8 percent, and case study at 13.7 percent. Conceptual analysis/mathematical followed closely at 12.3 percent.</p><p>There was considerable variation in the most-used categories across journals. Note that JMIS, ISR, and DS published articles using all of the research methods. Field study and laboratory experiment were above the mean in all five journals; conceptual analysis was above the mean in all journals except DS where it was less than one-half of the mean. Case study was above the mean in MISQ and JMIS, though not in ISR, nor in the niche journals, DS and MS. MISQ published more than twice as many articles using a case study method as any other journal.</p><p>Quantitative analysis reveals that ISR has the lowest standard deviation from the mean (SD = 7.74), indicating that it is the most diverse journal from the viewpoint of Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015 Discussion and Implications OUR PRIMARY AIM IN CONDUCTING THIS ANALYSIS of IS research was to establish the current state of the field and its journals from the viewpoint of key aspects of diversity.</p><p>Our first task was to develop a comprehensive classification of the characteristics of diversity in IS research on which to base our analysis. The classification system includes certain characteristics acknowledged as indicative of diversity in prior literature: reference disciplines, topics, and research methods. In addition, we addressed two important distinctions not found in the majority of the earlier literature-the level of analysis at which the research was conducted and the research approach used. We addressed level of analysis because it is a key decision that IS researchers must make when conducting an IS study. We addressed the research approach due to concerns arising in the early 1990s regarding the limited epistemological bases used in IS research (see, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>). To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first effort to create and use such a comprehensive classification system. It is important to note, however, that the categories themselves will change as the field evolves. This evolution may be most apparent in the need for new/different categories of research topics. We analyzed data on 488 IS articles in the five leading IS journals over the period from 1995 to 1999. Several aspects of our approach to coding are worth highlighting for their potential use in subsequent research of this nature. First, we based our coding on complete articles rather than using key words, abstracts, or citations. Key words and abstracts are often not written with classification studies in mind, and therefore do not reference all the characteristics of interest, whereas use of citations begs the question of the purpose of the citation. Second, our coding of reference disciplines, which is based on identifying the literature that motivates the theory/ hypothesis development in the paper, allows us to understand IS researchers' dependence on reference disciplines better than prior studies, which used counts of the number of articles referenced in journals of a given discipline. Third, we formally coded the data using dual coders to assess reliability. By using Cohen's kappa to correct for chance agreement, we applied a stronger test of coding reliability than has been used in past studies, attesting to the fact that the results of our study are reproducible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diversity in IS Research</head><p>Table <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> presents the categories most often found in the articles examined (those above the mean) in each of the diversity characteristics in this time period, both overall and by journal, whereas Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">16</ref> summarizes the findings for each research question. Perusal of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">15</ref> reveals that in the five leading IS journals over the five-year Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015   Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015 period: (1) IS, itself, represents the major reference discipline used as the theoretical basis for the studies; 6 (2) the majority of studies are conducted at the organization level, with the individual level also heavily represented; (3) the topics addressed are largely organizational in nature; IT usage/operations is the organizational topic most frequently addressed; (4) most studies are conducted using a hypothetico-deductive research approach (evaluative-deductive in this study); and (5) the most common research method is the field study.</p><p>A key contribution of our study is the characterization of the five journals based on the diversity characteristics examined. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">15</ref> shows that there is considerable similarity across journals with respect to the major category (and sometimes more than one category) in each of the diversity characteristics examined, with the exception of reference discipline and research method. For example, organizational research topics were the most common in all journals, as was the hypothetico-deductive research approach. Considerable differences are revealed, however, if one takes into consideration the complete set of categories examined for each of the diversity characteristics, as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">15</ref> shows.</p><p>From the viewpoint of the overall diversity of the five leading IS journals (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">16</ref>), it is clear that ISR, JMIS, and MS are quite eclectic, and therefore diverse, whereas MISQ and DS are much more focused. Our analysis revealed that ISR was the most diverse journal on three of the five diversity characteristics-reference discipline, research approach, and research method-with JMIS the most diverse on topic, and MS the most diverse on level of analysis. A quantitative measure of the diversity and representativeness of the five IS journals as a whole was obtained by summing the ranks for the individual characteristics. These findings show that ISR and JMIS are equally diverse, followed quite closely by MS. MISQ and DS are by far the least diverse journals, with DS slightly less diverse than MISQ.</p><p>From the viewpoint of representativeness, although JMIS was the only journal that mirrored the field in the major categories of each of the characteristics examined (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">15</ref>), our analysis revealed that ISR and JMIS are equally representative of the field, followed quite closely by MS; DS is much less representative, followed closely by MISQ. ISR was the most representative journal on two diversity characteristics, Level of analysis and topic, whereas JMIS was the most representative on reference discipline and research method; MISQ was the most representative on research approach as well as on organizational topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Before discussing the implications of our findings, the limitations of our study need to be noted. The major limitation of this study lies in the journals chosen for examination. The analyses reported are representative of the IS field to the extent that the journals examined are representative of the field. In this study, we examined journals acknowledged as being the leading journals in the IS field by researchers who were largely based in North America. We chose this approach due to the difficulty of otherwise determining a set of journals that would cover all aspects of the field equally, the Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015 large number of journals that would doubtless have resulted, and therefore the extent of the coding effort that would have been required.</p><p>The choice of journals may influence findings in two areas, in particular. First, from the viewpoint of topic, IS relies on journals of other computing-related disciplines, such as computer science and software engineering, to publish more technically focused articles. The journals examined may not, therefore, truly represent the full range of research publications in the IS field.</p><p>Second, from the viewpoint of the research approach, it is generally accepted that researchers on other continents use qualitative research approaches (for example, interpretive studies) to a greater extent than U.S.-based researchers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). Nonetheless, Walsham, in a 1995 article <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>, reported that eight well-regarded journals, including MISQ and ISR, encouraged submission of articles using interpretive approaches in the early 1990s. There is some question, however, regarding the quality of the research presented for publication, which may explain the low numbers of published articles of this nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Although we have no reason, ex ante, to expect regional differences in any of the other diversity characteristics, caution should nonetheless be exercised in generalizing the findings of this study beyond the journals examined.</p><p>A further limitation lies in the fact that we recorded only the predominant category for each of the diversity characteristics. Hence, whereas an article might have targeted primarily process management (under systems/software management concepts) and secondarily examined IT impact (in organizational concepts), we recorded the topic as the one we saw as dominating-in this case, process management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>Our findings have a number of implications for the IS discipline and for IS researchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for the IS Discipline</head><p>Here we address issues related to the debate on diversity in the IS discipline and the impact of diversity on IS journals.</p><p>Implications for the Debate on Diversity. This research shows that it is important to differentiate among the different aspects of diversity that one is addressing. Diversity is multifaceted, consisting of diversity not only in topics, reference disciplines, and research methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, but also in level of analysis and research approach. Benbasat and Weber <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> focus on reference disciplines and, in particular, the associated theories, whereas Robey <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>, quoting Laudan <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>, believes that the aims of the research, the theories used, and the research methods employed are interdependent. More often than not, however, discussions of diversity do not distinguish the types of diversity under examination.</p><p>Distinguishing among the different characteristics of diversity is important because our analyses show that diversity varies substantially depending on the characteristic Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015 under examination. For example, the characteristics that are most diverse in the journals examined from 1995 to 1999 are reference discipline, organizational topic, research method, and level of analysis, ranging from diversity statistics of 7.35 to 8.23. Research approach, on the other hand, is much less diverse at 15.02 (a factor of 2:1), whereas topic is least diverse at 22.83 (a factor of 3:1). Note that the lack of diversity in topic is due to the fact that the preponderance of IS research is focused on organizational issues. We addressed this potential bias by examining the diversity in organizational topics.</p><p>From the viewpoint of topics, IS research is clearly focused on organizational issues (65.6 percent). Therefore, compared with topics in the computing field in general, IS is not particularly diverse. Note, however, that there is considerable diversity within the organizational topics themselves. Again, this could be due to the journals examined. However, because those journals are considered the preferred outlets for publishing IS research (especially for tenure and promotion purposes in North America), barring a change in editorial policies by journal editors, it is likely that IS as a field will remain relatively focused from the perspective of topics.</p><p>Similarly, the research approaches used in the articles examined were not particularly diverse. Research conducted using positivist approaches still dominates IS research (46.7 percent). During the 1990s, authors such as Orlikowski and Baroudi <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref> and Walsham <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref> sought to motivate interpretive (and critical) approaches to IS research. In this research, interpretive studies accounted for 4.7 percent of the studies examined, compared with 3.2 percent in Orlikowski and Baroudi's study. As we have seen under limitations, Benbasat <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> believes that the number of interpretive studies published is lower than might otherwise have been the case due to the quality of the submitted papers. Clearly, this type of research is new to many of us and it will take time to gain the experience necessary to produce high quality articles.</p><p>From the viewpoint of reference disciplines, Benbasat and Weber <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> argue that the first International Conference on Information Systems did a disservice to the field by introducing the notion of using reference disciplines in IS research. We believe that reference disciplines would have been used as an initial basis for IS research regardless of presentations at that time not only because of the prior educational foundations of those IS researchers but also because IS is an applied discipline much like engineering. Hence, we believe that the initial use of existing theories from reference disciplines was inevitable and that a unified paradigm of IS would not have been possible even with a different beginning.</p><p>What is crucial is that IS researchers use the theories derived in those reference disciplines to develop their own theories to provide the IS field with new understanding (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref>). Our study shows, in fact, that a substantial volume of IS research used IS itself as the reference discipline <ref type="bibr">(27 percent)</ref>. This is clearly a step in the correct direction if one were to accept the arguments put forth by Benbasat and Weber <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Farhoomand and Drury <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> that a moratorium on theoretical diversity is necessary for IS to progress as a discipline. However, from the viewpoint of a theoretical base, and therefore of the development of a paradigm in IS (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>), our data lead us to the conclusion that IS research does not demonstrate reliance on a single theory, or a set of theories, even in what we may regard as well-defined subareas of Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015 the discipline. This notion is supported in a recent paper by Barkhi and Sheetz <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which reports that during the years 1994 to 1998 IS researchers cited 30 theories multiple times in JMIS and MISQ and referenced a further 81 theories just once.</p><p>Our analyses and the arguments above suggest that the field may be too broad and too diverse to develop a unified focus. Further, we believe that, even if it were possible to define and operationalize Benbasat and Weber's <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> notions of "controlled diversity," it would not be beneficial for the field. After all, actively seeking to direct the field is what Benbasat and Weber believe set the discipline on the wrong track with its reliance on reference disciplines. So why would we risk forcing a direction that may not be the correct one? Hence, not only would setting direction from the top be very difficult to achieve due to the need to develop consensus among many of the top IS researchers, the approach would also be fraught with danger. Disciplines evolve, which suggests that they develop bottom-up, rather than top-down.</p><p>Implications for IS Journals. As noted earlier, it is clear that, whereas a number of dedicated IS journals such as ISR and JMIS are representative of the IS discipline, other dedicated journals are beginning to specialize. Surprisingly, for example, the IS papers published in what is regarded as a niche journal, MS, are more representative of the field than those published in MISQ, a journal originally positioned to be representative of the emerging discipline of IS. Doubtless, editorial policies in place during the 1990s played a significant role in determining the nature of the articles published from 1995 to 1999. The diversity characteristics for ISR, JMIS, and MS suggest that the editors of those journals may not have sought to steer the field in certain directions. For example, JMIS has a particularly inclusive editorial policy, which has led to the diversity that we see today in the journal. The diversity results for MISQ, on the other hand, appear to indicate that efforts by senior editors of MISQ to delineate their vision of the IS discipline, and therefore their publication preferences, in numerous policy statements, have borne fruit. For example, an editorial statement in MISQ in June 1997, "MIS Quarterly expects manuscripts to enhance our collective understanding of how best to manage or use information technologies" <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref>, encouraged researchers to focus their attention on the management and use of IT, a thrust that is consistent with the findings for MISQ in this study.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that the top IS journals examined here published little research on topics such as systems analysis and design, database management, and networking, during the period of study. Note that these topics are the heart of the IS discipline in that they are central to IS curricula and therefore to IS careers. Topics related to systems were the most represented at 7.4 percent, with topics related to data at 3.1 percent. Note that even the two most diverse journals within our field, ISR and JMIS, published only 8.6 percent and 9.4 percent of their articles on system-related topics and 1.9 percent and 4.7 percent on data-related topics, respectively. In contrast, papers on organizational topics exceeded 60 percent in all journals.</p><p>Further, note that MS, one of the nondedicated IS journals examined, published a higher percentage of articles on systems topics (8.6 percent) than the journals as a Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015 whole. MS also published more research on data topics, 6.9 percent, compared with 3.1 percent overall. These observations have potentially profound ramifications for the core of our discipline: if IS itself does not view technical research, and therefore knowledge, as important, it seems likely that other disciplines may be ready to fill the gap. It is a short step from there to issues such as which discipline is best suited to teaching this material, an issue that should be of considerable concern to all IS academics. Given this information, perhaps the IS discipline should seriously consider establishing a dedicated technical journal <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for IS Researchers</head><p>Because our research summarizes the scope and focus of the IS field, it also has significant implications for IS researchers. We suspect that, although the findings of this study on diversity in IS research might be particularly relevant to doctoral students and junior faculty, certain of our findings might surprise even some seasoned members of the IS community.</p><p>The type of characterization of the field that has emerged in this paper could be of considerable help to IS researchers in positioning their research, not only from the viewpoint of topic, but also with regard to sources of appropriate theories, choice of research approach and research method, as well as the level of analysis at which a study might be most appropriately conducted. Different researchers could be expected to use the findings for different purposes and in different ways, given their backgrounds, interests, and skills. They might wish to identify, for example, major foci or areas where little research has been published, which might therefore represent an opportunity for their own research. 7  Researchers could also use our findings to target article submissions toward particular journals where the chances of acceptance are higher; in particular, that means targeting articles toward journals that have demonstrated willingness to publish articles using similar reference disciplines or similar research approaches and methods. For example, one could argue based on our findings that an article using economics as its reference discipline might be best targeted at MS. One could also argue that an article that formulates a model might be best targeted toward journals such as MS and ISR, which published significant proportions of such papers in the time frame examined, as opposed to MISQ and DS, which published very little. Similarly, papers that use mathematical modeling might be best targeted at MS, followed by ISR and then JMIS, but not MISQ.</p><p>From the perspective of doctoral education, the results clearly demonstrate the need for students to be exposed to field studies and experimental methods. In addition, the distribution of the reference disciplines suggests that students should have solid foundations in the IS literature, as well as in core theories from the social and behavioral sciences, management, and cognitive psychology literatures. An often-overlooked aspect of doctoral programs is exposure to research conducted at various levels of analysis. It is clear from our data that students should, at a minimum, be familiar with research conducted at the organizational, individual, and group levels of analysis. Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015</p><p>Finally, we encourage researchers in the future to use our classification system not only to select key words but also to write abstracts. Such a practice would aid researchers to assess the relevance of published research to their own endeavors. For example, the current paper would be classified as follows: (1) the topic is computing research (9.1); (2) the research approach is EO (evaluative-other) since our paper is about evaluating IS research; (3) the research method is LR (literature review/analysis), which is a part of our aggregated category of data analysis; (4) the level of analysis is the profession (PRO); and (5) the reference discipline is not applicable since we did not use concepts from a specific discipline in performing the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>THE IS FIELD EXPERIENCES CONTINUAL CHANGE due to the introduction of new ITs that have significant implications for so many aspects of work life and society in general. These changes in technologies result in new knowledge, and are, in many ways, a characteristic of our field and the times in which we live. So, therefore, is diversity.</p><p>Note, however, that although IS and IT will continue to change over time, we, as IS researchers, must seek to build a cumulative research tradition. There is a tendency for IS researchers to treat new technologies as virgin or greenfield, thereby acting on the belief that prior theories or models are not appropriate. In doing that, however, we are "throwing the baby out with the bathwater," contributing in no small way to a feeling of transitoriness and lack of contribution of research in the IS discipline.</p><p>As an illustration, many IS researchers are now advising their doctoral students that the "opportunity" for them to study enterprise resource planning systems has passed. However, there is recent, significant evidence regarding the importance of integrating systems and processes to practice in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>, and to e-business systems in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Although the surface trappings may differ, it is clear that the underlying concept of cross-functionally integrated systems to support business needs will remain with us for a long time. We, as IS researchers, must focus, therefore, not on the technological trappings, but on the substantive underlying characteristics of IS and IT, which we must then represent in theory.</p><p>Acknowledging the work of Orlikowski and Iacono [65], Benbasat <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> suggests that different conceptualizations of technology could be responsible for the diversity in IS research. Note that this problem has been exacerbated in the Web-focused era, with many researchers purportedly in the IS community conducting research in which IT does not play any role (for example, topics such as "impulse buying on the Internet" and "modeling on-line consumer behavior" that do not address IS).</p><p>Ultimately, then, IS research will progress only by developing fundamental theories that endure. We need to be able, therefore, to reflect, build on, refine, and redefine our core theories in the light of new knowledge, and more specifically, new knowledge related to new IS and IT. From the viewpoint of the debate on IS research diversity, we believe that change can only be motivated by structural changes within the IS Downloaded by [Gazi University] at 14:07 23 October 2015 field and perhaps by forces outside the discipline itself. As time goes by, we believe that it is inevitable that the IS field will specialize due to the need to handle an everincreasing volume and complexity of knowledge. This process has particularly important implications for the journals of our field. We believe that any field needs certain journals that are representative of the field as a whole, as well as journals that serve specific constituencies. Moreover, we believe that the field should acknowledge not only those journals typically rated as being the top journals of our field, such as those examined in this study, but also journals that focus on areas such as system development, human-computer interaction, and so on. What is needed is a portfolio of journals that represents the field in its entirety and that can serve as guides not only to prospective authors but also to promotion and tenure committees. NOTES 1. Interestingly, Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>, in his Inaugural Editor's Comments in MIS Quarterly, reported that an objective of the MIS Quarterly is "to establish our academic field as a 'reference discipline' for other academic fields."</p><p>2. By research approach, we mean the epistemological foundations on which the study is based. According to the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, epistemology is "the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge, its presuppositions and foundations, and its extent and validity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>3. We did this because the entries in certain of the aggregated categories were very low and we did not wish to risk biasing the overall diversity and representativeness findings (see the next section).</p><p>4. Our findings regarding the "size" of IS as a reference discipline in current IS research may be driven by just a few research areas. Research involving the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> and collaborative technologies dominated IS research in this time period (see the subsection "Findings for Topic"). Because the majority of these papers cited only prior IS research and not the foundational works from the social and behavioral sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, we coded the reference discipline as IS. Hence, the use of IS as a reference discipline in IS research is not necessarily as widespread as the findings might suggest at first glance.</p><p>5. Note that in a recent editorial column in ISR, the editor, Izak Benbasat, cited our research as finding that JMIS was the most diverse of the journals studied, with ISR a close second, the reverse being true for representativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Note that the differences in reported findings lies in the treatment of the minor categories in research method: the results cited by Benbasat are those obtained with the categories treated as distinct entities rather being aggregated based on conceptual similarity (see the subsection "Classifying Research Method").</p><p>6. Recall the proviso in the subsection "Findings for Reference Discipline" (note 4), regarding the fact that this finding may be driven by one or two topic areas.</p><p>7. Note, however, that the researcher must temper this suggestion with reasoned thought; for example, it would not make sense to try to do research study in computing (topic) in the profession (level of analysis) using a descriptive system approach with a grounded theory method that uses management science as the reference discipline.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Journals are listed from most to least diverse and most to least representative; ties are recorded in alphabetical order; b overall analyses exclude organizational topic; c overall rank (determined by sum of ranks); d sum of ranks.</figDesc></figure>
