<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Ad hoc wireless networks have received widespread attention in recent years. Unlike wired networks or cellular networks, ad hoc wireless networks have no fixed networking infrastructure. As indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, an ad hoc wireless network consists of multiple nodes that maintain network connectivity through wireless communications. This connectivity is enabled via radio transmissions generated by a set of cooperating nodes. Ad hoc wireless networks have applications in areas where it is not economically practical or physically possible to provide a wired networking infrastructure. For example, in a battlefield situation it is not possible to install a conventional network in hostile territory. In such a situation an ad hoc wireless network offers a promising solution.</p><p>An ad hoc wireless network can be modeled as a graph in which each vertex represents a communication node, and each link indicates that the corresponding vertices can communicate with each other directly. A number of factors affect the communication link between two nodes. In general, for a receiver to directly and reliably receive packets from a sender, the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) at the receiver must exceed a specific threshold. Given that this article focuses on how to make the routing task energy-efficient instead of link reliability, the basic model shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is sufficient. This network topology can change dynamically for the following reasons: • A node can move.</p><p>• A node can adjust its transmission power.</p><p>• A node can turn its transceiver on or off.</p><p>The dynamic nature of ad hoc wireless networks presents new challenges to traditional networking operations in general and routing in particular. In an ad hoc wireless network, two nodes communicate either directly or indirectly through other nodes. These nodes are typically powered by batteries with limited energy supply. When a node exhausts its available energy, it ceases to function. This shutdown may potentially result in partitioning of the entire network. Therefore, an important issue in ad hoc wireless networks is how to conserve energy. Energy conservation further adds to the challenges of routing in ad hoc wireless networks.</p><p>Developing power-aware routing protocols for ad hoc wireless networks has been an extensive research area in recent years, and many protocols have been proposed from a variety of perspectives. This article surveys and classifies existing power-aware routing protocols in ad hoc wireless networks. The rest of the article is organized as follows. A discussion of the issues related to power-aware routing protocols and a classification of power-aware routing protocols are provided. The protocols in each of these classifications are introduced. Finally, we include a summary of the article and identify future research directions in the field.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABSTRACT</head><p>An ad hoc wireless network has no fixed networking infrastructure. It consists of multiple, possibly mobile, nodes that maintain network connectivity through wireless communications. Such a network has practical applications in areas where it may not be economically practical or physically possible to provide a conventional networking infrastructure. The nodes in an ad hoc wireless network are typically powered by batteries with a limited energy supply. One of the most important and challenging issues in ad hoc wireless networks is how to conserve energy, maximizing the lifetime of its nodes and thus of the network itself. Since routing is an essential function in these networks, developing poweraware routing protocols for ad hoc wireless networks has been an intensive research area in recent years. As a result, many power-aware routing protocols have been proposed from a variety of perspectives. This article surveys the current state of power-aware routing protocols in ad hoc wireless networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POWER-AWARE ROUTING PROTOCOLS IN AD HOC WIRELESS NETWORKS</head><p>computing or communication technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Therefore, reducing power consumption is an important issue in ad hoc wireless networks.</p><p>Power consumption at a node can be decomposed into communication-related and computation-related consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This article focuses on communication-related power consumption.</p><p>Traditional routing protocols tend to use shortest path algorithms (minimum hop count) without any consideration of energy consumption, often resulting in rapid energy exhaustion for the small subset of nodes in the network that experience heavy traffic loads. A power-aware routing protocol addresses the issues associated with energy consumption and conservation.</p><p>The individual node's radio transceiver, used to communicate with other nodes in the ad hoc wireless network, can be in one of four possible modes: transmit, receive, idle, and sleep. A radio transceiver consumes the least amount of power if it is in sleep mode. During transmission, to maintain an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, the power consumed by the transmitter depends on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. If a radio transmitter can dynamically adjust its transmission power either continuously or by using discrete power levels, it becomes more energy-efficient by adjusting the transmitter power so that the resulting signal is just strong enough to reach its intended destination. In wireless networks it is often more energy-efficient to send a message through a relay (two short hops) than directly (one long hop) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A power-aware routing protocol takes advantage of those properties to reduce energy consumption.</p><p>In recent years a number of power-aware routing protocols have been proposed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> the authors outline the key concepts of several proposed solutions and provide an analysis of them. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposes five power-aware metrics that can be used to classify routing protocols. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> the authors briefly review landmark papers for each protocol layer and define several metrics for studying power-aware routing protocols. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> addresses design challenges of energy-efficient protocols in various layers and places special emphasis on cross-layer design of these protocols. Our article builds on these papers by extensively reviewing a number of recent papers and classifying known poweraware routing protocols into the five categories shown below, some of which were mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>We broadly divide power-aware routing protocols into two classifications: activity-based and connectivity-based protocols. Activity-based protocols address the issue of power consumption as it relates to network activity, i.e. the actual transmission of data between nodes in the network. These protocols focus on making intelligent, power-aware routing decisions that govern the actual transmission of data. We further divide activity-based protocols into two classifications based on different routing tasks: unicasting and multicasting/broadcasting. Within the unicasting context we note that existing protocols focus on two separate issues: maximal energy saving during delivery of a single packet (also known as active energy saving) and maximizing overall network lifetime. Active energy saving protocols focus on minimizing the total consumed power per packet. Their main goal is to choose a routing path for the delivery of an individual packet that consumes the minimal amount of energy. For protocols that maximize overall network lifetime, the main focus is to distribute the energy consumption among all nodes in a balanced manner. If the route with the maximal energy saving is always chosen for delivery, the subset of nodes along this route will be overutilized and therefore drained in a short period of time, which may lead to network partitioning. Finally, power-efficient multicasting/broadcasting protocols deal with power efficiency when a single message is sent to multiple destinations.</p><p>With the goal of reducing power consumption while ensuring effective connectivity for the overall network, connectivity-based protocols look beyond issues of transmission. Maintaining effective connectivity for a wireless network is essential to almost any operation. If the connectivity of a wireless network is too dense, it causes frequent interference among nodes. If the connectivity is too sparse, the network is sensitive to node or link failure. We divide connectivitybased protocols into two categories: topology control and passive energy saving. Topology control protocols adjust nodes' transmitting power to save energy while maintaining effective network connectivity. Passive energy saving protocols save energy by simply turning off some idle nodes, since energy consumption when a node's radio is idle is not negligible. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACTIVE ENERGY SAVING PROTOCOLS</head><p>We classify those routing protocols whose main goal is finding a routing path with minimum energy consumption as active energy saving protocols. The intention is expressed precisely by one of the metrics proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>: minimize the energy consumed per packet. Assume that a packet travels through nodes n 1 n 2 … n k where n 1 is the source and n k is the destination, and T (a, b) represents the power usage for transmitting the packet from node a to node b. Then the energy consumed in the routing is</p><p>The goal is to minimize the value of e for every packet transmitted.</p><p>There are two frequently used power consumption models, referred to as the RM model and HCB model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. (Here RM and HCB are the last name initials of the authors who popularized the respective models.) The models can be generalized to u(d) = ad α + c, where u(d) represents the power required for transmission across a distance of d, α is the path loss exponent, and both a and c are constants. In the RM model, α = 4, while α = 2 in the HCB model. Both models indicate that communication between two nodes tends to consume less energy if intermediate nodes can be used for forwarding. Therefore, one technique of active energy saving protocols is to reduce power consumption by utilizing intermediate nodes to forward a packet instead of sending directly between nodes over large distances. For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure">3 T(a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>) + T(b, c) &lt; T(a, c) and T(c, d) + T(d, e) &lt; T(c, e). The Power-Aware Routing Optimization protocol (PARO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> reduces transmission power by taking advantage of immediate forwarding (i.e., using intermediate nodes as redirectors to forward a packet) rather than using a stronger signal that would transmit the packet directly to its destination. When a node determines its participation could reduce the power consumption for a transmission, the node becomes a redirector and sends a route-redirect message to the source and destination nodes, notifying them of the existence of a more powerefficient route.</p><p>In principle, once energy consumption costs for links are defined, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be applied to find the route with the minimal energy consumption. However, the nodes in an ad hoc network can be mobile. Given this, the algorithm may never converge if the nodes are highly mobile. To address this issue, several greedy strategies have been proposed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Stojmenovic and Lin proposed a localized greedy strategy that focuses directly on minimizing the energy needed to route a message from its source to its destination. It is assumed that each node knows its own location, and the sender knows the location of the destination. The power required for the transmission and reception of a packet across a distance d is assumed to be u(d) = ad α + c. They first show a theorem that if d ≤ (c/a(1 -2 1-α ))) 1/α , the power needed for direct transmission is optimal. If this is not the case, optimal transmission occurs through d(a(α -1)/c) 1/α -1 equally spaced intermediate nodes and has a minimal energy expenditure of v(d) = dc(a(α -1)/c) 1/α + da(a(α -1)/c) (1-α)/α . Note that this optimal transmission power is achievable only if these equally spaced intermediate nodes exist between the source and destination. Using this theorem, they propose a localized greedy algorithm. When transmitting a message, each originating node B (either the source node or one of the intermediate nodes) will always select a neighbor that minimizes the total power needed for the transmission from B to destination D, which is approximated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P(B, D) = u(r) + v(s) = ar α + c + sc(a(α -1)/c) 1/α + sa(a(a(α -1)/c) (1-α)/α .</formula><p>Here r is the distance between B and the selected neighbor, and s is the distance from the selected neighbor to destination D. Since the route between the selected neighbor and the destination is unknown, its energy cost is approximated by v(s) which is the minimal energy expenditure over a distance s as derived in the theorem.</p><p>The Location-Aided Power-Aware Routing protocol (LAPAR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is another localized greedy algorithm that uses relay regions. The concept of a relay region was first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to reduce energy consumption in routing. The relay region R (s,r) of source node s and relay node r is defined as the set of destination node locations where relaying through node r is more power-efficient than directly sending from node s. Therefore, if a node is within the relay region of R (s,r) , less communication power is consumed by relaying from s through r to the destination   Reliability is addressed in some active poweraware routing protocols. For example, the goal of the minimum power routing protocol (MPR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is to route a packet along a path with minimum power consumption while also ensuring reliable communication with a high packet success rate. MPR accomplishes this goal by requiring each node to alter its transmission power so that it uses just enough power to maintain an acceptable SNR at the receiver. The transmission power from node i to node j, P T ij , is determined by where ε is the desired bit-energy-to-noise-density ratio at node j, S ij is the dynamic link scale factor reflecting the current channel characteristics and interference on link ij, r ij is the distance between i and j, and η is the path loss exponent. Link error rates are taken into consideration by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> when calculating potential transmission costs for reliable message delivery. Two different error recovery models are discussed: end-to-end retransmission (EER) and hop-by-hop retransmission (HHR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAXIMIZING NETWORK LIFETIME PROTOCOLS</head><p>The primary focus of maximizing network lifetime protocols is to consume node energy in a more balanced manner. One drawback associated with active power-aware routing protocols is the overuse of a small subset of nodes. Given their goal of minimizing energy consumption, which nodes are used to minimize this consumption is not an issue. The batteries of those nodes may be drained in a short period of time, leading to potential network partition. For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, since it requires less power for C to send a packet to B via A than to send the packet to B directly, A is overused. Once A's energy is depleted, the network is partitioned. In order to use node energy in a more balanced manner, traffic should be routed through nodes that have sufficient remaining energy, as opposed to selecting routes simply based on energy consumed. However, these two goals are highly related. If energy consumption is not considered, a route consuming more energy may be selected, which consumes more of the overall network's energy and may also lead to a short network life. At the end of this section we discuss several hybrid metrics and protocols that combine both goals, maximizing network lifetime and minimizing energy consumption.</p><p>To consume node energy in a more balanced manner, an intuitive technique is to utilize a cost function based on the node's remaining battery capacity (i.e., the energy left in the battery). In Minimal Battery Cost Routing (MBCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> the battery cost R j for route j with D j nodes is defined as where and c i t is the remaining battery capacity of node i at time t. The goal is to select a route that has the minimal battery cost. In Maximum Survivability Routing (MSR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> the cost of a route R is based on the remaining battery life. Specifically, where u i is the utility rate of node i in route R. This is a decreasing function of T i , where T i is an estimate of remaining battery life. T i is equal to the node's remaining power divided by a power draining rate, which is considered to be a better measure than the remaining power alone.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> it is noted that when the summation of the battery cost functions is used, a route utilizing a node with little remaining battery capacity can still be selected if the other nodes along the route have large remaining capacity. To address this issue, the author proposes Min-Max Battery Cost Routing (MMBCR), in which the battery cost for route j is Some researchers note that considering only a battery's remaining capacity is not enough. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> the battery's drain rate is also taken into consideration. A node's drain rate is the rate at which energy is dissipated at the node. A cost function based on drain rate for node n i is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">j R f c j i route j i i t , m a x ( ) . _ = ∈ C f u i R u T R i i i R i i R = ∈ =       =   ∈ ∈ ∑ ∑ ( , ) ( / ) / β β β 1 1      1/ , β f c c i i t i t ( ) = 1 R f c j i i t i D j = = - ∑ ( ), 0 1 P S r T ij ij ij = - ε η ,</formula><p>n Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Network partition due to overuse of a small set of nodes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C B E F A D</formula><p>where DR i is the drain rate and RBP i the residual battery power. If a node is used to route heavy traffic loads simply because it has more residual power, the drain rate for that node will grow. To alleviate this problem, each node computes its drain rate based on changes in its energy level and adjusts its cost accordingly. The lifetime L P of a routing path P equals the minimum value of C i over the entire path. When considering all possible paths from a source to a destination, the minimum drain rate (MDR) mechanism will select the one with the highest lifetime value.</p><p>Simulation results show that MDR can achieve the goal of prolonging the lifetime of both nodes and connections. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> propose three poweraware metrics for ad hoc wireless network routing protocols. Their goal is to maximize the amount of information transmitted per energy unit while also balancing energy usage among all network nodes. If a link (i, j) is associated with a cost denoted D i,j , the cost of a routing path p is given as C p = Σ (i,j)∈p D ij . The first link cost function is defined as D ij = P ij , where P ij is the power required for transmission from node i to node j. Since this metric always uses the path with minimum power consumption, some paths may receive more use, causing unbalanced energy consumption among the nodes. A second metric is defined to address this problem, where R i and R j represent the residual energy of node i and j, respectively. A third metric, based on the observation that it is sometimes preferable to select a path consisting of nodes with more residual energy even though it may consume additional energy, is defined as Here P max is the maximum transmission power level, and E j o and E j r represents the initial energy level and residual energy level of node j, respectively. W p and W e are weights that can be adjusted to favor either of the two terms.</p><p>The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> present a Power-Aware Source Routing (PSR) protocol derived from Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. PSR extends the network's lifetime by balancing node usage. Like DSR, a source node first floods the network with a routing request (RREQ) for route discovery. Intermediate nodes only forward the first RREQ they receive. As it forwards the RREQ, an intermediate node calculates its cost and adds it to the path cost in the header of the RREQ packet. The destination receives multiple possible paths for the transmission and is responsible for comparing path costs and selecting a minimum cost path. In PSR the cost function for a path π at route discovery time t, denoted C(π, t), is defined as In this equation ρ i represents the transmission power required for node i located along path π; F i is the battery capacity of node i; R i (t) is the remaining battery level at time t; and α is a positive weighting factor. As the equation shows, PSR considers the node's energy level during route discovery. When the energy of a node R i (t) is low, the cost C i (t) for routing a message through that node tends to be high. Network load is balanced by avoiding routes through low-energy nodes.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes different metrics and their stresses for power-aware routing. Several of the metrics presented address both goals: maximizing the lifetime of wireless networks and minimizing power consumption for message delivery. The definition of each symbol can be found in the preceding paragraphs that describe the individual protocols.</p><p>Realizing that the goals of maximizing network lifetime and minimizing power consumption might result in conflict, researchers tried to optimize one goal while bounding the other. The max-min zP min algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> finds a path that maximizes the minimal residual power of the nodes within the path under the constraint that the power consumed is at most zP min , where z ≥ 1 is a constant factor and P min is the least power consumption. To find such a path, the algorithm first finds the path with the least power consumption P min . It then removes the nodes with minimal residual power from the path. Next, the algorithm finds alternative paths with minimum power consumption that do not contain the nodes just removed. The process continues until the minimum power consumption of such a path exceeds zP min . Since the maxmin zP min algorithm requires accurate power values for all nodes in the network, it is difficult to implement on large-scale networks. Zone based routing is proposed to solve this problem, where the network is divided into geographical zones. Each zone decides how to best route messages within its zone using the max-min zP min algorithm. A global controller manages all zones, combining paths from individual zones in the overall network. To meet both goals, Toh <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposes the Conditional Max-Min Battery Capacity Routing (CMMBCR) protocol that tries to find a route with minimal power consumption under the constraint that the battery capacity of the route is not below a certain threshold. The battery capacity for a route j at time t is defined as where c i t represents the battery capacity of node i at time t. When there are routes whose battery capacity is above the threshold, a route with minimum total energy consumption is chosen from those routes. On the other hand, if the battery capacity for all routes is below the threshold, the route with the maximal battery capacity is chosen.</p><p>Chiasserini <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> claims that battery usage and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R c j t i route j i t = ∈ min , _ C t C t C t F R t i i i i i i ( , )<label>( ), ( ) ( ) π ρ π</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">= =     ∈ ∑ where    α .

For example, the goal of the minimum power routing protocol (MPR) is to route a packet along a path with minimum power consumption while also ensuring reliable communication with a high packet success rate.</p><p>management can also affect the lifetime of a battery. The author proposed the Battery Energy Efficient (BEE) protocol based on three observations:</p><p>• Pulsed current discharge outperforms constant current discharge (the recovery effect). • Battery capacity can be improved by using a bursty discharge pattern since the charge recovery effect can take place during idle periods. • For a certain value of current drawn off the battery, higher current impulses degrade battery performance, even if the percentage of higher current impulses is relatively small (the rate capacity effect). Therefore, battery status b i can be updated as follows:</p><p>where λ i is the transmission rate, e - i is the mean energy necessary for node i to transmit a packet to the neighbor nodes, and Γ is the energy increase function based on the recovery effect. In the same equation e ij represents the energy spent for transmission from node i to node j, e min is the minimum transmission energy required to reach a neighbor, and Φ is the function that reflects the rate capacity effect. The cost function for route r is defined as where Ψ is a weighting function that emphasizes energy loss and p ij is the energy penalty due to the rate capacity effect experienced at node i. In the proposed BEE protocol, the time is divided into discrete intervals corresponding to the packet transmission time. During each time interval, each node updates its battery status b i as described above. When a source node has data to send, it evaluates the costs of all possible routes and then selects the route with the minimum cost. Simulation results show that BEE significantly outperforms Minimum Transmission Energy (MTE, i.e., the protocol minimizing the energy consumed per packet) in terms of both network lifetime and packet delay.</p></div>

A number of protocols have been proposed that reduce energy consumption in ad hoc wireless networks by turning off idle radios. We refer to those protocols as passive energy saving protocols. The general goal of the protocols in this category is to turn off as many radios as possible while still maintaining the necessary network connectivity. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows a network divided into virtual hexagonal cells.

Some protocols use a distributed technique whereby each node decides its schedule on its own. Others manage individual node schedules in a more integrated manner, using a designated set of backbone nodes that serve as coordinators to determine their subject nodes' schedules. Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed two distributed coordination routing algorithms to manage nodes' radios: the Basic Energy-Conserving Algorithm (BECA) and the Adaptive Fidelity Energy-Conserving Algorithm (AFECA). The basic idea of BECA is for nodes to turn their radio off when they are not participating in the sending, forwarding, or receiving of data. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, BECA defines three possible states for a node in terms of its radio: sleeping, listening, and active. Initially, a node is assumed to be in the sleeping state where its radio is off. It stays in its sleeping state for a period of time T s . While the radio is in the sleeping state, if the node has data to send, it wakes up and transitions directly into the active state. Otherwise, the node turns its radio on and transits into the listening state after time T s . A radio stays in the listening state for a maximum time period of T l . Whenever it has data to send, receive, or forward, it changes into the active state. If no activity occurs after listening for time T l , it changes back to the sleeping state. While in the active state, a node may send, receive, or forward data. If it does not have activity for a time period of T a , it transits into the sleeping state. If a node attempts to send a message to another node that is in the sleeping state, the sender will resend the message periodically until the destination node wakes up and receives the message. AFECA builds on BECA, going one step further by adjusting the sleeping time of a node based on node density. Both algorithms work on top of existing on-demand ad hoc routing protocols, and simulation results show that these techniques consume as little as 50 percent of the energy of an unmodified ad hoc routing algorithm.</p><p>Span <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is another power-saving algorithm designed to reduce energy consumption without sacrificing network connectivity. Each node in the network runs the Span process, which is responsible for making independent decisions on whether the node should become a coordinator node or go to sleep. The decision is based on the node's available energy and the potential benefit realized by its neighbors. When two neighbors of a node cannot reach each other directly or via one or two coordinators, the node becomes a coordinator. Coordinators are responsible for routing messages in the network while the other nodes are in sleep mode. A coordinator node periodically checks if it should withdraw as a coordinator. It withdraws its coordinator identity when each pair of its neighbors can reach each other directly or via other coordinators. A sleeping node wakes up periodically to decide whether it should become a coordinator. Simulation results indicate that Span provides significant energy saving while preserving both network connectivity and capacity.</p><p>The Geographical Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> uses geographical information to prolong the sleeping time of a node. In GAF the ad hoc network is divided into "virtual grids." The grids are structured such that any two nodes within neighboring grids can communicate with each other. Each grid must keep enough nodes active to ensure overall network connectivity, placing other nodes within its grid into a sleeping state to reduce energy consumption. Tseng and Hsieh's protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> also partitions an ad hoc network into grids. In their model the grid shape can be either square or hexagonal (which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and like PCS networks). Each grid identifies a leader based on energy concerns. Only the leader is required to stay awake, routing messages and buffering packets for the sleeping nodes in its grid; the other nodes that are not actively sending or receiving packets go into sleep mode. There are three states defined for a node in this algorithm: leader, competing, and slave. Whenever a node is unaware of the existence of a leader in its grid, it enters the competing state. It broadcasts its intention to become a leader within the grid. If no leader is </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leader node</head><p>Turned-off node present and no other nodes are in competing mode, this node becomes the leader. When two or more nodes enter the competing state, the node with the highest energy level becomes the leader, and the others enter slave mode. A leader broadcasts hello messages periodically to announce its leadership. Likewise, slave nodes wake up periodically to register their identity to the grid leader. A leader may retire due to low energy level or movement out of its local grid. During route discovery, the source node first sends a route request to its grid leader, and then the grid leader broadcasts the request to its neighboring grid leaders. This process continues until the leader of the grid that contains the destination node is reached. Finally, the grid leader delivers the transmission request to the destination node.</p><p>A set of backbone nodes is used to coordinate sleeping schedules in the Coordination Power Conservation (CPC) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. A backbone node (CPC server) is responsible for scheduling its local non-backbone nodes' (CPC clients') sleeping times to conserve power in the wireless network. The backbone construction of CPC is a modified form of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. A CPC client starts in an active state. When a CPC client has no current communication activity, it sends a sleep request to its CPC server. The CPC server decides whether to authorize the sleeping request and, if permitted, the sleep interval. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> summarizes various passive energy saving protocols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TOPOLOGY CONTROL PROTOCOLS</head><p>The topology of an ad hoc wireless network is defined by the set of wireless communication links that exist between the network's nodes. As a node's transmission power is adjusted, the network topology changes accordingly. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> illustrates network topology changes as the nodes in the network increase their transmission power. When using a lower transmission power, nodes A, B, C, and D form a ring as shown in the top half of the figure. The bottom half illustrates how, when all four nodes increase their transmission power, the network topology changes and a complete graph is formed. Studies have shown that the topology should not be too sparse (i.e., low node transmission power) or too dense (i.e., high node transmission power). Several protocols have been proposed that minimize network energy consumption while maintaining a desired network topology. Some protocols maintain the network topology based on the degree of each node in the network, while others identify a less dense network topology that contains the minimum energy topology, to be defined later.</p><p>The network topology is formed by the links of each node in the network. In a wireless network, the number of links a node has is mainly determined by its transmission power. By managing its transmission power wisely, a node is able to not only maintain all necessary links, but also to reduce its power consumption. Controlling the topology of a wireless network by using adjustments to transmission power is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In a static network, the algorithm builds connected and biconnected networks using a greedy strategy, similar to the construction of a minimum spanning tree. It starts with each node forming a connected component of its own. If two nodes are not in the same component, each node uses just enough power to reach the other node so two components can be merged into one. The algorithm terminates when there is only one component. A post-processing step ensures that the transmission power per-node is minimal. For a mobile network, two distributed algorithms are introduced, Local Information No Topology (LINT) and Local Information Link-State Topology (LILT). In LINT, each node maintains a high (d h ) and low (d l ) threshold on the number of its neighbors. If the node has more than d h neighbors, it needs to reduce its transmission power. Likewise, if the node has less than d l neighbors, it increases its transmission power. Since LINT uses only local information, it is not able to recognize network partitions. LILT utilizes global link state information as well as transmission power adjustments to maintain desired network connection.</p><p>n n n n  Simulation results show that both power consumption and throughput performance can be substantially improved with topology control.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> the authors propose a distributed cone-based topology control algorithm. The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step each node u beacons with increasing transmission power. If a new neighbor node is found, the node is added to u's neighbor set. This process continues until u has at least one neighbor node in every α degree cone with its apex at u, or u reaches its maximum transmission power. When node x becomes u's neighbor, it introduces an α degree cone centered at ux, as shown by the shaded area in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>. When additional nodes are added to u's neighbor set, the shaded area grows bigger. The first step stops when the shaded area reaches 360˚ or u reaches its maximum transmission power. The second step removes redundant edges without reducing connectivity. Specifically, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>, if node u has two neighbors, v and w, such that the power needed to send from u to w directly is not less than the total power needed to send via v, w is removed from the neighbor set of u. This second step reduces node degree, helping to reduce interference and enhance throughput. The correctness of the algorithm is proved theoretically, and simulation shows significant performance improvement in network lifetime.</p><p>For a pair of nodes in the network, a minimum energy path is the path through which the least amount of energy is consumed when delivering a message from one node to the other. The minimum energy topology of a wireless network is defined as a subgraph that contains only the links located in the minimum energy path of any two nodes. Finding the minimum energy topology or a subgraph containing it is the first step toward identifying a minimum energy path between two nodes. Several protocols have been proposed that first identify a subgraph containing the minimum energy topology, and then find the minimum energy path from the subgraph. 1  Rodoplu and Meng <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed a distributed algorithm referred to as Minimum-Energy Communication Network (MECN). Their work is based on the principle that relaying may consume less total power than direct transmission. They define the relay region R(i, r) for relay node r with regard to transmission node i. If receiving node j is located within R(i, r), it is more energy-efficient to relay through r than to send from i to j directly. (Please refer to Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> for an example of the relay region.) Therefore, a transmitter does not need to consider direct transmission to any node that falls in the relay region of another node. If a node does not fall into another node's relay region, it is viewed as an immediate neighbor of the transmitter. The transmitter uses only enough power to reach its immediate neighbors. An enclosure graph is formed by connecting a node with its immediate neighbors. The enclosure graph contains the minimum power topology, which can be constructed locally. Li and Halpern <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> revisited the minimum energy topology issue and proposed a protocol called Small Minimum-Energy Communication Network (SMECN) that has lower computational complexity and produces a smaller enclosure graph than MECN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>It is useful to have a subgraph that contains the minimum energy topology. With this, the minimum energy path between two nodes can be obtained from the subgraph. However, sometimes it is difficult to obtain such a subgraph because either the subgraph itself or the algorithm to obtain the subgraph is too complex. Motivated by the length stretch factor, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> define a power stretch factor and use it to evaluate the power efficiency of different network topologies. Given a graph G with V as its node set, the power stretch factor of a subgraph H with regard to G is defined as where p H (u, v) and p G (u, v) represent the least energy consumed by all possible paths from node u to node v in graphs H and G, respectively. (It is obvious that for a subgraph containing the minimum energy topology, its power stretch factor is one.) Assuming the unit disk graph model in which two nodes are connected if and only if the distance between them is at most one, the article studies the power stretch factor for several well-known proximity graphs including the Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG), Gabriel Graph (GG), and Yao Graph (YG). These proximity graphs only maintain a linear number of links while ensuring efficient routing for any pair of nodes. In addition, these proximity graphs can be locally constructed in an efficient manner. The article shows that the power stretch factor of GG is one and the power stretch factor of YG is bounded by a constant. Realizing 1 These protocols may also be viewed as active energy saving protocols because their goal is to find a minimum energy path. They are classified as topology control protocols here because their primary contribution is using topology control to obtain a subgraph that contains the minimum energy topology. Once such a subgraph is obtained, any active energy saving protocols can be applied.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ρ H u v V H G G p u v p u v ( ) max ( , )<label>( , ) , , =</label></formula><p>a transmitter does not need to consider direct transmission to any node that falls in the relay region of another node.

The authors consider only O ∈ {MaxP, TotalP}, which represents a minimization of the maximum or total power, respectively. A property P for a network's graph is monotone if the property continues to hold when the power assigned to some nodes is increased. The authors show that if the desired property of a network's graph is not monotone, the problem of minimizing the maximum power for the network could be NP-complete. Even for graphs that possess a monotone and polynomial time testable property, the problem of minimizing the maximum power plus minimizing the number of nodes with maximum power is NPcomplete. The problem of minimizing the total power for the network tends to be computationally intractable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENERGY-EFFICIENT MULTICASTING AND BROADCASTING PROTOCOLS</head><p>Wireless ad hoc networks make extensive use of multicasting and broadcasting during communication. Given the energy constraints placed on the network's nodes, designing energy-efficient multicasting and broadcasting protocols in wireless ad hoc networks is even more challenging, and is gradually becoming an active research area. In this section we discuss multicasting and broadcasting protocols separately. A distinguishing characteristic of wireless communication, compared to wired communication, is that all nodes within a communication range of a transmitting node can receive its signal, commonly known as the wireless multicast advantage. Broadcasting and multicasting protocols that exploit this property of wireless communication are classified as node-based protocols. Protocols that consider each link between two nodes indepen-dently are classified as link-based protocols. As the right side of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BROADCASTING</head><p>Broadcasting sends a message from one node to all other nodes in the network. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>  The first phase builds an initial broadcast tree using a link-based MST algorithm. In the second phase EWMA improves this broadcasting tree. The improvement excludes some nodes from the set of transmitting nodes, yet still reaches all nodes that were previously covered. This is done by increasing the transmission power of a selected node. If the energy consumption in this new tree is less than in the original tree, the corresponding part of the MST is changed. The authors show a distributed implementation of EWMA, using the distributed algorithm proposed by <ref type="bibr">Gallager et al. in [36]</ref>, to construct a minimum-weight spanning tree as the initial solution. The simulation results show that the performance of EWMA is at least as good as BIP. Furthermore, EWMA can be implemented in a distributed manner.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> Liang proves that the minimum-energy broadcast tree problem is NP-complete and presents an approximate solution. This solution assumes that there are k adjustable power levels for each node in the wireless network. The first step constructs an auxiliary graph in which a node is linked to k virtual nodes that represent k n n n n power levels the node has, with the weight being the corresponding power level. If node a can reach node b at its ith power level, a link with weight zero is added from the ith virtual node of a to node b. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref> illustrates the auxiliary graph of node a. In the figure a link with weight zero is drawn from the second virtual node of a to node b to indicate that node a can reach node b at its second power level. The author proves that the minimum-energy broadcast tree is exactly the directed Steiner tree of the auxiliary graph, with the source node as the root and the other n -1 nodes as the terminals of the Steiner tree. (For a more complete Steiner tree definition, the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.) Using the Steiner tree, the power level for each node can be set accordingly. The authors then apply the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to construct an approximate Steiner tree in the auxiliary graph. The time complexity of the algorithm is O((k + 1) 1/ε n 3/ε ), where n is the number of nodes in the wireless network, k is the number of power levels, and ε is a constant between 0 and 1. This algorithm is also extended to solve the minimum-energy multicasting tree problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MULTICASTING</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> six preliminary energy-efficient multicasting algorithms for static ad hoc wireless networks are proposed. The first algorithm is based on an underlying unicast algorithm that provides a minimum-cost path from a source node to a destination node. The multicast tree consists of the congregation of all paths from the source to the destination nodes within the multicast request. The next three algorithms are based on pruning the broadcast tree generated by a MST algorithm. The first of these three algorithms prunes the broadcast tree generated by a linkbased MST algorithm. It does not take into consideration the wireless multicast advantage. The second of these three algorithms prunes the broadcast tree generated by a node-based MST algorithm that utilizes the wireless multicast advantage. The third of these three algorithms obtains the multicast tree by pruning a suboptimal node-based spanning tree instead of the MST. The construction of this spanning tree begins at the source node. The source's transmission power is chosen to maximize the n/p metric, where n represents the number of new destinations reached and p represents the total power required to reach those new destinations.</p><p>The algorithm chooses, among all nodes covered by the maximum power level, the one that maximizes the n/p metric. This process continues until all the nodes are covered. The fifth and sixth algorithms require an exhaustive search process. In the fifth algorithm an exhaustive search is performed for all possible multicast trees. The multicast tree with the lowest cost is chosen. The sixth algorithm is based on a local yardstick function defined as where m i represents the number of destinations reached, n i is the number of intended destinations, and p i is the sum of the transmission powers used by all nodes in the i-th multicast session. The yardstick function is classified as local because it is limited to one single session. The tree with the maximum local yardstick value is chosen for the ith multicast session. Given that an exhaustive search is involved, the complexities of the last two algorithms are high.</p><p>The Energy-Efficient Multicasting Routing Protocol (E 2 MRP) is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. It uses a graph-based, instead of tree-based, multicasting infrastructure. During the course of relaying group creation and maintenance, E 2 MRP alternatively uses two route selection metrics: minimum energy consumed per packet (MECP) and minimum maximum node cost (MMNC). The MECP cost function for a route R k = n 1 , n 2 , …, n p is defined as where P i,i+1 is the power needed for the link between node ni and node n i+1 , d(n i , n i+1 ) is the distance between n i and n i+1 , and θ is the path loss exponent. The MMNC cost for node n i represents its reluctance to relay a packet and is defined as where Ψ is a constant and V i (t) indicates the energy of node n i at time t. The MMNC cost function for route R k is defined as When a source node has multicasting data to send, it floods a MECP_RG_REQUEST in the MECP phase (or MMNC_RG_REQUEST in the MMNC Phase). The destination nodes calculate the MECP (or MMNC) costs of multiple routes, and select the route with the minimum cost as the multicasting route. The relaying group is established after the destinations send back the MECP_RG_REPLY (or MMNC_RG_REPLY). The MECP and MMNC phases are alternated based on the cost function switcher (CFS) timer.

The wireless network is divided into a set of clusters, each containing a cluster head. Initially, each node is a cluster (and cluster head). A node then increases its discrete power level one step at a time until fewer additional nodes are found than in the previous step or the power level reaches its maximum. A node joins the first cluster it hears whose ID is grater than its own. If a node is not recruited by any cluster, it eventually forms a singleton cluster, and its power level is set so that it just reaches its nearest neighbor. Cluster heads are viewed as supernodes, forming a supernode topology. Using the supernode topology, any existing wireless ad hoc network protocol can be run. Multicast data moves from the sender to its cluster head, then along the supernode topology according to the result of the chosen multicast protocol, finally propagating from destinations' cluster heads to the receivers within these clusters. This methodology was demonstrated by adapting to ODMRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Simulation results show up to 100 percent improvement in energy consumption over ODMRP without clustering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>In this article we survey a number of contemporary research papers that explore energy-aware routing protocols in wireless ad hoc networks. These power-aware routing protocols are broadly divided into five categories: active energy saving protocols, passive energy saving protocols, network lifetime maximizing protocols, topology control protocols, and energy-efficient multicasting and broadcasting protocols. Designing a good energy-efficient routing protocol for ad hoc wireless networks is a challenging task. First, the minimal power required to transmit data from one node to the next is hard to determine. There are currently two popular energy consumption models, the RM and HCB models, that approximate the required power. Neither model takes into consideration obstacles or interference that may lie between two communicating nodes. In addition, both models assume that the distance between two nodes is determinable. One way to know this distance is to ask each node to report its own location, which requires a positioning device such as a Global Positioning System receiver. The added positioning device will, of course, consume additional power. Second, all nodes in an ad hoc network may be mobile. Even if the distance between two nodes is determinable, this distance could change due to the nodes' mobility. Third, energy saving is not the only goal for routing in ad hoc wireless networks. Other routing goals may contradict energy conservation. For example, it is energy-wise to use multiple small hops instead of one big hop in a route, but such a route results in a longer end-to-end delay that is not desirable. Finally, security and quality of service requirements will further add to the challenge of designing a good energy-efficient routing protocol.</p><p>Although considerable research has been done on energy saving in ad hoc wireless networks, this field is still in its infancy. Future work can be developed in four directions. First, more localized routing algorithms should be developed that find energy-efficient routes or topologies. A localized algorithm is a distributed algorithm running on each node that makes decisions based only on information regarding its local neighbors. Most existing energy-efficient routing or topology control algorithms are global in nature. The energy consumption problem is usually modeled as an optimization problem that is generally NP-complete, even for static networks. Due to network mobility, it is impossible to know all the nodes in the network and find a solution in a timely manner. Localized algorithms show much greater potential to quickly capture an ad hoc wireless network's characteristics and provide methodologies for energy-efficient routing.</p><p>Second, error rates should be considered in the design and evaluation of energy-efficient protocols. It is well known that wireless communication is not as reliable as wired communication, yet only a few power-aware routing protocols consider the transmission error rate. Algorithms should address error rates and realistic assumptions regarding characteristics of the space between nodes, as it is not always an open space free of obstacles and interference.</p><p>Third, to maximally reduce energy consumption, energy saving should be considered in every layer of the protocol. Recently, a few research groups have started to work on cross-layer energy-aware protocols for ad hoc wireless networks. The characteristics inherent to an ad hoc wireless network should be fully exploited by each layer in the networking protocol to ensure optimal performance.</p><p>Finally, more work on the development of power-efficient multicasting or broadcasting protocols should be done, especially localized protocols. An interesting subarea is power-efficient geocasting, where a packet is delivered to all nodes within a specific geographical region. To the best of our knowledge, no research work on power-efficient geocasting has been reported in the literature to date.</p><p>Due to network mobility, it is impossible to know all the nodes in the network and find a solution in a timely manner. Localized algorithms show much greater potential to quickly capture an ad hoc wireless network's characteristics and provide methodologies for energy-efficient routing.</p></div>
