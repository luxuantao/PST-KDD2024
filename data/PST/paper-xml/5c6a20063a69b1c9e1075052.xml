<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SR-GAN) is a seminal work that is capable of generating realistic textures during single image super-resolution. However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SR-GAN -network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge (region 3) with the best perceptual index.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Single image super-resolution (SISR), as a fundamental low-level vision problem, has attracted increasing attention in the research community and AI companies. SISR aims at recovering a high-resolution (HR) image from a single low-resolution (LR) one. Since the pioneer work of SRCNN proposed by Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, deep convolution neural network (CNN) approaches have brought prosperous development. Various network architecture designs and training strategies have continuously improved the SR performance, especially the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) value <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>. However, these PSNRoriented approaches tend to output over-smoothed results without sufficient</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SRGAN ESRGAN Ground Truth</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: The super-resolution results of ×4 for SRGAN, the proposed ESRGAN and the ground-truth. ESRGAN outperforms SRGAN in sharpness and details.</p><p>high-frequency details, since the PSNR metric fundamentally disagrees with the subjective evaluation of human observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Several perceptual-driven methods have been proposed to improve the visual quality of SR results. For instance, perceptual loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref> is proposed to optimize super-resolution model in a feature space instead of pixel space. Generative adversarial network <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> is introduced to SR by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref> to encourage the network to favor solutions that look more like natural images. The semantic image prior is further incorporated to improve recovered texture details <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. One of the milestones in the way pursuing visually pleasing results is SRGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. The basic model is built with residual blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> and optimized using perceptual loss in a GAN framework. With all these techniques, SRGAN significantly improves the overall visual quality of reconstruction over PSNR-oriented methods.</p><p>However, there still exists a clear gap between SRGAN results and the ground-truth (GT) images, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In this study, we revisit the key components of SRGAN and improve the model in three aspects. First, we improve the network structure by introducing the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RDDB), which is of higher capacity and easier to train. We also remove Batch Normalization (BN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> layers as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and use residual scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> and smaller initialization to facilitate training a very deep network. Second, we improve the discriminator using Relativistic average GAN (RaGAN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, which learns to judge "whether one image is more realistic than the other" rather than "whether one image is real or fake". Our experiments show that this improvement helps the generator recover more realistic texture details. Third, we propose an improved perceptual loss by using the VGG features before activation instead of after activation as in SRGAN. We empirically find that the adjusted perceptual loss provides sharper edges and more visually pleasing results, as will be shown Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Perception-distortion plane on PIRM self validation dataset. We show the baselines of EDSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, RCAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> and EnhanceNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, and the submitted ESRGAN model. The blue dots are produced by image interpolation.</p><p>in Sec. 4.3. Extensive experiments show that the enhanced SRGAN, termed ES-RGAN, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sharpness and details (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</p><p>We take a variant of ESRGAN to participate in the PIRM-SR Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. This challenge is the first SR competition that evaluates the performance in a perceptual-quality aware manner based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. The perceptual quality is judged by the non-reference measures of Ma's score <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> and NIQE <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, i.e., perceptual index = 1 2 ((10 − Ma) + NIQE). A lower perceptual index represents a better perceptual quality.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the perception-distortion plane is divided into three regions defined by thresholds on the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), and the algorithm that achieves the lowest perceptual index in each region becomes the regional champion. We mainly focus on region 3 as we aim to bring the perceptual quality to a new high. Thanks to the aforementioned improvements and some other adjustments as discussed in Sec. 4.5, our proposed ESRGAN won the first place in the PIRM-SR Challenge (region 3) with the best perceptual index.</p><p>In order to balance the visual quality and RMSE/PSNR, we further propose the network interpolation strategy, which could continuously adjust the reconstruction style and smoothness. Another alternative is image interpolation, which directly interpolates images pixel by pixel. We employ this strategy to participate in region 1 and region 2. The network interpolation and image interpolation strategies and their differences are discussed in Sec. 3.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>We focus on deep neural network approaches to solve the SR problem. Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref> propose SRCNN to learn the mapping from LR to HR images in an end-to-end manner, achieving superior performance against previous works. Later on, the field has witnessed a variety of network architectures, such as a deeper network with residual learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, Laplacian pyramid structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, residual blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, recursive learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>, densely connected network <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, deep back projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and residual dense network <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. Specifically, Lim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> propose EDSR model by removing unnecessary BN layers in the residual block and expanding the model size. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> propose to use effective residual dense block in SR, and they further explore a deeper network with channel attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. Besides supervised learning, other methods like reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> and unsupervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> are also introduced to solve general image restoration problems.</p><p>Several methods have been proposed to stabilize training a very deep model. For instance, residual path is developed to stabilize the training and improve the performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>. Residual scaling is first employed by Szegedy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> and also used in EDSR. For general deep networks, He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> propose a robust initialization method for VGG-style networks without BN. To facilitate training a deeper network, we develop a compact and effective residual-in-residual dense block, which also helps to improve the perceptual quality.</p><p>Perceptual-driven approaches have also been proposed to improve the visual quality of SR results. Based on the idea of being closer to perceptual similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, perceptual loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> is proposed to enhance the visual quality by minimizing the error in a feature space instead of pixel space. Contextual loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> is developed to generate images with natural image statistics by using an objective that focuses on the feature distribution. Ledig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> propose SRGAN model that uses perceptual loss and adversarial loss to favor outputs residing on the manifold of natural images. Sajjadi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> develop a similar approach and further explored the local texture matching loss. Based on these works, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> propose spatial feature transform to effectively incorporate semantic prior in an image and improve the recovered textures.</p><p>Photo-realism is usually attained by adversarial training with GAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Recently there are a bunch of works that focus on developing more effective GAN frameworks. WGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> proposes to minimize a reasonable and efficient approximation of Wasserstein distance and regularizes discriminator by weight clipping. Other improved regularization for discriminator includes gradient clipping <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and spectral normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. Relativistic discriminator <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> is developed not only to increase the probability that generated data are real, but also to simultaneously decrease the probability that real data are real. In this work, we enhance SRGAN by employing a more effective relativistic average GAN.</p><p>SR algorithms are typically evaluated by several widely used distortion measures, e.g., PSNR and SSIM. However, these metrics fundamentally disagree with the subjective evaluation of human observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Non-reference measures are used for perceptual quality evaluation, including Ma's score <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> and NIQE <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, both of which are used to calculate the perceptual index in the PIRM-SR Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. In a recent study, Blau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> find that the distortion and perceptual quality are at odds with each other. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: We employ the basic architecture of SRResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, where most computation is done in the LR feature space. We could select or design "basic blocks" (e.g., residual block <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, dense block <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, RRDB) for better performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Proposed Methods</head><p>Our main aim is to improve the overall perceptual quality for SR. In this section, we first describe our proposed network architecture and then discuss the improvements from the discriminator and perceptual loss. At last, we describe the network interpolation strategy for balancing perceptual quality and PSNR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Network Architecture</head><p>In order to further improve the recovered image quality of SRGAN, we mainly make two modifications to the structure of generator G: 1) remove all BN layers; 2) replace the original basic block with the proposed Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB), which combines multi-level residual network and dense connections as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref>.  Removing BN layers has proven to increase performance and reduce computational complexity in different PSNR-oriented tasks including SR <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and deblurring <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. BN layers normalize the features using mean and variance in a batch during training and use estimated mean and variance of the whole training dataset during testing. When the statistics of training and testing datasets differ a lot, BN layers tend to introduce unpleasant artifacts and limit the generalization ability. We empirically observe that BN layers are more likely to bring artifacts when the network is deeper and trained under a GAN framework. These artifacts occasionally appear among iterations and different settings, violating the needs for a stable performance over training. We therefore remove BN layers for stable training and consistent performance. Furthermore, removing BN layers helps to improve generalization ability and to reduce computational complexity and memory usage.</p><p>We keep the high-level architecture design of SRGAN (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), and use a novel basic block namely RRDB as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref>. Based on the observation that more layers and connections could always boost performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>, the proposed RRDB employs a deeper and more complex structure than the original residual block in SRGAN. Specifically, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref>, the proposed RRDB has a residual-in-residual structure, where residual learning is used in different levels. A similar network structure is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> that also applies a multilevel residual network. However, our RRDB differs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> in that we use dense block <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> in the main path as <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, where the network capacity becomes higher benefiting from the dense connections.</p><p>In addition to the improved architecture, we also exploit several techniques to facilitate training a very deep network: 1) residual scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>, i.e., scaling down the residuals by multiplying a constant between 0 and 1 before adding them to the main path to prevent instability; 2) smaller initialization, as we empirically find residual architecture is easier to train when the initial parameter variance becomes smaller. More discussion can be found in the supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Relativistic Discriminator</head><p>Besides the improved structure of generator, we also enhance the discriminator based on the Relativistic GAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Different from the standard discriminator D in SRGAN, which estimates the probability that one input image x is real and natural, a relativistic discriminator tries to predict the probability that a real image x r is relatively more realistic than a fake one x f , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>. Specifically, we replace the standard discriminator with the Relativistic average Discriminator RaD <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, denoted as D Ra . The standard discriminator in SRGAN can be expressed as D(x) = σ(C(x)), where σ is the sigmoid function and C(x) is the non-transformed discriminator output. Then the RaD is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D Ra (x r , x f ) = σ(C(x r ) − E x f [C(x f )])</formula><p>, where E x f [•] represents the operation of taking average for all fake data in the mini-batch. The discriminator loss is then defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L Ra D = −E xr [log(D Ra (x r , x f ))] − E x f [log(1 − D Ra (x f , x r ))].<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The adversarial loss for generator is in a symmetrical form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L Ra G = −E xr [log(1 − D Ra (x r , x f ))] − E x f [log(D Ra (x f , x r ))],<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where x f = G(x i ) and x i stands for the input LR image. It is observed that the adversarial loss for generator contains both x r and x f . Therefore, our generator benefits from the gradients from both generated data and real data in adversarial training, while in SRGAN only generated part takes effect. In Sec. 4.3, we will show that this modification of discriminator helps to learn sharper edges and more detailed textures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Perceptual Loss</head><p>We also develop a more effective perceptual loss L percep by constraining on features before activation rather than after activation as practiced in SRGAN.</p><p>Based on the idea of being closer to perceptual similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, Johnson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> propose perceptual loss and it is extended in SRGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Perceptual loss is previously defined on the activation layers of a pre-trained deep network, where the distance between two activated features is minimized. Contrary to the convention, we propose to use features before the activation layers, which will overcome two drawbacks of the original design. First, the activated features are very sparse, especially after a very deep network, as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. For example, the average percentage of activated neurons for image 'baboon' after VGG19-54<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">6</ref> layer is merely 11.17%. The sparse activation provides weak supervision and thus leads to inferior performance. Second, using features after activation also causes inconsistent reconstructed brightness compared with the ground-truth image, which we will show in Sec. 4.3.</p><p>Therefore, the total loss for the generator is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L G = L percep + λL Ra G + ηL 1 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where L 1 = E xi ||G(x i ) − y|| 1 is the content loss that evaluate the 1-norm distance between recovered image G(x i ) and the ground-truth y, and λ, η are the coefficients to balance different loss terms. We also explore a variant of perceptual loss in the PIRM-SR Challenge. In contrast to the commonly used perceptual loss that adopts a VGG network trained for image classification, we develop a more suitable perceptual loss for SR -MINC loss. It is based on a fine-tuned VGG network for material recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, which focuses on textures rather than object. Although the gain of perceptual index brought by MINC loss is marginal, we still believe that exploring perceptual loss that focuses on texture is critical for SR. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Representative feature maps before and after activation for image 'baboon'. With the network going deeper, most of the features after activation become inactive while features before activation contains more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Network Interpolation</head><p>To remove unpleasant noise in GAN-based methods while maintain a good perceptual quality, we propose a flexible and effective strategy -network interpolation. Specifically, we first train a PSNR-oriented network G PSNR and then obtain a GAN-based network G GAN by fine-tuning. We interpolate all the corresponding parameters of these two networks to derive an interpolated model G INTERP , whose parameters are:</p><p>are the parameters of G INTERP , G PSNR and G GAN , respectively, and α ∈ [0, 1] is the interpolation parameter.</p><p>The proposed network interpolation enjoys two merits. First, the interpolated model is able to produce meaningful results for any feasible α without introducing artifacts. Second, we can continuously balance perceptual quality and fidelity without re-training the model.</p><p>We also explore alternative methods to balance the effects of PSNR-oriented and GAN-based methods. For instance, one can directly interpolate their output images (pixel by pixel) rather than the network parameters. However, such an approach fails to achieve a good trade-off between noise and blur, i.e., the interpolated image is either too blurry or noisy with artifacts (see Sec. 4.4). Another method is to tune the weights of content loss and adversarial loss, i.e., the parameter λ and η in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3)</ref>. But this approach requires tuning loss weights and fine-tuning the network, and thus it is too costly to achieve continuous control of the image style.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Training Details</head><p>Following SRGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, all experiments are performed with a scaling factor of ×4 between LR and HR images. We obtain LR images by down-sampling HR images using the MATLAB bicubic kernel function. The mini-batch size is set to 16. The spatial size of cropped HR patch is 128 × 128. We observe that training a deeper network benefits from a larger patch size, since an enlarged receptive field helps to capture more semantic information. However, it costs more training time and consumes more computing resources. This phenomenon is also observed in PSNR-oriented methods (see supplementary material ).</p><p>The training process is divided into two stages. First, we train a PSNRoriented model with the L1 loss. The learning rate is initialized as 2 × 10 −4 and decayed by a factor of 2 every 2 × 10 5 iterations. We then employ the trained PSNR-oriented model as an initialization for the generator. The generator is trained using the loss function in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) with λ = 5 × 10 −3 and η = 1 × 10 −2 . The learning rate is set to 1 × 10 −4 and halved at [50k, 100k, 200k, 300k] iterations. Pre-training with pixel-wise loss helps GAN-based methods to obtain more visually pleasing results. We use Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> and alternately update the generator and discriminator network until the model converges.</p><p>For training data, we mainly use the DIV2K dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, which is a highquality (2K resolution) dataset for image restoration tasks. Beyond the training set of DIV2K that contains 800 images, we also seek for other datasets with rich and diverse textures for our training. To this end, we further use the Flickr2K dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> consisting of 2650 2K high-resolution images collected on the Flickr website, and the OutdoorSceneTraining (OST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> dataset to enrich our training set. We empirically find that using this large dataset with richer textures helps the generator to produce more natural results, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref>.</p><p>We train our models in RGB channels and augment the training dataset with random horizontal flips and 90 degree rotations. We evaluate our models on widely used benchmark datasets -Set5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, Set14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, BSD100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, Urban100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, and the PIRM self-validation dataset that is provided in the PIRM-SR Challenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Qualitative Results</head><p>We compare our final models on several public benchmark datasets with state-ofthe-art PSNR-oriented methods including SRCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, EDSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and RCAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>, and also with perceptual-driven approaches including SRGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> and En-hanceNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Since there is no effective and standard metric for perceptual quality, we present some representative qualitative results in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. PSNR (evaluated on the luminance channel in YCbCr color space) and the perceptual index used in the PIRM-SR Challenge are also provided for reference.</p><p>It can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> that our proposed ESRGAN outperforms previous approaches in both sharpness and details. For instance, ESRGAN can Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>: Qualitative results of ESRGAN. ESRGAN produces more natural textures, e.g., animal fur, building structure and grass texture, and also less unpleasant artifacts, e.g., artifacts in the face by SRGAN.</p><p>produce sharper and more natural baboon's whiskers and grass textures (see image 43074) than PSNR-oriented methods, which tend to generate blurry results, and than previous GAN-based methods, whose textures are unnatural and contain unpleasing noise. ESRGAN is capable of generating more detailed structures in building (see image 102061) while other methods either fail to produce enough details (SRGAN) or add undesired textures (EnhanceNet). Moreover, previous GAN-based methods sometimes introduce unpleasant artifacts, e.g., SRGAN adds wrinkles to the face. Our ESRGAN gets rid of these artifacts and produces natural results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Ablation Study</head><p>In order to study the effects of each component in the proposed ESRGAN, we gradually modify the baseline SRGAN model and compare their differences. The overall visual comparison is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref>. Each column represents a model with its configurations shown in the top. The red sign indicates the main improvement compared with the previous model. A detailed discussion is provided as follows. BN removal. We first remove all BN layers for stable and consistent performance without artifacts. It does not decrease the performance but saves the computational resources and memory usage. For some cases, a slight improvement can be observed from the 2 nd and 3 rd columns in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref> (e.g., image 39). Furthermore, we observe that when a network is deeper and more complicated, the model with BN layers is more likely to introduce unpleasant artifacts. The examples can be found in the supplementary material. Before activation in perceptual loss. We first demonstrate that using features before activation can result in more accurate brightness of reconstructed images. To eliminate the influences of textures and color, we filter the image with a Gaussian kernel and plot the histogram of its gray-scale counterpart. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9a</ref> shows the distribution of each brightness value. Using activated features skews the distribution to the left, resulting in a dimmer output while using features before activation leads to a more accurate brightness distribution closer to that of the ground-truth.</p><p>We can further observe that using features before activation helps to produce sharper edges and richer textures as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9b</ref> (see bird feather) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref> (see the 3 rd and 4 th columns), since the dense features before activation offer a stronger supervision than that a sparse activation could provide. RaGAN. RaGAN uses an improved relativistic discriminator, which is shown to benefit learning sharper edges and more detailed textures. For example, in the 5 th column of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref>, the generated images are sharper with richer textures than those on their left (see the baboon, image 39 and image 43074). Deeper network with RRDB. Deeper model with the proposed RRDB can further improve the recovered textures, especially for the regular structures like the roof of image 6 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref>, since the deep model has a strong representation capacity to capture semantic information. Also, we find that a deeper model can reduce unpleasing noises like image 20 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref>.   In contrast to SRGAN, which claimed that deeper models are increasingly difficult to train, our deeper model shows its superior performance with easy training, thanks to the improvements mentioned above especially the proposed RRDB without BN layers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Network Interpolation</head><p>We compare the effects of network interpolation and image interpolation strategies in balancing the results of a PSNR-oriented model and GAN-based method. We apply simple linear interpolation on both the schemes. The interpolation  parameter α is chosen from 0 to 1 with an interval of 0.2.</p><p>As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref>, the pure GAN-based method produces sharp edges and richer textures but with some unpleasant artifacts, while the pure PSNRoriented method outputs cartoon-style blurry images. By employing network interpolation, unpleasing artifacts are reduced while the textures are maintained. By contrast, image interpolation fails to remove these artifacts effectively. Interestingly, it is observed that the network interpolation strategy provides a smooth control of balancing perceptual quality and fidelity in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">The PIRM-SR Challenge</head><p>We take a variant of ESRGAN to participate in the PIRM-SR Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Specifically, we use the proposed ESRGAN with 16 residual blocks and also empirically make some modifications to cater to the perceptual index. 1) The MINC loss is used as a variant of perceptual loss, as discussed in Sec. 3.3. Despite the marginal gain on the perceptual index, we still believe that exploring perceptual loss that focuses on texture is crucial for SR. 2) Pristine dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, which is used for learning the perceptual index, is also employed in our training; 3) a high weight of loss L 1 up to η = 10 is used due to the PSNR constraints; 4) we also use back projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> as post-processing, which can improve PSNR and sometimes lower the perceptual index.</p><p>For other regions 1 and 2 that require a higher PSNR, we use image interpolation between the results of our ESRGAN and those of a PSNR-oriented method RCAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. The image interpolation scheme achieves a lower perceptual index (lower is better) although we observed more visually pleasing results by using the network interpolation scheme. Our proposed ESRGAN model won the first place in the PIRM-SR Challenge (region 3) with the best perceptual index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented an ESRGAN model that achieves consistently better perceptual quality than previous SR methods. The method won the first place in the PIRM-SR Challenge in terms of the perceptual index. We have formulated a novel architecture containing several RDDB blocks without BN layers. In addition, useful techniques including residual scaling and smaller initialization are employed to facilitate the training of the proposed deep model. We have also introduced the use of relativistic GAN as the discriminator, which learns to judge whether one image is more realistic than another, guiding the generator to recover more detailed textures. Moreover, we have enhanced the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which offer stronger supervision and thus restore more accurate brightness and realistic textures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 4 :</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Fig. 4: Left: We remove the BN layers in residual block in SRGAN.
