<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N THE ERA of smart phones and tablet PCs, there is a demand for flawless high-rate wireless multimedia services. On the other hand, bandwidth is a valuable commodity and therefore the information has to be transmitted over the communication channel as efficiently as possible due to the bandlimited nature of communication networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Furthermore, the capacity of wireless systems is interference limited, hence cannot be readily increased by simply increasing the transmitted power <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Therefore, flexible and bandwidth-efficient transceivers have to be designed for supporting wireless multimedia services.</p><p>The history of channel coding dates back to Shannon's pioneering work in 1948 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, where it was predicted that reliable communication can be achieved with the aid of channel coding by incorporating redundancy into the transmitted message. Ever since Shannon quantified the capacity of a communications system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, researchers have endeavoured to devise high-speed, high-quality wireless communication systems exhibiting both a high bit rate and a low Bit Error Rate (BER). Advances in coding made it feasible to approach Shannon's capacity limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Channel coding dates back to the 1950s, when the first Hamming codes were invented <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Convolutional codes were introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and then several algorithms were proposed for their decoding in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Then Viterbi invented the Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE) algorithm in 1967 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, which was a major breakthrough for convolutional codes. In 1974, the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) algorithm was proposed for attaining the minimum BER for the convolutional codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>However, the MAP algorithm has not been widely employed until the invention of turbo codes, because its complexity was substantially higher than that of the Viterbi algorithm, whilst its performance was only marginally better.</p><p>The concept of concatenated codes was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, it was not until the turbo codes were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> that the concept of iterative decoding at low complexity became a reality with the employment of simple constituent codes. Turbo codes use parallel concatenation of two Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) codes accommodating an interleaver between the two constituent encoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. The concept of turbo codes was extended to multiple parallel concatenated codes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Then, the turbo principle was extended to both serially concatenated block and convolutional codes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> the concept and design rules of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) and BICM relying on Iterative Detection (BICM-ID) were presented.</p><p>Substantial efforts have been invested in optimising the performance of concatenated codes in order to improve the slopes of their BER curves and to attain a near-capacity performance. Recently, significant efforts have also been dedicated to studying the convergence behaviour of iterative decoding. Semi-analytical tools devised for analysing the convergence behaviour of iteratively decoded systems were proposed in <ref type="bibr">[23-26, 28, 31, 33-36, 41-43, 45, 46]</ref>. The Mutual Information (MI) between the data bits at the transmitter and the soft values at the receiver were used for describing the exchange of extrinsic information between the decoders in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The exchange of extrinsic information between the constituent decoders may be visualised by EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts <ref type="bibr">[23-25, 46, 48]</ref>. EXIT charts characterise the flow of information between the constituent decoders of a concatenated structure. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> the computation of EXIT charts was simplified for the scenario when the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the transmitted message is symmetric. An insightful tutorial introduction to EXIT charts was provided by Hagenauer in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Additionally, several algorithms predicting the decoding convergence of iterative decoding schemes were compared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>The concept of EXIT charts was further developed for analysing three-stage concatenated systems by Ten Brink in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, TÃ¼chler in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and Brannstrom in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> an algorithm was proposed for finding the optimal decoder activation order, namely for determining the order of softinformation exchange among the three components. Additionally, a beneficial technique was suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> for projecting three-dimensional EXIT functions onto a single two-dimensional EXIT chart. Furthermore, it was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> to create systems exhibiting beneficial decoding convergence after a fixed number of iterations, which resulted in a complexity reduction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRINCIPLE</head><p>The concatenation of low-complexity channel codes constitutes a convenient technique of constructing powerful codes capable of approaching the capacity, while having a moderate decoding complexity. Serially concatenated codes were proposed in 1966 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, while the discovery of parallel concatenated codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> improved the achievable system performance </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D E M U X Î  Î  -1 Î  M U X u 1 c 1 u 2 c 2 E(u 1 )</formula><p>A(u 2 )</p><p>A(c 1 )</p><p>A(c 2 )</p><p>A(u 1 )</p></div>

Encoder and decoder structure of a parallel concatenated code <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>by separating the constituent codes using interleavers for the sake of exchanging sufficient decorrelated extrinsic information between the constituent decoders in order to improve the system's BER <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Iterative decoding and the turbo principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> can be employed for both parallel concatenated codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and serially concatenated codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. In this section we provide a rudimentary overview of the different concatenated code schemes, including both parallel and serial concatenated structures.</p><p>The block diagram of parallel concatenated codes is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A(c2) E(u2) A(c1) E(u1) A(u2) E(c1)</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Encoder and decoder structure of a two-stage serial concatenated code <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>u 2 is encoded by Encoder 2. The role of this interleaver is that of ensuring that the parity-related redundancy appropriately inserted into the original information bit-stream is spread across a long sequence. The rationale of this is that this way each information bit is protected by parity bits, which are less likely to be affected by the same channel effects, as the information bits they are protecting. The output of the two encoders is then multiplexed and transmitted, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. At the receiver side, the two decoders, namely Decoder 1 and Decoder 2 of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, exchange soft information in the form of Logarithmic-Likelihood Ratio (LLR), where the notations A(.) and E(.) used in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> refer to the Extrinsic and a priori LLRs of the bits, respectively. First, the received data is demultiplexed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and then the LLRs representing the encoded bit streams c 1 and c 2 are passed to their corresponding decoders. Decoder 1 generates the extrinsic LLRs E(u 1 ), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, which are then interleaved to form the a priori LLRs A(u 2 ) for Decoder 2. To elaborate a little further, the bit providing a priori information from Decoder 2 would have travelled through the channel with a high time-displacement and hence is likely to be affected by statistically independent propagation phenomena. This results in time diversity.</p><p>Decoder 2 uses the a priori LLRs A(c 2 ) and A(u 2 ) in order to generate improved extrinsic LLRs E(u 2 ), which are then de-interleaved and passed to Decoder 1 as a priori LLRs, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In other words, the interleaver/deinterleaver pair simply order the soft information in the correct order. Decoder 1 then uses the a priori LLRs for getting an improved extrinsic LLRs E(u 1 ), which are then passed to Decoder 2 for further iterations.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the block diagram of a non-systematic parallel concatenated code. It is possible to design a systematic parallel concatenated code, where in addition to encoding the input bit stream in encoders 1 and 2, the input bit stream is simply passed to the output. In the decoder of the systematic parallel concatenated codes, the extrinsic information is exchanged between the two constituent decoders, while also benefiting from the a priori LLRs provided for the systematic bits <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a parallel concatenated code using two constituent codes. It is possible to use more than two constituent codes leading to multiple-stage turbo codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Additionally, the constituent codes used in turbo codes may be from any arbitrary channel code family, although Convolutional Codes (CC) are used most frequently.</p><p>On the other hand, iterative decoding may be applied to serially concatenated systems as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> for two-stage and three-stage concatenated systems, respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the encoder and decoder block diagrams of a two-stage serially concatenated system consisting of an outer encoder, Encoder 1 of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, followed by an interleaver connected to an inner encoder, Encoder 2 of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Again, the interleaver is used for introducing time-diversity by scrambling the bit sequence and hence providing independent a priori information, which is capable of reducing the effects of deep fades on the output of the outer decoder. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the input bit stream u 1 is first encoded by Encoder 1 to generate the bit sequence c 1 , which is then interleaved by interleaver Î  of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The interleaved bit stream u 2 is then encoded by Encoder 2 to produce the bit stream c 2 . In the decoder of the two-stage serially concatenated codes, the a priori LLRs A(c 2 ) of bits c 2 are passed to Decoder 2, which outputs its extrinsic LLRs E(u 2 ). The output of Decoder 2 is then de-interleaved and passed to Decoder 1 as a priori LLRs, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Similarly to parallel concatenated codes, the role of the interleaver/de-interleaver pair is to ensure the correct ordering/alignment of the a priori information.</p><p>Decoder 1 then decodes the input soft information and output its extrinsic LLRs E(c 1 ), which are then interleaved and passed back to Decoder 2 as a priori LLRs. Decoder 2 then uses its a priori LLRs input in order to provide improved extrinsic LLRs, which are passed to Decoder 1 and are then used for further iterations, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. After the last iteration, Decoder 1 outputs the extrinsic LLRs for its data input stream E(u 1 ), which can be passed to a hard decision decoder. In the receiver of the two-stage system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> iterative decoding is implemented by exchanging soft information between the two constituent decoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Over the years, the concept of iterative decoding of serially concatenated schemes was extended to turbo equalisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, coded modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, multiuser detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and to joint channel-estimation and datadetection plus synchronisation as well as joint source-channel decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, the serially concatenated design may be extended to more than two constituent codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref> as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> for a three-stage system. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the block diagrams of the encoder and decoder for a three-stage serially concatenated code. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the data is encoded in three constituent encoders Encoder 1, Encoder 2 and Encoder 3, invoking the interleavers Î  1 and Î  2 between the encoders. In the decoder of the three-stage serially concatenated codes of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, extrinsic information is exchanged between the three constituent decoders in order to attain an improved BER.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Interleaver Design</head><p>Interleavers are used between the constituent codes of both serial or parallel concatenated structures in order to reduce the correlations between the data exchanged between the decoders and hence to provide as independent extrinsic information between the constituent decoders as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Furthermore, the interleavers are also useful in terms of spreading a burst of errors across the whole decoded frame, hence effectively transforming a bursty channel into a random channel.

Encoder and decoder structure of a three-stage serial concatenated code <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>be independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Furthermore, using longer interleavers typically leads to more Gaussian-like LLR distributions and hence the system's performance may approach Shannon's capacity limit more closely <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The interleaver has been shown to be an essential component of iterative decoding and its length is the dominant factor in determining the code's distance properties, which in turn determines the asymptotic performance of iteratively decoded systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. The goal of the interleaver is to improve the distance properties of the code <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. In summary, the interleaver design substantially affects both the BER "turbo cliff" as well as the error floor. Several interleaver designs were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> for increasing the minimum Hamming distance of parallel concatenated codes. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, at high SNR values, the asymptotic BER of a turbo code decreases linearly upon increasing the interleaver length. The interleaver designs may be categorised as random and deterministic. The random interleavers actually rely on pseudo-random sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Several pseudo-random interleavers, such as the S-random interleaver, were described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. On the other hand, the deterministic interleavers are parametrised and hence do not require as large a memory as a random interleaver. Several deterministic interleaver designs were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to parallel concatenated turbo codes, the serially concatenated codes use interleavers associated with different Hamming distance properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. A theoretical framework conceived for the optimisation of interleavers designed for serially concatenated systems was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, where the optimisation cost function was related to the asymptotic performance of the system. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, an interleaver was proposed for serially concatenated convolutional codes, which was designed for mitigating the correlation between the neighbouring LLRs. This approach increased the minimum Hamming distance and hence reduced the corresponding error floor. Finally, an interleaver algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> for achieving a specific minimum Hamming distance, which is limited only by the degree of freedom offered by the interleaver length.

Log-likelihood ratios</head><p>The soft information exchanged between the constituent decoders of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> is used in the form of Logarithmic-Likelihood Ratios, or LLRs for short. The concept of LLR was proposed by Robertson in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> in order to simplify the passing of information between the constituent decoders and is now widely used in iterative decoding litera- ture. The LLR of a bit b k is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L(b k ) ln P (u k = +1) P (u k = -1) , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where L(b k ) denotes the LLR of bit b k and is defined as the logarithm of the ratios of the probability of the bit b k assuming its two legitimate values. P (u k ) denotes the probability of bit u k having values of +1 and -1. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows how the LLR varies with the probability of u k = +1. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, the sign of the LLR indicates whether the bit u k is more likely to be +1 or -1, while the magnitude of the LLR gives an indication of how likely it is that the sign of the LLR gives the correct value of u k . When the LLR L(u k ) â 0, the probability that the bit u k = +1 is equivalent to the probability that the bit u k = -1, i.e. P (u k = +1) = P (u k = -1) = 0.5, which indicates that there is no real certainty about the value of u k . On the other hand, when L(u k ) 0, then P (u k = +1) P (u k = -1) and hence it is highly likely that u k = +1. Similarly, when L(u k ) 0, then P (u k = +1) P (u k = -1) and hence it is highly likely that u k = -1.</p></div>

LLRs L a vary with the corresponding MI values. The bit sequence in this case consists entirely of logical '1's, which is equivalent to x = +1, implying that a positive LLR value L a corresponds to a correct hard decision, while a negative one corresponds to an incorrect hard decision. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, an all-zeros LLR sequence corresponds to a MI of 0, indicating a low confidence that the transmitted bits are 1 or 0. More explicitly, the probabilities that a 1 or 0 is transmitted are equal. It may be seen from Figs. 7-10 that as the number of negative LLR values decreases, i.e. more LLRs become positive, and the LLR magnitude increases, the corresponding MI increases. By contrast, when the LLR magnitudes are high positive numbers, the MI approaches 1, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>. Conversely, when the MI is low, i.e. close to 0, the corresponding LLRs will have a low magnitude and the wrong sign. As seen in Figs. 7-10, when the MI value increases, the number of LLRs with the incorrect sign is reduced and the magnitude of the correct LLRs is increased until all the LLRs reach a high magnitude with the correct polarity, corresponding to a MI of 1.</p></div>

The outer RSC decoder's extrinsic output information I o,e (c) becomes the demapper's a priori input information I i,a (u), which is represented on the x-axis of the EXIT chart. Similarly, on the y-axis we plot the demapper's extrinsic output information I i,e (u), which becomes the outer RSC decoder's a priori input information I o,a (c). The EXIT curves presented in this section correspond to the system employing a 1/2-rate RSC code having a constraint length of K=3, denoted as RSC(2,1,3), in conjunction with an octal GP of (G r , G) = <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">17</ref> shows the EXIT chart of the iteratively detected RSC-coded system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref> employing QPSK relying on the AGM <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref> of Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref>. Ideally, in order for the exchange of extrinsic information between the demapper and the outer RSC decoder to converge for the sake of achieving a vanishingly low BER at a specific E b /N 0 value, the EXIT curve of the demapper at the E b /N 0 value of interest and the extrinsic MI transfer curve of the outer RSC decoder should not intersect before reaching the (1.0, 1.0) point. This implies that given I a = 1.0, we have I e = 1.0 and provided that this condition is satisfied, a so-called open-convergence tunnel <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> appears in the EXIT chart. The narrower the tunnel, the more iterations are required for reaching the (1.0, 1.0) point and the closer the BER curve approaches the vertical line representing the channel capacity. If however, the two extrinsic MI transfer characteristics intersect at a point close to the vertical line at I i,a (u) = 1.0 rather than at the (1.0, 1.0) point, then a low BER may still be achieved, although it will remain higher than the BER of the schemes having an intersection at the (1.0, 1.0) point. These types of EXIT tunnels are referred to here as semi-convergent tunnels. Observe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">17</ref> that a semi-convergent tunnel exists at around E b /N 0 =8.0 dB. This implies that according to the predictions of the EXIT chart seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">17</ref>, the iterative decoding process is expected to converge at an E b /N 0 value between 8.0 dB and 9.0 dB. These EXIT chart based decoding convergence predictions are usually verified by the Monte-Carlo simulation based iterative decoding trajectory, as will be discussed in Section III-B4.  Observe in the EXIT chart of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">17</ref> that once a semiconvergent tunnel is formed, the intersection point of the extrinsic MI transfer characteristic curves of the inner symbolto-bit demapper and the outer RSC decoder gradually moves towards the (1.0, 1.0) point upon increasing the SNR. In order to investigate how the position of the intersection point affects the BER performance, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">18</ref> shows the achievable BER as a function of the mutual information I o,e (c) at the output of the RSC decoder for different constraint lengths. According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">18</ref>, the point of intersection should be at least at I o,e (c) = 0.985 in order to achieve a BER of 10 -3 , which is practically independent of the RSC code's constraint length. This is true, because Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">18</ref> relates the MI at the output of the RSC decoder to the achievable BER. Fig. <ref type="figure">19</ref>, however, relates the MI at the input of the RSC decoder to the achievable BER. The effect of the code's constraint length becomes evident in Fig. <ref type="figure">19</ref>, since RSC codes having higher constraint lengths require lower I o,a (c) values in order to achieve a similar BER. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>      <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">22</ref> shows that during the second iteration the amplitude of the LLRs increases and there are less LLRs with a negative sign. The MI in this case is I o,e (c) = 0.935. As shown in the decoding trajectory of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">20</ref>, there is no further gain after two iterations and the EXIT curves of the inner demapper and the outer RSC decoder intersect before reaching the (1.0, 1.0) point. Hence there will be still residual errors in this case and this is clearly indicated by the LLRs with the negative sign in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">22</ref>.</p><p>The BER of the iteratively decoded system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref> is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">23</ref>.

As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">23</ref>, the BER performance of the GM-aided system does not improve upon increasing the number of iterations and this matches the EXIT chart prediction of Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref>, where the GM-based system has a flat EXIT transfer function. On the other hand, the AGM-based system's performance improves upon increasing the number of iterations from 0 to 1, but beyond that the BER performance no longer improves upon increasing the number of iterations. This trend is confirmed by the decoding trajectory of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">20</ref>, where it was shown that the EXIT curves of the inner demapper and the outer RSC decoder intersect after the first iteration. Also note that the BER curves of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">23</ref> do not exhibit a sharply decaying "turbo-cliff" shape that is expected in an iteratively decoded system. This is due to the fact that the EXIT transfer functions of the inner and outer decoders intersect before reaching the (1.0, 1.0) point of perfect convergence to an infinitesimally low BER and hence we experience a gradually, rather than sharply, decaying BER curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">23</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. EXIT chart analysis of a two-stage serially concatenated system using a recursive inner code</head><p>The BER results shown in the previous section did not exhibit a steep turbo-cliff due to the fact that the EXIT curve of the inner demapper and the outer RSC decoder intersected before reaching the (1.0, 1.0) point. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> that a recursive inner decoder component is needed in order to maximise the interleaver gain and to avoid the formation of a BER floor, when employing iterative decoding. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, unityrate inner codes were employed for designing low-complexity  iterative detection aided schemes suitable for bandwidth and power limited systems having stringent BER requirements. Hence, in this section we consider the iteratively decoded system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>, where iterative detection is carried out by exchanging extrinsic information between the outer RSC decoder and the inner Unity-Rate Code's (URC) decoder. An explicit benefit of the URC is that it has an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and hence it efficiently spreads/randomises the extrinsic information without increasing the interleaver delay and without reducing the throughput. This is achieved at a modest complexity increase, because a memory-1 URC has only two trellis states. The schematic of the proposed system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>, where the transmitted source bits b are convolutionally encoded by a 1/2-rate memory-2 K = 3 RSC code having a GP octally represented as (G r , G)= <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>. The RSC encoded bit stream c is then interleaved by a random bit interleaver. Following channel interleaving the bit stream u is encoded by a URC encoder. More specifically, the URC encoder is a simple rate-1 memory-1 accumulator, which is described by the pair of octal GPs of (G r , G) = (3, 2). The QPSK mapper of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> then maps the RSC coded and URC precoded bits to QPSK symbols for transmission from a single antenna. Similarly to Section III-B, we consider transmission over a temporally correlated narrowband Rayleigh fading channel associated with a normalised Doppler frequency of</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">f D =f d T s =0.01.</formula><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>, the received complex-valued symbols are first demodulated and demapped to the soft values of L M (d), which are then passed to the URC decoder. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>, the URC decoder processes the information provided by the demapper in conjunction with the a priori information L i,a (u) passed from the RSC decoder, in order to generate the extrinsic LLRs L i,e (u). Then the LLRs L i,e (u) are deinterleaved by a soft-bit deinterleaver, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>. Next, the soft-bit values L o,a (c) are passed to the RSC decoder of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> in order to compute the extrinsic LLRs L o,e (c). More iterations are performed by exchanging soft extrinsic information between the RSC and URC decoders. During the last iteration, only the LLR values of the original uncoded systematic information bits are required, which are passed to the hard decision decoder of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> in order to determine the estimated transmitted source bits.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">25</ref> depicts the EXIT chart of the iterative detection aided channel-coded system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> employing GM QPSK in conjunction with the 1/2-rate RSC outer code and URC inner code for different E b /N 0 values. The classic GM was used in this case, because no iterations are invoked between the demapper and the decoders and thus, in this case, it is better to use GM that results in a higher initial MI and hence at higher starting point at I A = 0 in the EXIT curve. Ideally, in order for the exchange of extrinsic information between the URC decoder and the RSC decoder to converge at a specific E b /N 0 value, the EXIT curve of the URC decoder and that of the outer RSC decoder should only intersect at a point near the   Fig. <ref type="figure">27</ref>. BER performance of the 1/2-rate, K = 3 RSC-coded and URCprecoded scheme of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> employing GM QPSK, while using an interleaver depth of 800, 000 bits. Contrast the significantly improved BER performance to that seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">23</ref> for the scheme of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref> dispensing with URC. The EXIT chart based convergence predictions may be verified by the Monte-Carlo simulation based iterative decoding trajectory of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">26</ref>, where the trajectory at E b /N 0 =4.4 dB is recorded, while using an interleaver depth of 800, 000 bits. The steps seen in the figure represent the actual extrinsic MI transfer between the inner URC decoder and the outer RSC decoder. Since a long interleaver is employed, the assumptions outlined at the beginning of Section III namely those of having uncorrelated and Gaussian distributed a priori LLRs, are justified and hence the EXIT chart based convergence prediction becomes accurate. On the other hand, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">28</ref> shows the trajectory of the iteratively decoded system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> at E b /N 0 =3.6 dB, while using an interleaver depth of 800, 000 bits. Observe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">28</ref> that the open tunnel recorded at E b /N 0 = 3.6 dB is narrower than that at E b /N 0 = 3.6 dB as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">26</ref>. Hence, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">26</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">28</ref>, more iterations are needed for reaching the point of perfect convergence at (1.0, 1.0) at 3.6 dB than at 4.4 dB. Fig. <ref type="figure">27</ref> shows the attainable performance of the RSC-coded and URC-precoded system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> employing GM QPSK in conjunction with a 1/2-rate RSC code and an interleaver depth of 800, 000 bits, while using a gradually increasing number of decoding iterations between the RSC and URC decoders of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>. Observe in Fig. <ref type="figure">27</ref> that there is an evident performance improvement, when increasing the number of iterations as compared to the modest improvement recoreded for the system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref> dispensing with the inner recursive URC encoder. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">27</ref>, the system attains an infinitesimally low BER at around E b /N 0 = 3.6 dB, which matches with QPSK GM URC, RSC(2,1,3) 20 iters 800,000 bits 100,000 bits 10,000 bits 1,000 bits the EXIT chart prediction of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">25</ref>. Furthermore, according to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">25</ref> there is an open tunnel between the inner and outer decoders' EXIT curves at E b /N 0 just above 3.0 dB. This implies that it is possible to obtain an infinitesimally low BER at E b /N 0 just above 3.0 dB, albeit this requires a large number of iterations since the tunnel will become narrow. This suggests that near-capacity operation imposes a high complexity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">E b /N 0 [dB] â£â£â£â£ â£â£â£ â£â£â£ â£â£ â£â£ â£ â£ â£ â£ â£ â£ QPSK GM URC, RCS(2,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Effect of interleaver depth on the accuracy of the EXIT chart prediction</head><p>At the beginning of Section III, we mentioned the assumptions used for the application of the EXIT charts, namely that the apriori LLRs are fairly uncorrelated and the PDF of the Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref>.

These assumptions are valid, when using sufficiently high interleaver lengths. Below we will show the effect of varying the interleaver length on the accuracy of EXIT chart predictions. Figs. 29, 30 and 31 record the Monte-Carlo simulation based decoding trajectory of the iteratively detected system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>, while operating at E b /N 0 =3.6 dB associated with interleaver depths of 100, 000 bits, 10, 000 bits and 1, 000 bits, respectively. The decoding trajectory of Fig. <ref type="figure">29</ref> employs an interleaver depth of 100, 000 bits, where the decoding trajectory is different from that observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">28</ref>. In other words, the system employing a shorter interleaver requires more iterations to reach the highest point of intersection between the EXIT curves of the inner URC decoder and the outer RSC decoder. Additionally as I i,a (u) increases, the Monte-Carlo decoding trajectory starts to deviate from the EXIT curves of the URC or RSC decoders, because the LLR distribution is no longer Gaussian for high I i,a (u) values.</p><p>The Monte-Carlo simulation based decoding trajectories shown in Fig <ref type="figure">30</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">31</ref> became even more different from the EXIT chart predictions because shorter interleavers are used and thus the assumptions stipulated at the beginning of Section III become even less accurate. More explicitly, when using shorter interleavers, the LLRs L i,a (u) are no longer near-Gaussian distributed. This implies that the EXIT chart prediction of having an open tunnel at E b /N 0 &gt; 3.0 dB and hence a low BER at this E b /N 0 value is no longer valid for low interleaver lengths. This is verified by the BER performance curves shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_28">32</ref>.</p><p>The BER performance of the iteratively detected RSCcoded and URC precoded scheme of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> using 20 iterations and varying the interleaver depth is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_28">32</ref>. As seen in the figure, upon increasing the interleaver depth from 1, 000 bits to 10, 000 bits, the system's performance dramatically improves. Upon further increasing the interleaver depth from 10, 000 bits to 100, 000 bits, the attainable performance improves, but not as much as upon increasing it from 1, 000 to 10, 000 bits. Furthermore, increasing the interleaver depth beyond 100, 000 bits fails to significantly improve the achievable system performance, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_28">32</ref>, while comparing the BER curves recorded for the interleaver lengths of 800, 000 bits and 100, 000 bits.</p></div>

Furthermore, extrinsic soft information can be exchanged between the demapper and URC decoder resulting in a three-stage iteratively decoded system The schematic of the three-stage system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref>, where the transmitted source bits b are encoded by the outer RSC Encoder I having a rate of R I . Similarly to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>, the outer channel encoded bits c 1 are then interleaved by the first random bit interleaver Î  1 of Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref>, where the randomly permuted bits u 1 are fed through the URC Encoder II. The URC coded bits c 2 at the output of the URC encoder are interleaved by the second random bit interleaver Î  2 , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref>, producing the permuted bits u 2 . After bit interleaving, the bits are mapped to QPSK symbols for transmission.</p><p>Similarly to Section III-B we consider transmission over a temporally correlated narrowband Rayleigh fading channel associated with a normalised Doppler frequency of f D =f d T s =0.01. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref>, the received complexvalued symbols r are decoded by the QPSK demapper. Then, iterative demapping/decoding is carried out by exchanging extrinsic information between the QPSK demapper, URC SISO Decoder II and RSC SISO Decoder I. The iterative process is performed for a number of consecutive iterations. During the last iteration, only the LLR values L I,e (b) of the original uncoded systematic information bits b are required, which are passed to a hard decision decoder in order to determine the estimated transmitted source bits, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref>.</p><p>As seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref>, the input of the URC Decoder II is constituted by the a priori input L II,a (c 2 ) and the a priori input L II,a (u 1 ) provided by the demapper and Decoder I after bit deinterleaving, respectively. Therefore, the EXIT characteristic of Decoder II may be described by the following two EXIT functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">I II,e (c 2 ) = T II,c2 [I II,a (u 1 ), I II,a (c 2 ))] (18) I II,e (u 1 ) = T II,u1 [I II,a (u 1 ), I II,a (c 2 )] , (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_38">)</formula><p>which are illustrated by the 3D surfaces drawn in dotted lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">34</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">35</ref>, respectively. On the other hand, the EXIT characteristic of the demapper as well as that of Decoder I are each dependent on a single a priori input, namely on L i,a (u 2 ) and L I,a (c 1 ), respectively, both of which are provided by the URC Decoder II after appropriately ordering the bits by the interleavers, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref>. The EXIT characteristic of the demapper is also dependent on the E b /N 0 value. Consequently, the corresponding EXIT functions drawn for the demapper and Decoder I, respectively, may be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">I I,e (u 2 ) = T i,u2 [I i,a (u 2 ), E b /N 0 ] , (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">) I I,e (c 1 ) = T I,c1 [I I,a (c 1 )] , (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_41">)</formula><p>which are illustrated by the 3D surfaces drawn in solid lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">34</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">35</ref>, respectively. As observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">34</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">35</ref>, it is somewhat cumbersome to interpret the 3D EXIT charts. Fortunately, their unique and unambiguous 2D representations can be deduced, which may be interpreted more readily. More explicitly, the intersection of the surfaces seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">34</ref> is shown as a thick solid line, which characterises the achievable performance when exchanging mutual information between the demapper and the URC Decoder II for different fixed values of I II,a (u 1 ) gleaned for Decoder I and spanning the range of [0, 1]. Each [I II,a (u 1 ), I II,a (c 2 ), I II,e (c 2 )] point belonging to the line of intersection in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">34</ref> uniquely specifies a point [I II,a (u 1 ), I II,a (c 2 ), I II,e (u 1 )] in the 3D space of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">35</ref>, according to the EXIT function of Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Therefore, the line corresponding to the [I II,a (u 1 ), I II,a (c 2 ), I II,e (c 2 )] points along the thick line of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">34</ref> is projected to the solid line shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">35</ref>.

Therefore, the line corresponding to the [I II,a (u 1 ), I II,a (c 2 ), I II,e (c 2 )] points along the thick line of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">34</ref> is projected to the solid line shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">35</ref>, while the 2D projection of the solid line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">35</ref> at I II,a (c 2 ) = 0 onto the plane spanned by the lines [I II,a (u 1 ), I II,e (u 1 )] and [I I,e (c 1 ), I I,a (c 1 )] is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">36</ref> at E b /N 0 = 3.6 dB. More explicitly, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">36</ref> records the 2D-projected EXIT curves for 0 and 20 inner iterations between the demapper and Decoder II. As observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">36</ref>, when no inner iterations are employed, the system becomes essentially a two-stage arrangement as the one shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> of Section III-C.</p><p>According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">36</ref>, regardless whether 0 or 20 inner iterations are employed between the demapper and the URC decoder II, the projected curve has more or less the same shape and an open tunnel is attained for E b /N 0 = 3.6 dB. This implies that a three-stage system relying on the configuration of Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref> may be replace by a simpler two-stage system, which is capable of attaining the same performance.</p><p>On the other hand, the three-stage system of Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref> employing no inner iterations is equivalent to the two-stage system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>.

This is demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">37</ref>, where a RSC code having a constraint length of K = 2 is used. Observe in Fig. <ref type="figure">37</ref> that there is an open tunnel at E b /N 0 = 3.0 dB, which means that it is possible to attain an infinitesimally low BER performance at E b /N 0 = 3.0 dB. However, observe in Fig. <ref type="figure">37</ref> that the open tunnel is a narrow one and hence it requires numerous iterations for the decoding trajectory to reach the (1.0, 1.0) point of perfect convergence. This example demonstrated how powerful EXIT charts can be in optimising the achievable system performance without using exhaustive Monte-Carlo simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Extending the EXIT charts</head><p>EXIT chart analysis was invoked for visualising the convergence behaviour of both two-and three-stage serially concatenated systems, in the previous sections. The analysis may be readily extended to parallel-concatenated systems as follows. When considering the decoder of the parallel concatenated system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the extrinsic output LLRs E(u 1 ) of Decoder 1 constitute the a priori input LLRs A(u 2 ) for Decoder 2 after interleaving. Similarly, the extrinsic output LLRs E(u 2 ) of Decoder 2 become the a priori input LLRs A(u 1 ) of Decoder 1 after deinterleaving. Hence, the MI of the extrinsic output LLRs of Decoder 1 are the same as the MI of the a priori input LLRs of Decoder 2. The same is valid for the MI of the extrinsic LLRs of Decoder 2 and the a priori LLRs of Decoder 1. This implies that an EXIT chart can be generated for the parallel concatenated system of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> by plotting the MI of E(u 1 ) versus the MI of A(u 1 ) for Decoder 1 and plotting the MI of A(u 2 ) versus the MI of E(u 2 ) for Decoder 2.</p><p>It is also possible to consider extending the serial concatenation of soft-input soft-output components beyond a threestage concatenated system. Before describing how a fourstage serially concatenated system can be analysed using EXIT charts, it is worth discussing whether there is any substantial performance gain justifying the complexity of an extra iterative stage. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">36</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">37</ref>, the gain achieved by using a three stage system is less than 0.5 dB compared to the two-stage iteratively decoded system. However, this is attained at the expense of adding the complexity and delay of a new stage of iteration. Hence, using a multiple concatenated stages would not produce any significant gain, despite significantly increasing both the complexity and delay of the system. Furthermore, if we were to consider a fourstage serially concatenated system, then we would need four 3D EXIT charts in order to analyse the system, which makes it quite complicated for producing any useful analysis.</p></div>

By contrast, in the context of discrete-amplitude QAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and PSK <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> signals, we encounter a Discrete-input Continuous-output Memoryless Channel (DCMC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</p><p>It was argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref> that the maximum achievable throughput of the system is equal to the area under the EXIT curve of the inner code, provided that the bit stream input to the demapper has independently and uniformly distributed bits, the channel is an erasure channel, the inner code has a unity rate and the MAP algorithm is used for decoding. Assuming that the area under the EXIT curve of the inner decoder, i.e. the demapper in the system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref> and the URC decode in the system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref>, is represented by A i , then the maximum achievable rate for the outer code specified at a particular E b /N 0 value is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">R max = A i (E b /N 0 ).<label>(23)</label></formula><p>In other words, if A i is calculated for different E b /N 0 values, the maximum achievable bandwidth efficiency Î· max may be formulated as a function of the E b /N 0 value as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">Î· max (E b /N 0 ) = B â¢ R system â¢ R max (24) â B â¢ R system â¢ A i (E b /N 0 ) [bit/sec/Hz],</formula><p>where B is the number of bits per modulated symbol and R system is the rate of transmission of the system.

Furthermore, the output of Algorithm 1 is independent of the specific choice of R o , since Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_46">25</ref>) would always adjust the E b /N 0 values, regardless of R o . The channel capacity curve of the single-antenna aided QPSK modulated system of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref> is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">38</ref>. The figures portrays both the DCMC bandwidth efficiency curve, evaluated according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, as well as the maximum achievable rate of the system derived from the EXIT curves according to Algorithm 1. Observe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">38</ref> that the maximum achievable rate of the system derived from the EXIT curves is almost perfectly matching the DCMC bandwidth efficiency curve. Note that the maximum achievable rate obtained from the EXIT chart was proven mathematically for the family of binary erasure channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Nonetheless, similar experimentally verified trends have been observed for both AWGN and Inter-Symbol-Interference (ISI) contaminated channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, provided that APP-based decoders are used for all decoder blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optimisation of sphere packing constellation mapping</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> a multi-dimensional modulation scheme was introduced, which was referred to as Sphere Packing (SP) modulation combined with twin-antenna aided Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>. SP modulation is capable of maximising the coding advantage of the transmission scheme by jointly designing and detecting the sphere-packed STBC system.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, different GM and AGM schemes were proposed and optimised using EXIT charts. It was shown that EXIT charts can be used for selecting the best configuration of the constellation mapping in conjunction with diverse inner and outer code GPs and constraint lengths.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">39</ref> shows the extrinsic information transfer characteristics of the SP demapper in conjunction with a SP signalling alphabet having L = 16 symbols and different bit-to-symbol mapping schemes. As expected, GM does not provide any iteration gain upon increasing the MI at the input of the demapper. However, using a variety of different AGM schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>  results in different EXIT characteristics, as illustrated by the different slopes seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">39</ref>. There are a total of 16factorial (16!) different mapping schemes. Having different legitimate bit-to-SP symbol mapping schemes provides us with the flexibility for selecting the most appropriate mapping for a specific system design with the aid of EXIT charts. This is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">40</ref>, where the EXIT charts of three possible SP AGM schemes are plotted in conjunction with three possible outer RSC code EXIT curves. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">40</ref>, the AGM-10 scheme requires a higher SNR to generate an open tunnel than the AGM-9 modulated system, which in turn requires a higher SNR for attaining an open tunnel than the AGM-7 based system. This indicates that according to the EXIT chart prediction of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">40</ref>, the AGM-7 based scheme exhibits a turbo cliff at a lower E b /N 0 value than the others, when combined with the specific RSC code having the octal generator polynomials of (G r , G) = (35, 23) 8 . However, the AGM-7 based scheme will acquire the highest BER floor, since the intersection point between the EXIT curves of the inner and outer codes is the lowest amonst the three AGM schemes considered. Therefore, different AGM schemes may be combined with specific RSC codes for the sake of designing systems satisfying specific criteria, such as for example attaining an early convergence or a lower BER floor.</p><p>The BER performance comparison of the systems using the different AGM scheme used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">40</ref> are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">41</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, given the flexibility of the different AGMs, it is possible to optimise a three-stage iteratively detected system similar to that shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref> for SP modulation. More details about this issue can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>EXIT charts and error floor: It is possible to relate the error floor observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">41</ref> to the corresponding EXIT curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">40</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">40</ref>, the EXIT curve of the demapper employing AGM-7 intersects with the EXIT curve of the outer decoder at a point lower than those for the demapper employing AGM-9 and AGM-10. This translates, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">41</ref>, to a higher error floor for AGM-7 than AGM-9 and for AGM-10. This can be explained by referring to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">18</ref>, where lower extrinsic LLRs result in higher BER and hence a higher error floor. The same can be said for comparing the error floors of the systems employing AGM-9 and AGM-10. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">18</ref> shows clearly that a lower output extrinsic LLR of the outer decoder results in a lower BER. This means that the lower the intersection point between the inner and outer decoder EXIT curves, the higher the BER, hence resulting in a higher error floor. Furthermore, in order to get a lower error floor, the output extrinsic MI of the outer decoder, which corresponds to the intersection point between the EXIT curves of the inner and outer decoders, should be as high as 0.998 as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">18</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Design of irregular codes using EXIT charts</head><p>As described in Section III, a narrow but marginally open EXIT-tunnel represents a near-capacity performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Therefore, IrCC were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> for the sake of appropriately shaping the EXIT curves by minimising the area within the EXIT tunnel using curve fitting of the EXIT charts.</p><p>For the sake of illustrating the IrCC concept further, we consider the three-stage system of Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref> as an example. Let A I and ÄI be the areas under the EXIT-curve of Decoder I and its inverse, respectively. Similarly, the area A p is defined as that under the EXIT projection curve. It was observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref> that for the APP-based outer Decoder I, the area ÄI may be approximated by ÄI â R I , where the equality ÄI = R I was later shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> for the family of Binary Erasure Channels (BECs). The area property of ÄI â R I implies that the lowest SNR convergence threshold occurs, when we have A p = R I + , where is an infinitesimally small number.</p><p>Observe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">36</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">37</ref> that there is a wide open tunnel between the EXIT curve of the outer decoder and the EXIT projection curve, especially for I &lt; 0.2 and I &gt; 0.6. This implies that the BER curve is farther from the achievable capacity than necessary. More quantitatively, the area under the EXIT projection curve is A p â 0.57 at E b /N 0 = 3.0 dB, which is larger than the outer code rate of R I = 0.50. Therefore, according to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">36</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">37</ref>  may be attained. In other words, the EXIT curve of the outer code should match the EXIT projection curve more closely. Hence IrCCs can be invoked as an outer code that exhibit flexible EXIT characteristics, which can be optimised for more closely matching the EXIT projection curve of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">36</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">37</ref>, converting the near-capacity code optimisation optimisation to a simple curve-fitting problem. An IrCC scheme constituted by a set of 17 subcodes was constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> from a systematic 1/2-rate memory-4 mother code defined by the octally represented GPs (G r , G) = (31, 27) 8 . Each of the 17 subcodes have a different code rate R i I , âi â <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, where puncturing was employed to obtain the rates of R i I &gt; 0.5 and the code rates of R i I &lt; 0.5 were created by adding more GPs and by puncturing. The two additional GPs employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> are defined by the octally represented GPs of G 1 = (35) 8 and G 2 = (35) 8 , where the resultant 17 subcodes have coding rates spanning the range of [0.1, 0.9]. Each of the 17 subcodes encodes a specific fraction of the uncoded bits determined by the weighting coefficient Î± i , i = 1, . . . , P . Assuming an overall average code rate of R I = 0.5, the following conditions must be satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">17 i=1 Î± i = 1, R I = 17 i=1 Î± i R i I , and Î± i â [0, 1], âi.</formula><p>(26) The EXIT function corresponding to the IrCC may be constructed from the EXIT functions of the 17 subcodes. More specifically, the EXIT function of the IrCC is the weighted superposition of the 17 EXIT functions, as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> T I,c1 [I I,a (c 1 )] = </p><p>Again, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">42</ref> shows the EXIT functions of the 17 subcodes used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Hence the coefficients Î± i are optimised with the aid of the iterative algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, so that the EXIT curve of the resultant IrCC closely matches the EXIT projection curve at that specific E b /N 0 value, where we have A p â 0.50. It is observed that we have A p â 0.501 at E b /N 0 = 2.4 dB. However, observe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">43 that</ref> we have an open tunnel at E b /N 0 = 2.6 dB, indicating that this E b /N 0 value is close to the lowest attainable convergence threshold, when employing a 1/2-rate outer code. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">43</ref> also shows the EXIT curve of the resultant IrCC. It may be inferred from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">43</ref> that an open convergence tunnel is formed around E b /N 0 = 2.6 dB. This implies that according to the predictions of the EXIT chart of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">43</ref>, the iterative decoding process is expected to converge at E b /N 0 = 2.6 dB. However, observe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">43</ref> that the open tunnel at E b /N 0 = 2.6 dB is quite narrow and thus it requires a large number of iterations to converge at E b /N 0 = 2.6 dB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Multi-dimensional constellation labelling</head><p>It is widely recognised that the choice of a specific bit-tosymbol mapping scheme or a beneficial constellation labelling is an influential factor, when designing Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation using Iterative Decoding (BICM-ID) for the sake of achieving a high iteration gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>. Hence, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> an EXIT chart based flexibility measure was introduced for analysing the effect of expanding the constellation to a higherdimensional space by jointly transmitting a pair of symbols of a classic two-dimensional constellation.</p><p>In order to attain a near-capacity performance, the SNR value corresponding to the turbo cliff has to be as low as possible. The crucial point at the receiver is that the concatenated detectors/demappers/decoders are SISO decoders that are capable of accepting and delivering probabilities or soft values, where the extrinsic information of the soft-output of one detector/demapper/decoder is passed on to the other detector/demapper/decoder to be used as its a priori input.</p><p>Several papers studied the multi-dimensional constellation labelling demonstrating that it was beneficial to invoke multidimensional modulation in the context of both TCM and BICM <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. However, these papers did not quantify the achievable improvement, neither did they detail whether the improvement was merely due to the increased number of bits used by the combined symbols allowing for more flexibility in the design of the constellation , or due to the beneficial multi-dimensional labelling. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>, a flexibility measure was proposed based on EXIT charts, where investigations were carried out into the effect of expanding the constellation to more dimensions as well as to quantify the benefits of increasing the classic constellation order. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> that the flexibility improvement of the bit-to-symbol mapping offered by expanding the modulation constellation to a higherdimensional space, when communicating over a Rayleigh channel was mainly due to the increased number of bits-perjoint-symbol. Nonetheless, useful EXIT flexibility improvements may also be obtained by expanding the modulation constellation to a higher-dimensional space, especially when communicating over an independent fading based Rayleigh channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Symbol-based EXIT charts</head><p>The analysis in Section III was presented in the context of iterative decoding at the bit level. However, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> that a reduced transmit power may be required, when symbol-based rather than bit-based iterative decoding is employed.</p><p>The convergence behaviour of bit-based iterative decoding was studied in Section III. EXIT charts have been extended to iterative non-binary coding schemes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, where a histogram-based approximation of the extrinsic information's PDF was required in order to compute the MI. Moreover, the evaluation of the extrinsic information's histogram becomes computationally demanding for a large number of bits per symbol. Hence a reduced-complexity method of computing non-binary EXIT charts was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, which dispenses with the above-mentioned histogram computation and may be considered to constitute a generalisation of the approach presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by the performance improvements reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90]</ref>, a symbol-based iterative scheme was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, where it was shown that the non-binary turbodetection aided scheme is capable of providing further performance improvements over the equivalent bit-based turbodetected scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Coded Modulation</head><p>As mentioned in Section I of this paper, one of the objectives for the design of digital communications is the efficient exploitation of the available bandwidth in order to accommodate the ever-increasing traffic demand. Hence coded modulation was proposed, where it is possible to insert parity bits into the bit sequence and absorb them by expanding the signal constellation in order to accommodate the parity bits without expanding the bandwidth of the un-coded signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref> that the design of coded modulation schemes is affected by different design criteria. While a high squared free Euclidean distance is desired for Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels, a high effective code length and minimum product distance are desired for fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Trellis-Coded Modulation (TCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref> was originally proposed for Gaussian channels, but later it was further developed for applications in mobile communications over fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>. Again, the philosophy of TCM schemes is that they combine channel coding and modulation in a way that the modulated signal constellation is extended to an increased number of constellation points, so that more bits per symbol can be transmitted for the sake of absorbing the parity bits, hence requiring no increase in the bandwidth <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. Turbo Trellis-Coded Modulation (TTCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> is another joint coding and modulation scheme that has a structure similar to that of the family of binary turbo codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, but it employs TCM schemes as component codes.</p><p>The coded modulation design and optimisation has been presented for AWGN channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref>, where the design criteria was that of acquiring a higher free Euclidean distance. Then TCM was redesigned for fading channels, where the criteria is that of attaining a minimum product distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Then, after the introduction of EXIT charts, they were used as a powerful tool in designing and optimising coded modulation techniques, especially because the bit-to-symbol mapping makes the TCM encoder structure more complicated than that of classic turbo codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the EXIT chart concept has been extended to the non-binary case, where serially concatenated systems having an inner TCM component and a space-time convolutional code were analysed. Furthermore, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> that the requirement of having a Gaussian distribution for the a priori LLRs of a decoder can only be really argued based on the properties of the extrinsic information, rather than those of the actual transmission channel. Afterwards, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> was extended to TTCM relying on employing symbol-based EXIT charts. On the other hand, the non-binary EXIT chart technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> was shown to be well-suited to the analysis of non-binary iterative decoding schemes associated with a large index alphabet, such as for example a TTCM system employing a 32-QAM signal set. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, the EXIT chart was utilised in order to develop a design criterion for choosing the constituent codes of TTCM, where the optimization method was developed for constructing high-rate and high-performance serially concatenated TCM schemes.</p><p>The EXIT charts of Self-Concatenated Trellis Coded Modulation (SCTCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref> were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>, where it was found that the symbol-based EXIT charts are fairly accurate in predicting the decoding convergence threshold, despite the inaccurate simplifying assumption that the extrinsic information and the systematic information of each encoded symbol are independent of each other. For example, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> that the EXIT chart analysis of SCTCM schemes allows the designer to determine the number of self-iterations required by the SCTCM decoder for achieving convergence and hence to attain a very low BER <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>.</p><p>Another coded modulation scheme distinguishing itself by utilising bit-based interleaving in conjunction with Gray signal constellation labelling is referred to as Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>. More explicitly, BICM combines conventional convolutional codes with several independent bit interleavers in order to increase the achievable diversity order of a code for transmission over fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>. The number of parallel bit interleavers equals the number of coded bits in a symbol for the BICM scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>. The performance of BICM is better than that of TCM for transmission over uncorrelated or perfectly interleaved narrowband Rayleigh fading channels, but worse than that of TCM in Gaussian channels owing to the reduced Euclidean distance of BICM. Additionally, iterative joint decoding and demodulation assisted BICM (BICM-ID) was proposed in an effort to further increase the achievable system performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>, where the approach of BICM-ID is to increase the Euclidean distance of BICM and hence to exploit the full advantage of bit interleaving with the aid of soft-decision iterative decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The convergence behaviour of BICM-ID was analysed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> for the case of imperfect channel state information, while communicating over fading channels. It was shown using EXIT charts that the correlation coefficient between the fading and its estimate is the key parameter affecting the decoding convergence. Additionally, it was shown that the decoding convergence can be controlled by striking a trade-off between the quality of channel estimation and the code rate. Furthermore, EXIT charts were also used for analysing BICM-ID systems over the an AWGN channel in <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, where the authors develop a generalised model for the a priori inputs. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref> that the demapper and decoder transfer functions are sensitive to over-estimation of the noise variance. Additionally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> a method was proposed for predicting the BERs of BICM-ID for all types of channels, which is based on EXIT charts and avoids extensive BER simulations. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>, the iterative convergence of TCM, TTCM, BICM and DICM-ID was analysed using EXIT charts and a 3dimensional EXIT chart was proposed for studying the iterative convergence behaviour of the multi-stage decoding used in Multi-Level Coding (MLC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. Furthermore, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> a near-capacity irregular BICM-ID (Ir-BICM-ID) scheme was designed, which adopted a design philosophy similar to that of the IrCC scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> that the irregular design of the Ir-BICM-ID scheme pervades the three basic components of BICM-ID, namely the encoder, the unity-rate precoder and the bit-to-symbol mapper, where the proposed ir-BICM-ID schemes are capable of approaching the capacity of coded modulation. Furthermore, since the appropriate choice of the bit-to-symbol mapping, which is also often referred to as constellation labelling, is essential in the design of BICM-ID, EXIT charts were used to design this labelling for BICM-ID in <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Combining EXIT chart and union bounds for system design and analysis</head><p>According to the previous analysis, it has been shown how the EXIT charts can be used as a powerful technique of analysing and designing iteratively decoded system characterised by near-capacity performance. EXIT charts have been successfully applied in both bit-based as well as in symbol-based iteratively detected systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> the lowcomplexity symbol-based EXIT charts proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and the corresponding BER union bound of Turbo Trellis Coded Modulation (TTCM) schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> were employed in order to design new, near-capacity symbol-interleaved TTCM schemes. More specifically, new GPs were sought for the Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> component codes, based on both their decoding convergence and on the error floor of the TTCM decoder, rather than using the classic 'punctured' minimal distance criterion of the TCM component codes defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> the prime design criterion was that of finding a constituent TCM code, where the corresponding EXIT charts exhibit an open tunnel at the lowest possible SNR value, as well as having an acceptable error floor, where the latter was estimated by the truncated symbol-based union bound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. EXIT band charts</head><p>It has been shown in Section III that the EXIT chart and its prediction is accurate for long interleavers, where the LLR's PDF approaches the Gaussian distribution. This implies that the EXIT chart constitutes an accurate technique of predicting the convergence behaviour in the turbo-cliff region of a BER curve, when using long interleavers. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, the EXIT band chart tool was proposed for analysing systems having shorter interleavers.</p><p>The EXIT charts are obtained by evaluating the average MI of the a priori and the extrinsic LLRs, while running several simulations with the aid of long interleavers. In this case, the variance of the different simulations is small. However, when running simulations for shorter interleavers, the MI transfer curve becomes different for each single simulation run even at the same E b /N 0 value for both the inner and outer decoders. In this case, a band of EXIT curves is evaluated for both the inner as well as the outer decoders for each given E b /N 0 value. The band of MI transfer curves is then referred to as the EXIT band <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, where the EXIT chart can be inferred by getting the average of the band. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> that as the interleaver length increases, the width of the EXIT band reduces until we arrive at the EXIT chart valid for long interleavers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Code design</head><p>Since the introduction of turbo codes and iterative decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, substantial research efforts have been invested in improving their performance as well as in reducing their complexity. For example, by choosing the best constituent encoder, a turbo code would achieve an improved performance without increasing its complexity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>, a parameter referred to as the effective free distance was introduced for optimising the design of parallel concatenated codes and it was shown that good constituent codes are those that have the maximum possible effective free distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. The effective free distance can be defined as the lowest-weight codeword having the lowest for any weight-2 message <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref> a list of the best low-complexity constituent codes were presented based on maximising the effective free distance.</p><p>On the other hand, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> that the design of the constituent codes of turbo codes relying on iterative decoding based on the effective free distance substantially affects the code's performance in the error-floor region, whilst having only a modest effect on the convergence properties of the code and on its performance in the turbo cliff region. These statements may be readily confirmed with the aid of EXIT charts. Additionally, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> that there is a difference between the codes designed according to the noniterative Maximum Likelihood (ML) design criterion and those designed according to the iterative decoding criterion. For ML decoding, the design criterion is to maximise the effective free distance, while the design criterion for iterative decoding using EXIT charts is to find the lowest turbo cliff SNR. Hence, it was concluded in <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> that a trade-off has to be struck between both design criteria for the sake of designing good codes. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> non-systematic turbo codes were designed, where the effective free distance was maximised in order to provide a better error floor performance and the EXIT charts were utilised for improving the turbo-cliff performance of the proposed non-systematic turbo codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Further EXIT Chart Applications</head><p>EXIT charts constitute a powerful semi-analytical tool that may be used for analysing any system, where there is an exchange of information. In a practical system relying on realistic channel estimation and synchronisation, the errors due to channel estimation and synchronisation imperfections may also be considered as an additional source of noise, hence the EXIT chart analysis may provide us with an indication of the degradation due to realistic imperfect channel estimation and synchronisation, without the need to embark on the timeconsuming Monte-Carlo simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, in a multi-user system supporting N users <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120]</ref>, where Multi-User Detection (MUD) is employed at the receiver, the EXIT charts have to be (N + 1)dimensional to analyse such a system, which makes its employment infeasible. In this case, we may assume however that all transmitters have the same transmission power. Then, an average EXIT chart can be adopted for the entire system in order to arrive at an indication of the average system performance, while varying the number of users, for example. Furthermore, it may be argued that EXIT charts can be used for estimating the complexity of an iteratively decoded system by predicting the number of iterations required for attaining the target BER performance.</p><p>Additionally, based on the EXIT-curve matching technique of IrCCs, Irregular Variable Length Coding (IrVLC) was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> for near-capacity joint source and channel coding. In IrVLC a number of component Variable Length Coding (VLC) codebooks having different coding rates encode specific fractions of the input source symbol stream. EXIT charts are used for appropriately selecting these fractions to shape the IrVLC EXIT curve in order to match that of the inner decoder, which allows for near-capacity performance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> an IrVLC was amalgamated with TCM, where iterative decoding was employed at the receiver for exchanging extrinsic information between the IrVLC and TCM decoders. On the other hand, an IrVLC was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> combined with a Time Hopping (TH) Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)aided Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) Spread Spectrum (SS) impulse radio system. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> the TH PPM-aided UWB SS system was amalgamated with a URC in conjunction with the lossless IrVLC <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> joint source and channel coding in order to attain near-capacity performance. Additionally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref> iterative decoding of the IrVLC scheme concatenated with precoded Fast Frequency Hopping (FFH) M-ary Frequency Shift Keying (MFSK) was considered. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref> that using the proposed scheme, an infinitesimally low BER may be achieved at low SNR values.</p><p>On the other hand, the EXIT chart matching technique was invoked for designing serially concatenated inner and outer codes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> the inner code used was a URC, while the outer code was a VLC, where the irregular design was constituted by a variety of the inner and outer component codes and EXIT chart matching was used for minimising the area of the open EXIT tunnel between the inner and outer codes' EXIT curves. Hence, this facilitates operation at E b /N 0 values that are closer to the channel's capacity bound. Additionally, another irregular design based on EXIT charts was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>, where a near-capacity Irregular BICM-ID (Ir-BICM-ID) scheme was proposed. The irregular design of the scheme uses the three components of BICM-ID, namely the encoder, the URC and the bit-to-symbol mapper. The proposed system was capable of approaching the capacity of coded modulation.</p><p>Furthermore, a capacity-approaching cooperative spacetime coding scheme employing irregular design for a twinrelay aided network was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>, where a successive relaying protocol was employed for the sake of recovering the multiplexing loss imposed by a half-duplex three-terminal network. Additionally, near-capacity coding was employed by the proposed system, where the cooperative space-time codes used at the source and the relays were jointly designed with the aid of EXIT charts for attaining a near-relayingchannel-capacity performance. As a further advance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref> an Irregular Distributed Space-Time (Ir-DST) coding scheme designed for near-capacity cooperative communications was presented. The proposed system's effective throughput was maximised with the aid of a joint source-and-relay mode design procedure. In the system presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>, an IrCC was serially concatenated with a URC and a STBC at the source node for the sake of approaching the corresponding source-to-relay link capacity. EXIT charts were used for optimising the IrCC. On the other hand, another IrCC was serially concatenated with an identical STBC at the relay node. The relay's IrCC was re-optimised using EXIT charts for the sake of approaching the relay channel's capacity and also to maximise the relay's coding rate, hence maximising the effective throughput. At the destination node, a threestage iterative decoding scheme was constructed for achieving decoding convergence to an infinitesimally low BER.</p><p>Since the introduction of turbo-code-aided Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) schemes, research focused on their complexity reduction. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>, an early stopping strategy was proposed for a turbo HARQ scheme, which results in significant complexity reduction, while maintaining a high throughput. Further improvements were also proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>, where a new Deferred Iterations (DI) strategy was designed to take into account the prevalent channel conditions. More explicitly, the proposed DI strategy delays the commencement of the turbo-decoding until an open EXIT chart tunnel appears, leading to a successful decoding operation.</p></div>

DESIGN GUIDELINES</head><p>In the age of smart phones and tablet PCs, the main driving force behind the advances in wireless communications is the promise of seamless global mobility and flawless high-rate wireless multimedia services. This is required, while meeting a range of contradicting design challenges such as those included in the illustration of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">44</ref>. For example, it is possible to both increase the effective throughput and simultaneously to reduce the BER, if an increased implementation complexity and a higher power consumption may be tolerated to facilitate more sophisticated signal processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In the following we will focus on the design of channel coding utilising the EXIT chart analysis tool, while reflecting on the design trade-offs of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">44</ref>. Considering a given coding rate, we focus on the following design trade-offs: BER, coding gain, interleaving delay and complexity in terms of the number of decoding iterations. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">45</ref> shows the achievable BER of the RSC-coded and URC-precoded scheme of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> for a variable number of decoding iterations and a variable interleaver length at E b /N 0 of 3.6 dB. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">45</ref>, one more iteration is necessitated by the system employing an interleaver length of 100, 000 bits in order to achieve the same BER as that of the system employing an interleaver of length 800, 000 bits. Furthermore, the systems using interleaver lengths of 1, 000 and 10, 000 bits acquire little to no gain upon increasing the number of iterations at E b /N 0 of 3.6 dB. Relating this to the design factors of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">44</ref>, it is shown that increasing the complexity in terms of the number of decoding iterations as well as increasing the interleaver delay, it is possible to attain an improved BER performance.</p><p>The results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">45</ref> can be related to the EXIT charts and decoding trajectories of Figs. <ref type="bibr">28, 29, 30 and 31.</ref> It has been shown in Section III-D that when sufficiently long interleavers are used, the decoding trajectory can reach the (1.0,1.0) point of perfect decoding convergence to a vanishingly low BER.</p><p>Furthermore, it has been mentioned in Section III-B2 that two different methods can be used for evaluating the MI. One of the methods computes the MI by evaluating the histogram based approximation of p E <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> and then applying Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">13</ref>) or alternatively by using the time averaging method <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> of Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">15</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. The histogram-based and the averaging methods stipulate different assumptions, as described in Section III-A, although they both assume that the '0's and '1's of the encoder input bit sequence are equiprobable. When the LLRs satisfy the consistency condition, then the averaging method gives more accurate results as compared to the histogram-based method, which on the other hand works better when using long interleavers. The consistency condition is normally satisfied when all the component in the system are optimal and are using no approximation such as the MAP or Log-MAG algorithms. This does not mean that the two methods will result in different EXIT curves. The two methods can be used to verify that the design is sound by making sure that the EXIT curves using the two methods are matching.</p><p>It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref> that when employing non-optimal decoders relying on several approximations, the EXIT curve of the inner URC decoder does not reach the (1.0,1.0) point, although the URC uses a recursive encoder. It was also shown that even if the LLRs of the decoders are clipped QPSK GM URC, RSC(2,1,3) 3.6 dB 1,000 bits 10,000 bits 100,000 bits 800,000 bits Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">45</ref>. Achievable BER of the RSC-coded and URC-precoded scheme of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">24</ref> in combination with the outer RSC(2,1,3) and operating for at E b /N 0 of 3.6 dB with different interleaver lengths and number of iterations at a maximum value, in order to eliminate any chance for them to saturate, this does not result in the correct EXIT curve for the LLRs satisfying the consistency condition. It was concluded in <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref> that this phenomenon was due to the assumption used in the demapper and decoders namely that the data was Gaussian distributed, even though this assumption was inaccurate. Therefore, a LLR pre-processing technique was proposed in order to have LLRs output by the demapper satisfying the consistency condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In order for any communications system to attain a low BER at SNRs close to the channel capacity, it is essential to invoke channel coding and iterative decoding. Iterative decoding can be done for parallel as well as serially concatenated systems. Substantial efforts have been invested in optimising the performance of concatenated codes in order to improve the slopes of their BER curves and to attain a near-capacity performance. Recently, significant efforts have also been dedicated to studying the convergence behaviour of iterative decoding. EXIT charts were proposed as a powerful semi-analytical tools devised for analysing the convergence behaviour of iteratively decoded systems, where MI between the data bits at the transmitter and the soft values at the receiver were used for describing the exchange of extrinsic information between the constituent decoders.</p><p>The main objective of employing EXIT charts is to predict the convergence behaviour of iterative decoding by analysing the evolution of the MI exchange between the constituent decoders in consecutive iterations. In this paper, we have shown how the EXIT charts can be used for analysing and designing iteratively decoded systems using two-stage and three-stage iteratively decoded serially concatenated systems as design examples. The EXIT chart properties can be summarised as follows:</p><p>â¢ Ideally, in order for the exchange of extrinsic information between the inner and the outer decoders to converge for the sake of achieving a vanishingly low BER at a specific E b /N 0 value, the EXIT curve of the inner decoder recorded at the E b /N 0 value of interest and that of the outer RSC decoder should not intersect before reaching the (1.0, 1.0) point. â¢ This implies that given I a = 1.0, we have I e = 1.0 and provided that this condition is satisfied, an open convergence tunnel appears in the EXIT chart. The narrower the tunnel, the more iterations are required for reaching the (1.0, 1.0) point and the closer the BER curve approaches the vertical line representing the channel capacity. â¢ If however, the two extrinsic MI transfer characteristics intersect at a point close to the vertical line at I i,a = 1.0 rather than at the (1.0, 1.0) pointthen a low BER may still be achieved, although it will remain higher than the BER of the schemes having an intersection at the (1.0, 1.0) point. These types of EXIT tunnels are referred to here as semi-convergent tunnels. â¢ The EXIT chart based decoding convergence predictions are usually verified by the Monte-Carlo simulation based iterative decoding trajectory as detailed in Section III-B4. â¢ In order for the EXIT charts of the inner and outer decoders to intersect at the (1.0, 1.0) point, a recursive inner decoder component is needed for maximising the interleaver gain and for avoiding the formation of a BER floor. This can be achieved by employing a URC, which has an IIR and hence it efficiently randomises the extrinsic information without increasing the interleaver delay and without reducing the throughput. â¢ The application of EXIT charts is based on two assumptions, namely on having a high interleaver length, which ensures that the a priori LLR values are fairly uncorrelated and the probability density function of the a priori LLR values is Gaussian. It has been shown in Section III-D that when using short interleavers, these two assumptions become less accurate. This implies that the EXIT chart prediction of having an open tunnel and hence a low BER at the specific E b /N 0 is no longer valid. â¢ EXIT charts can also be used for predicting the convergence behaviour of three-stage iteratively decoded systems. In this case, 3D EXIT charts are generated, where 2D EXIT charts can be generated by projecting the intersection between the 3D EXIT curves of the "inner and intermediate" or the "intermediate and outer" decoder onto a 2D EXIT chart with the outer or inner decoder EXIT charts, respectively. â¢ The maximum achievable throughput of a system is equal to the area under the EXIT curve of the inner decoder as detailed in Section IV.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the input bit stream u 1 is encoded in Encoder 1 and an interleaved version of the input bit stream</figDesc></figure>
