<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION AND DISCUSSION</head><p>One of the important problems in the field of nonlinear control is global stabilization by output feedback. Unlike in the case of linear systems, global stabilizability by state feedback plus observability do not imply global stabilizability by output feedback, and therefore, the so-called separation principle usually does not hold for nonlinear systems. Perhaps for this reason, the problem is exceptionally challenging and much more difficult than the global stabilization by state feedback. Over the years, several papers have investigated global stabilization of nonlinear systems using output feedback and obtained some interesting results. For example, for a class of detectable bilinear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> or affine and nonaffine systems with stable-free dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, global stabilization via output feedback was proved to be solvable using the input saturation technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, a necessary and sufficient condition was given for a nonlinear system to be equivalent to an observable linear system perturbed by a vector field that depends only on the output and input of the system. As a consequence, global stabilization by output feedback is achievable for a class of nonlinear systems that are diffeomorphic to a system in the nonlinear observer form <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, counterexamples were given indicating that global stabilization of minimum-phase nonlinear systems via output feedback is usually impossible, without introducing extra growth conditions on the unmeasurable states of the system. Since then, much subsequent research work has been focused on the output feedback stabilization of nonlinear systems under various structural or growth conditions. One of the common assumptions is that nonlinear systems should be in an output feedback form <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or a triangular form with certain growth conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The other condition is that the system can nonlinearly depend on the output of the system but is linear in the unmeasurable states <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The latter was relaxed recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> by only imposing the global Lipschitz-like condition on the unmeasurable states.</p><p>In this note, we consider a class of single-input-single-output (SISO) time-varying systems</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">_ x 1 = x 2 + 1 (t; x; u) _ x 2 = x 3 + 2 (t; x; u) . . . _ x n = u + n (t; x; u) y = x1 (1.1)</formula><p>where x = (x 1 ; . . . ; x n ) T 2 IR n , u 2 IR and y 2 IR are the system state, input, and output, respectively. The mappings i: IR2IR n 2I R ! IR, i = 1; . . . ; n, are continuous and satisfy the following condition.</p><p>Assumption 1.1: For i = 1; . . . ; n, there is a constant c 0 such that j i (t; x; u)j c(jx 1 j + 111 + jx i j):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(1.2)</formula><p>Under this hypothesis, it has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> that global exponential stabilization of nonlinear systems (1.1) is possible using linear state feedback. The objective of this note is to prove that the same growth condition, namely Assumption 1.1, guarantees the existence of a linear output dynamic compensator</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">_ = M + N y; M 2 IR n2n ; N 2 IR n u = K; K 2 IR 12n (1.3)</formula><p>such that the closed-loop system (1.1)-(1.3) is globally exponentially stable (GES) at the equilibrium (x; ) = (0; 0).</p><p>It must be pointed out that systems (1.1) satisfying Assumption 1.1 represent an important class of nonlinear systems that cannot be dealt with by existing output feedback control schemes such as those reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. To make this point clearer, in what follows we examine three seemingly simple but nontrivial examples. The first example is a planar system of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">_ x 1 = x 2 + ln(1 + u 2 x 2 1 x 2 2 ) 1 + u 2 x 2 2 _ x 2 = u + x 2 (1 0 cos(x 2 u)) y = x1</formula><p>(1.4) which obviously satisfies Assumption 1.1. However, it is not in an output feedback form (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) nor satisfies the structural or growth conditions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Therefore, global stabilization of the planar system <ref type="bibr">(1.4)</ref>  (1.5) may fail to satisfy the global Lipschitz-like condition given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, global stabilization of (1.5) via output feedback cannot be solved by the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In fact, it is easy to verify that x 2 sin x 2 is not global Lipschitz with respect to the unmeasurable state x2, although Assumption 1.1 holds. For this type of nonlinear systems, most of the existing results on output feedback stabilization are not applicable and a "Luenberger-type" observer, which consists of a copy of (1.5) plus an error correction term, does not seem to work because convergence of the error dynamics is hard to prove. Finally, in the case when the system under consideration involves parametric uncertainty, the problem of output feedback stabilization becomes even more challenging. Few results are available in the literature dealing with nonlinear systems with uncertainty that is associated with the unmeasurable states. For instance, consider the uncertain system</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">_ x 1 = x 2 + d 1 (t)x 1 _ x2 = u + d2(t) ln(1 + x 4 2 ) sin x2 y = x 1 (1.6)</formula><p>which satisfies Assumption 1.1, where jdi(t)j 1, i = 1; 2, are unknown continuous functions with known bounds (equal to one in the present case). When d 2 (t) 0, global stabilization of the uncertain system (1.6) can be easily solved using output feedback. However, when d 2 (t) 6 = 0, all the existing methods cannot be used because the presence of d 2 (t) makes the design of a nonlinear observer extremely difficult.</p><p>The examples discussed thus far have indicated that nonlinear systems (1.1) with Assumption 1.1 cover a class of nonlinear systems whose global stabilization by output feedback does not seem to be solvable by any existing design method, and therefore is worth of investigation. The main contribution of the note is the development of a feedback domination design approach that enables one to explicitly construct a linear dynamic output compensator (1.3), globally exponentially stabilizing the entire family of nonlinear systems (1.1) under the growth condition (1.2). It must be pointed out that our output feedback control scheme is not based on the separation principle. That is, instead of constructing the observer and controller separately, we couple the high-gain linear observer design together with the controller construction. An obvious advantage of our design method is that the precise knowledge of the nonlinearities or uncertainties of the systems needs not to be known. What really needed is the information of the bounding function of the uncertainties, i.e., the constant c in (1.2). This feature makes it possible to stabilize a family of nonlinear systems using a single output feedback compensator. In other words, the proposed output feedback controller has a "universal" property. In the case of cascade systems, our design method can deal with an entire family of finite-dimensional minimum-phase nonlinear systems whose dimensions of the zero-dynamics are unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. OUTPUT FEEDBACK DESIGN</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, it was proved that a class of nonlinear systems satisfying Assumption 1.1 is globally exponentially stabilizable by linear state feedback. When dealing with the problem of global stabilization via output feedback, stronger conditions such as lower-triangular structure, differentiability of the vector field (t; x; u) = ( 1 (1); . . . ; 1 (1)) T   and the global Lipschitz condition were assumed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In this section, we prove that Assumption 1.1 suffices to guarantee the existence of a globally stabilizing output feedback controller. This is done by using a feedback domination design which explicitly constructs a linear output feedback control law. In contrast to the nonlinear output feedback controller obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the dynamic output compensator we propose is linear with a simple structure (1.3).</p><p>Theorem 2.1: Under Assumption 1.1, there exists a linear output feedback controller (1.3) making the uncertain nonlinear system (1.1) globally exponentially stable.</p><p>Proof: The proof consists of two parts. First of all, we design a linear high-gain observer motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, without using the information of the system nonlinearities, i.e., i(t; x; u); i = 1; . . . ; n:</p><p>This results in an error dynamics containing some extra terms that prevent convergence of the high-gain observer. We then construct an output controller based on a feedback domination design to take care of the extra terms arising from the observer design. This is accomplished by choosing, step-by-step, the gain parameters of the observer and the virtual controllers in a delicate manner. At the last step, a linear output dynamic compensator can be obtained, making the closed-loop system globally exponentially stable.</p></div>

Therefore, the closed-loop system is globally exponentially stable. Remark 2.2: The novelty of Theorem 2.1 is two-fold: on one hand, in contrast to the common observer design that usually uses a copy of (1.1), we design only a linear observer (2.1) for the uncertain nonlinear system (1.1). Such a construction, under Assumption 1.1, avoids dealing with difficult issues caused by the uncertainties or nonlinearities of the system. On the other hand, the gain parameter L of the observer (2.1) is designed in such a way that it depends on the parameters of the controller [i.e., bi; i = 1; . . . ; n, in (2.10)]. In fact, the observer and controller designs in Theorem 2.1 are heavily coupled with each other. This is substantially different from most of the existing work where the designed observer itself can asymptotically recover the state of the controlled plant, regardless of the design of the controller, i.e., the controller design is independent of the observer design-known as the separation principle.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">V n ("; 1 ; . . . ; n ) = V 0 (") + n i=1 1 2L 2(i01)</formula><p>Theorem 2.1 has an interesting consequence on output feedback stabilization of a family of time-varying nonlinear systems in the form  (2.12)</p><p>where a i; j (t; y), k = 1; . . . ; i, i = 1; . . . ; n, are unknown continuous functions uniformly bounded by a known constant. Obviously, Assumption 1.1 holds for (2.12). Thus, we have the following result. Corollary 2.3: For the uncertain time-varying nonlinear system (2.12), there is a linear dynamic output compensator <ref type="bibr">(1.3)</ref>, such that the closed-loop system (2.12) and (1.3) is globally exponentially stable.</p><p>Note that this corollary has recovered the output feedback stabilization theorem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, for the time-invariant triangular system with globally bounded a i; j (y)'s (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>).</p><p>In the rest of this section, we use examples to illustrate applications of Theorem 2.1.</p><p>Example 2.4: Consider a continuous but nonsmooth planar system of the form  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is fulfilled.

On the other hand, (2.14) is globally exponentially stabilizable by the linear output feedback controller (2.1)-(2.10) as Assumption 1.1 is obviously satisfied. Example 2.6: Consider a single-link robot arm system introduced, for instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The state-space model is described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">_ z 1 = z 2 _ z 2 = K J 2 N z 3 0 F 2 (t) J 2 z 2 0 K J 2 z 1 0 mgd J 2 cos z 1 _ z3 = z4 _ z 4 = 1 J 1 u + K J 1 N z 1 0 K J 2 N z 3 0 F 1 (t) J 1 z 4 y = z1</formula><p>(2.17)</p><p>where J 1 ; J 2 ; K; N; m; g; d are known parameters, and F 1 (t) and F 2 (t) are viscous friction coefficients that may vary continuously with time.

The control objective is to globally stabilize the equilibrium (z 1 ; z 2 ; z 3 ; z 4 ) = (0; 0; mgdN=K; 0) by measurement feedback. In the current case, z1-the link displacement of the system is measurable and, therefore, can be used for feedback design. To solve the problem, we introduce a change of coordinates</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">x1 = z1; x2 = z2; x3 = K J 2 N z3 0 mgd J 2 ; x4 = K J 2 N z4 and a prefeedback v = K J 2 N 1 J 1 u 0 mgd J 2 to transform (2.17) into _ x1 = x2 _ x 2 = x 3 0 F 2 (t) J 2</formula><p>x 2 0 K J 2</p><p>x 1 0 mgd J 2</p><p>(cos x 1 0 1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">_ x3 = x4 _ x4 = v + K 2 J 1 J 2 N 2 x1 0 K J 2 N x3 0 F1(t)</formula><p>J 1 x4 y = x 1 :</p><p>(2.18)</p><p>Since F 1 (t) and F 2 (t) are unknown, most of the existing results are not applicable to the output feedback stabilization problem of (2.18).</p><p>Observe that Assumption 1.1 holds for (2.18) because j cos x 1 0 1j jx 1 j F2(t) J2</p><p>x 2 c 1 jx 2 j F 1 (t) J 1 x4 c2jx4j; for constants c1; c2:</p><p>Using Theorem 2.1, it is easy to construct a linear dynamic output compensator of the form (2.1)-(2.10), solving the global stabilization problem for (2.18). We end this section by pointing out when Assumption 1.1 fails to be satisfied, global stabilization of (1.1) by output feedback may be impossible. For instance, the nonlinear system _ x 1 =x 2 _ x 2 =x 3 _ x 3 =u + x 2 3 y =x 1 is not globally stabilizable by any continuous dynamic output compensator. This fact can be proved using an argument similar to the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>

UNIVERSAL OUTPUT FEEDBACK STABILIZATION</head><p>From the design procedure of Theorem 2.1, it is clear that there is a single linear output feedback controller (1.3) making the entire family of nonlinear systems (1.1) simultaneously exponentially stable, as long as they satisfy Assumption 1.1 with the same bound c.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have presented a new output feedback control scheme for a class of nonlinear systems whose global stabilization problem via output feedback cannot be handled by existing methods. The proposed output dynamic compensator is linear and can stabilize simultaneously a family of nonlinear systems which are dominated by a chain of integrators perturbed by a triangular vector field with linear growth condition. Moreover, the result can also be applied to a finite number of globally exponentially minimum-phase systems (say, for instance, m controlled plants), in which the dimensions of the zero dynamics can be different and unknown.</p></div>			</div>
