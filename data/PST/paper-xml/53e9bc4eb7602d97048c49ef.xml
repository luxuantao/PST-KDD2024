<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose to combine a triangular element surface model with a linearized reflectance map to formulate the shape-from-shading problem. The main idea is to approximate a smooth surface by the union of triangular surface patches called triangular elements and express the approximating surface as a linear combination of a set of nodal basis functions. Since the surface normal of a triangular element is uniquely determined by heights of its t h m vertices (or nodes), image brightness can be directly related to nodal heights via the linearized reflectance map. The surface height can then be determined by minimizing a quadratic cost functional corresponding to the squares of brightness errors and solved effectively with the multigrid computational technique. The proposed method does not require any integrability constraint or artificial assumptions on boundary conditions. Simulation results for synthetic and real images are demonstrated to show the performance and efficiency of our new method.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>The recursive optimal four-way split and the RAG-guided minimum cost merge were proposed to improve the validity of the classic split-and-merge segmentation algorithm. The new optimized splitand-merge algorithm achieves the unification of edge detection and segmentation within a tree hierarchy. As a result of this data structure and a statistic preprocessing, the optimization can be done without increasing the time complexity order of the previous algorithms.</p><p>The success of the adaptive four-way split naturally leads to the following question: Why should we not consider every orientation when we optimize the split to capture edges of arbitrary orientations? This is a matter of compromise between computational costs and the optimality. Although adaptive four-way cuts greatly improve the segmentation validity over regular rectilinear cuts, they still have relatively simple digital geometry and manageable computational cost. The same cannot be said when, say, eight different cutting directions are considered in the optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The shape-from-shading (SFS) problem extracts 3-D shape information from one or multiple 2-D shading images and can be viewed as an inversion problem of image formation. It was first formulated Manuscript recieved March 1, 1991; revised <ref type="bibr">March 2, 1992.</ref>  Most research work on SFS with a single image uses the variational approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, [lo], 1121, 1171, 1241 in which a surface orientation field characterized by its slopes p ( x . I / ] = a:(.?. .yl/a.r and q(.r. y ) = a:(.,.. y)/a.y is determined by minimizing a cost functional of brightness errors. To achieve the objective, one applies the calculus of variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> to the functional to derive a set of coupled Euler equations involving p(.r. ,I/) and q ( . r . y ) . However, a straightforward implementation of this approach does not work properly due to the nonintegrability of computed p ( .r. g 1 and q ( .r. q ) and the ill-posed nature of the problem. Methods for enforcing integrability have been studied by Frankot and Chellappa <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> and Horn (91. The ill-posedness of SFS is often handled by regularization <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, (121, 1221.</p><p>Since the variational approach leads to complicated first-order nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE's), modified SFS algorithms still have two major difficulties. First, appropriate boundary conditions are needed for PDE solution. N o boundary conditions result in the ambiguity of the solution and the instability of the numerical algorithm [Y]. Second, nonlinear PDE's are solved by iterative algorithms whose convergence property is, however, not yet well understood [Y], <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. The number of iterations of converging algorithms often grows linearly with image size .\- [Y]   so that computational complexity is proportional to O ( .1-2). which is too high to be useful in real-time applications.</p><p>A very different approach for SFS was recently proposed by Pentland <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. It relates image brightness to surface height : ( . I ' . y ) in closed form with a linearized reflectance map in the Fourier transform domain. The resulting algorithm is a nonoptimization and noniterative one. Since surface height :(.r. .I/], rather than its slopes p ( . r . y ) and y(.r. .I/ ), is computed directly from the algorithm, no integrability problem appears. However, the reconstructed surface by this approach is less accurate than that obtained by the variational approach since it is a one-step algorithm using only the global linearization of the reflectance map around the origin. Other shortcomings of the approach include that known physical information cannot be easily incorporated in the formulation and that it is sensitive to the noise.</p><p>We propose a new approach to SFS in this research, The basic idea of our approach is to approximate a smooth surface by the union of triangular surface patches called triangular elements and express the approximating surface as a linear combination of a set of nodal basis functions of compact support. Since the surface normal of a triangular element is linearly determined by heights of its three vertices (or nodes), we can relate image brightness directly to nodal heights via the reflectance map. Furthermore, image brightness is an affine function of nodal heights if the reflectance map is linearized. By defining the cost functional to be the squares of brightness errors, we are led to a quadratic functional minimization problem parameterized by nodal heights. Our approach has several unique features. First, it does not need any integrability constraint since the height is computed directly. Second, boundary conditions are not needed in the solution process since it solves a discrete minimization problem rather than discretized PDE's. Third, since the cost functional is greatly simplified to be a quadratic form. it is much easier to analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution and to search effective convergent iterative algorithms. Besides, the optimization problem can be transformed into the solution of a large sparse linear system of equations, and very efficient multigrid (MG) computational algorithm can be conveniently applied. The number of iterations for the MG algorithm is independent of image size -1-so that its computational complexity is only 0 ( -1-I.</p><p>To use height values directly as variables in SFS has been con- sidered by several researchers. In [Y], Horn used both the height and gradients as variables so that the height was recovered directly without integration. However, boundary conditions were still needed for PDE solution in his work. It is also worthwhile to point out a very recent work by <ref type="bibr">Leclerc and Bobick [15]</ref>, which recovered heights directly using a discrete minimization formulation. Their idea is similar to ours except that they did not use an explicit surface model. Instead, the horizontal and vertical central differences of the height : ( . r . y ) were used to approximate the gradients p and q . Besides, no linearization of the reflectance map was made, and the corresponding nonlinear cost functional was solved by the conjugate gradient method.</p></div>

Triangular Element Surface Model</head><p>A smooth surface can be approximated by a union of triangular surface patches and expressed as a linear combination of nodal basis functions with compact support known as the finite triangular elements [13], 1231.

Reflectance Map Image Formation Model</head><p>Under the assumption of the orthographic projection, the Lambertian surface, and a distant single point light source, the irradiance or brightness E at a given point (r. y ) is primarily due to the surface orientation at that point. This relationship is described by the image irradiance equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, [ 111 where R is called the reflectance map function. The form of R is usually chosen as <ref type="bibr">(2.6a)</ref> or equivalently Ii = -p cos T sin uq sin T sin u + cos U <ref type="bibr">(2.6b)</ref> where is the albedo of the surface, ( p , q ) the gradient of the surface at point (I.

Otherwise, go to the next iteration.</p><p>In the above algorithm, we use a successive linearization scheme, where the linearization of the reflectance map is performed based on the local gradients obtained from the previous iteration. The motivation is simple. There are two kinds of error introduced in our SFS formulation: the surface approximation error introduced by the triangular element model and the reflectance map approximation error due to linearization. The first kind of error depends on the spacing 11 and can be reduced by using smaller spacings. The second kind of error can be reduced by approximating the reflectance map to the original nonlinear one as close as possible. Since the coefficients Q ~ and ~j ( are functions of local reference gradients (PO,. yot ), the choice of ( p u g . qoZ ) is important. To determine appropriate local reference gradients, we need good surface information. By doing the successive linearization, we can get increasingly accurate surface gradients and surface values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Iv. SINGULARITIES OF STIFFNESS MATRICES</head><p>The stiffness matrix A is sparse since each nodal basis function a , (.r. y ) has a compact support and overlaps with only a finite number ( 5 G ) of neighboring nodal basis functions. It is evident from (2.12) that o , . ~ : n,,, so that A is symmetric. Besides, for any nonzero vector z, we have so that A is positive semidefinite. However, A is singular, and consequently, the cost functional given in (2.11) does not have a unique minimum. In this section, we will investigate the reasons (or physical interpretations) for the singularity of A and discuss ways to remove it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Stifiess Matrix with Global Linearization</head><p>One reason for A, to be singular can be explained by the wellknown fact that we cannot determine the absolute heights of the object surface from the image plane since the brightness of a surface patch is only determined by its gradient. According to Table <ref type="table">11</ref>, it is easy to verify that the row sum of A, is zero for every row. Let U be the vector of l's, i.e., U = [l. 1.. ... 11'. We have A,u = 0.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Therefore, if A , z * = b A,(z* + cu) = b (4.2)</formula><p>where e is an arbitrary constant. This singularity is clearly the inherent limitation of the SFS problem. However, it can be removed by introducing an arbitrary reference nodal point.</p><p>Another reason for A, to be singular can be understood by considering a single triangular patch. Suppose that one node is chosen to be the reference. There are still two nodal heights to be determined.</p><p>Since the image irradiance equation R ( p . q ) = E , where E is the average brightness on the patch, only provides one constraint, the two equations consisting of these two relative nodal heights have to be linearly dependent. Hence, we conclude that the global stiffness matrix A, has a null space of dimension of at least two.</p><p>The singularity of A, may also be resulted from special values of 0 and ,j, that is, if n = 0, ,j = 0, or (1 = j, we are not able to relate the gradient of a surface patch to its image intensity via (2.Y).</p><p>To see this, let us consider the triangular surfaces S A . ' . . S, over the triangular domains T A . . . . . T, as specified in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. If ( I = 0 (or 3 = O), the image intensities of surfaces SA and S,, (or SI and S o ) are independent of p (or y) and, thus, the nodal height :,. This phenomenon can also be explained by using Table <ref type="table">11</ref>. Note that It follows that if (1 = J, the image intensities of surfaces S,,, and S, cannot be used to determine the nodal height :,.</p><p>Motivated by the previous discussion, the sufficient conditions for the quadratic cost functional (2.11) to have a unique minimum can be stated as follows.</p><p>Theorem 1: The quadratic functional (2.11) with A = A,, has a unique minimum if the following two conditions are satisfied.</p><p>1. There are two neighboring nodal points whose heights are given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>(1 # 0, , j # 0, and (1 # j.</p><p>Proof: Without loss of generality, it is assumed that we know the two nodal heights of the triangular surface S 1 over the domain T I , as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. If 31 and -4 are given since (1 # 0, we can use the linearized reflectance map and the image irradiance equation to determine the value of -5 . Similarly, we can argue that -1 (or 34) can be obtained from given : . I and -5 (or and L~). In turn, the nodal heights of adjacent triangular surface patches S2.5,; can be determined since they share two common nodes with SI. Thus, by this manner, all nodal values z r can be uniquely determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>0</head><p>In practice, to achieve the first condition, we may simply select two neighboring nodal points in an estimated plane region as the zero reference points. Since r i and ,j are functions of the reference gradient ( p o . yo), the second condition can be satisfied by choosing a proper value of ( P O . yo ). To give an example, consider the reflectance map <ref type="bibr">(2.6)</ref> with the illumination direction ( p S . q s . 1) and ( p 0 . c l 0 ) = (0.0). It is straightforward to see that the second condition is satisfied except p 9 = 0, q . = 0, or 11. = (I.. If the illumination direction happens to be these cases, we may move the reference gradient slightly around the origin so that the second condition is still satisfied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Stiffness Matrix with Local Linearization</head><p>For general stiffness matrix A, we can also state the sufficient conditions for the quadratic cost functional (2.11) to have a unique minimum as follows.</p><p>Theorem 2: The quadratic functional (2.11) has a unique minimum if the following two conditions are satisfied.</p><p>1. There are two neighboring nodal points whose heights are given.</p><p>2. n , # 0. , j 9 # 0 and n t # J, for the linearized reflectance map defined on every domain T,.</p><p>Its proof is omitted since it is very similar to that of Theorem 1. Note that these conditions are not necessary but are sufficient. For example, (2.11) may have a unique minimum even if the second condition is not satisfied. As before, the first condition can be satisfied by selecting two neighboring nodes in an estimated plane region as the zero reference points. To attain the second condition, one possibility is to consider the selection of a proper reference gradient for each triangle patch. This can be achieved by checking the values of a,, Jt and perturbing the reference point slightly whenever it is necessary. Another possibility is to introduce a regularization method to ensure the well poseness of the SFS problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>v. REGULARIZATION WITH SMOOTH SURFACE CONSTRAINT</head><p>Regularization is often achieved by adding some terms to the cost functional so that the regularized problem is well posed <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>. It is preferable that we associate the additional term with some physical interpretation. As discussed in Section IV, the nonuniqueness of the minimum of the quadratic functional (2.11) is primarily due to some free nodal variables that may have arbitrary values without affecting the cost functional. Therefore, to obtain a unique solution, we have to restrict these free variables by some constraint, say, the smoothness surface constraint, so that each node is related to its neighboring nodes through other means. Another reason to impose the smoothness constraint is to make our algorithm less sensitive to noises such as the sensor noise, the quantization noise, and the imperfect reflectance map model for real images.</p><p>To impose the smooth surface constraint, we define a new cost functional where : ' h is the original cost functional given by (2.11), and X is the smoothing factor.

Let us rewrite Z'CZ as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Z'CZ = z T ( ~ + X B ~Z =z' Az + Xz' Bz.</formula><p>Note that for nonzero A, the above equation is zero only when both z T A z and z'Bz are zero since each term represents nonnegative energy. Recall that z' B z is the discretized version of which becomes zero only when ~( s .</p><p>.y ) is a linear function over 0.</p><p>Hence, z7 B z is zero only when ( U . y ) is constant over the whole domain R. On the other hand, from (2.8) and (4.1), we know that the term zTAz is zero only when 1 ; : ; @t:t = 0 or, equivalently, ~k p k + , j k c l r = 0 for every triangular domain Tk.</p><p>Thus, Z'CZ is zero only when n k y + . j k y = 0 for every triangular domain TA with respect to some constant ( y . y ) . This implies all ( C I A . j t ) , 1 5 I; 5 -Iff are orthogonal to a certain ( p , q ) . Now, consider the case where two coefficients (nl. ,31) and ( 0 2 , &amp; ) are not linearly dependent. For z r C z to be zero, we have to require ( p . y ) = (0.0). In addition, if one nodal point is assigned with value 0 As discussed earlier, since only relative nodal heights have to be determined, we can pick an arbitrary point in reference to satisfy the first condition. The second condition usually holds in practice when we perform the local linearization of the reflectance map based on reconstructed surface obtained from the previous iteration. Therefore, the unique minimum of (5.5) can be easily guaranteed. Note that the conditions in Theorem 3 are sufficient but not necessary. For example, in the initialization stage of the successive linearization scheme described in Section 111, even though condition 2 in Theorem 3 does not satisfy, the unique minimum of (5.5) is still guaranteed by conditions of Theorem 1.</p><p>We incorporate the regularization into the basic SFS algorithm to obtain a modified SFS algorithm, which is the algorithm used in our experiments described in Section VI. If llzA -~"'11 &lt; F. where F is a predefined small quantity, then zh is the desired solution. Otherwise, go to the next iteration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>Our algorithm has been tested on several synthetic and real images. We use the global linearization scheme with respect to ( p . q ) = (0.0) at the first iteration and perform local linearizations successively at the following iterations. The reconstructed surface of the previous iteration serves as the initial estimate of the current iteration, and therefore, the number of multigrid V cycles required to reach a given error bound decreases as iteration proceeds. The resulting algorithm is very efficient computationally. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>, and 1151, we choose the smoothing factor X to be a certain small value at the first iteration and reduce the value gradually to near zero at following iterations.</p><p>To illustrate the quality of results, we present the 3-D surface plot of the reconstructed surface as well as three shaded views produced with three illuminating directions: the same, orthogonal, and opposite tilt directions with respect to the original lighting direction as suggested by Horn <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, (311. The error of the reconstructed surface is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(a), which is quite flat. To examine the error better, we present 1-D cross sections of heights in horizontal (parallel to the .I' axis) and vertical directions (parallel to the .y axis) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6(b)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(c)</ref>, where the solid and dotted lines represent the original and reconstructed values, respectively. Note that the reconstructed surface is more accurate along the horizontal (east-west) direction in parallel with the illuminating source and less accurate along the vertical (north-south) direction. The same phenomena were observed for all our test problems and were reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. Generally speaking, local fluctuations or ripples in parallel to the lighting direction occur in the reconstructed surface. They are particularly visible in the plane region.</p><p>It is worthwhile to point out that the phenomenon highly depends on the light source direction. Since different light sources result in different reflectance maps, it is possible to give an explanation by analyzing the property of reflectance maps. In [19], we perform a simple analysis of the reflectance map and show that the accuracy of reconstructed orientations or heights is closely related to the slope </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Problem 2: Lena</head><p>The tested image is the 25G x 2.56 Lena image as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>(a). This image consists of both smooth and rapid varying areas with discontinuities in the surface orientation. The 3-D plot of the reconstructed surface and its shaded views illuminated with light sources from the same, opposite, and orthogonal tilt directions are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>(b)-(e), respectively. This test problem is considered difficult since it contains several objects (possibly nonlambertian) with different reflectivities and shadows. Besides, the lighting condition is not ideal. However, with the assumption of homogeneous </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI]. CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented a new efficient algorithm for the SFS problem in this research. Our algorithm recovers surface heights directly without any additional integrability constraint or artificial boundary assumption. It is based on a linear approximation of the reflectance map and a triangular element surface model, in which we express a surface as a linear combination of nodal basis functions. The nodal heights are determined by minimizing the cost functional, which is the total brightness error parameterized by nodal heights. This is equivalent to solving a large sparse linear system to which the efficient multigrid method can be easily applied. We discussed the existence and uniqueness of the solution by investigating the properties of the stiffness matrix. A regularization technique using the smooth surface constraint was introduced to ensure the well poseness of the SFS problem. A successive linearization scheme was developed to obtain increasingly correct surface and gradient information. Another advantage of our algorithm is that it maps naturally onto massively parallel architectures where each process covers one or several nodes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
