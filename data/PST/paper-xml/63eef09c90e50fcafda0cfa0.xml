<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The ubiquitous Web is becoming the ultimate data repository, capable of linking a broad spectrum of objects to form gigantic and complex graphs. The prevalence of graph data enables a series of downstream tasks for Web applications, ranging from online page/article classification to friend recommendation in social networks. Modern approaches for graph analysis generally resort to graph representation learning including graph embedding and graph neural networks (GNNs). Earlier graph embedding approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> usually embed nodes on the graph into a low-dimensional space, in which the structural information such as the proximity between nodes can be captured <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. More recently, GNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> have emerged as the state of the art for graph representation learning. Their key idea boils down to a message-passing framework, in which each node derives its representation by receiving and aggregating messages from its neighboring nodes recursively <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Graph pre-training. Typically, GNNs work in an end-to-end manner, and their performance depends heavily on the availability of large-scale, task-specific labeled data as supervision. This supervised paradigm presents two problems. First, task-specific supervision is often difficult or costly to obtain. Second, to deal with a new task, the weights of GNN models need to be retrained from scratch, even if the task is on the same graph. To address these issues, pretraining GNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> have become increasingly popular, inspired by pre-training techniques in language and vision applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. The pre-training of GNNs leverages self-supervised learning on more readily available label-free graphs (i.e., graphs without task-specific labels), and learns intrinsic graph properties that intend to be general across tasks and graphs in a domain. In other words, the pre-training extracts a task-agnostic prior, and can be used to initialize model weights for a new task. Subsequently, the initial weights can be quickly updated through a lightweight fine-tuning step on a smaller number of task-specific labels.</p><p>However, the "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm suffers from the problem of inconsistent objectives between pre-training and downstream tasks, resulting in suboptimal performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. On one hand, the pre-training step aims to preserve various intrinsic graph properties such as node/edge features <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, node connectivity/links <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, and local/global patterns <ref type="bibr">[15, 30, 34, 54?</ref> ]. On the other hand, the fine-tuning step aims to reduce the task loss, i.e., to fit the ground truth of the downstream task. The discrepancy between the two steps can be quite large. For example, pre-training may focus on learning the connectivity pattern between two nodes (i.e., related to link prediction), whereas fine-tuning could be dealing with a node or graph property (i.e., node classification or graph classification task).</p><p>Prior work. To narrow the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks, prompting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> has first been proposed for language models, which is a natural language instruction designed for a specific downstream task to "prompt out" the semantic relevance between the task and the language model. Meanwhile, the parameters of the pre-trained language model are frozen without any fine-tuning, as the prompt can pull the task toward the pre-trained model. Thus, prompting is also more efficient than fine-tuning, especially when the pre-trained model is huge. Recently, prompting has also been introduced to graph pre-training in the GPPT approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. While the pioneering work has proposed a sophisticated design of pre-training and prompting, it can only be employed for the node classification task, lacking a universal treatment that appeals to different downstream tasks such as both node classification and graph classification.</p><p>Research problem and challenges. To address the divergence between graph pre-training and various downstream tasks, in this paper we investigate the design of pre-training and prompting for graph neural networks. In particular, we aim for a unified design that can suit different downstream tasks flexibly. This problem is non-trivial due to the following two challenges.</p><p>Firstly, to enable effective knowledge transfer from the pretraining to a downstream task, it is desirable that the pre-training step preserves graph properties that are compatible with the given task. However, since different downstream tasks often have different objectives, how do we unify pre-training with various downstream tasks on graphs, so that a single pre-trained model can universally support different tasks? That is, we try to convert the pre-training task and downstream tasks to follow the same "template". Using pretrained language models as an analogy, both their pre-training and downstream tasks can be formulated as masked language modeling.</p><p>Secondly, under the unification framework, it is still important to identify the distinction between different downstream tasks, in order to attain task-specific optima. For pre-trained language models, prompts in the form of natural language tokens or learnable word vectors have been designed to give different hints to different tasks, but it is less apparent what form prompts on graphs should take. Hence, how do we design prompts on graphs, so that they can guide different downstream tasks to effectively make use of the pre-trained model? Present work. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph pre-training and prompting framework, called GraphPrompt, aiming to unify the pre-training and downstream tasks for GNNs. Drawing inspiration from the prompting strategy for pre-trained language models, GraphPrompt capitalizes on a unified template to define the objectives for both pre-training and downstream tasks, thus bridging their gap. We further equip GraphPrompt with taskspecific learnable prompts, which guides the downstream task to exploit relevant knowledge from the pre-trained GNN model. The unified approach endows GraphPrompt with the ability of working on limited supervision such as few-shot learning tasks.</p><p>More specifically, to address the first challenge of unification, we focus on graph topology, which is a key enabler of graph models. In particular, subgraph is a universal structure that can be leveraged for both node-and graph-level tasks. At the node level, the information of a node can be enriched and represented by its contextual subgraph, i.e., a subgraph where the node resides in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>; at the graph level, the information of a graph is naturally represented by the maximum subgraph (i.e., the graph itself). Consequently, we unify both the node-and graph-level tasks, whether in pre-training or downstream, into the same template: the similarity calculation of (sub)graph<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> representations. In this work, we adopt link prediction as the self-supervised pre-training task, given that links are readily available in any graph without additional annotation cost. Meanwhile, we focus on the popular node classification and graph classification as downstream tasks, which are node-and graphlevel tasks, respectively. All these tasks can be cast as instances of learning subgraph similarity. On one hand, the link prediction task in pre-training boils down to the similarity between the contextual subgraphs of two nodes, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. On the other hand, the downstream node or graph classification task boils down to the similarity between the target instance (a node's contextual subgraph or the whole graph, resp.) and the class prototypical subgraphs constructed from labeled data, as illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>) and (c). The unified template bridges the gap between the pre-training and different downstream tasks.</p><p>Toward the second challenge, we distinguish different downstream tasks by way of the ReadOut operation on subgraphs. The ReadOut operation is essentially an aggregation function to fuse node representations in the subgraph into a single subgraph representation. For instance, sum pooling, which sums the representations of all nodes in the subgraph, is a practical and popular scheme for ReadOut. However, different downstream tasks can benefit from different aggregation schemes for their ReadOut. In particular, node classification tends to focus on features that can contribute to the representation of the target node, while graph classification tends to focus on features associated with the graph class. Motivated by such differences, we propose a novel task-specific learnable prompt to guide the ReadOut operation of each downstream task with an appropriate aggregation scheme. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the learnable prompt serves as the parameters of the ReadOut operation of downstream tasks, and thus enables different aggregation functions on the subgraphs of different tasks. Hence, GraphPrompt not only unifies the pre-training and downstream tasks into the same template based on subgraph similarity, but also recognize the differences between various downstream tasks to guide task-specific objectives.</p><p>Contributions. To summarize, our contributions are three-fold. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> We recognize the gap between graph pre-training and downstream tasks, and propose a unification framework GraphPrompt based on subgraph similarity for both pre-training and downstream tasks, including both node and graph classification tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> We propose a novel prompting strategy for GraphPrompt, hinging on a learnable prompt to actively guide downstream tasks using task-specific aggregation in ReadOut, in order to drive the downstream tasks to exploit the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. (3) We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of GraphPrompt in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Graph representation learning. The rise of graph representation learning, including earlier graph embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> and recent GNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>, opens up great opportunities for various downstream tasks at node and graph levels.

We refer the readers to two comprehensive surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> for more details.</p><p>Graph pre-training. Inspired by the application of pre-training models in language <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> and vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> domains, graph pretraining <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> emerges as a powerful paradigm that leverages selfsupervision on label-free graphs to learn intrinsic graph properties. While the pre-training learns a task-agnostic prior, a relatively light-weight fine-tuning step is further employed to update the pre-trained weights to fit a given downstream task. Different pretraining approaches design different self-supervised tasks based on various graph properties such as node features <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, links <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, local or global patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, localglobal consistency <ref type="bibr">[14, 32, 37?</ref> ], and their combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>.</p><p>However, the above approaches do not consider the gap between pre-training and downstream objectives, which limits their generalization ability to handle different tasks. Some recent studies recognize the importance of narrowing this gap. L2P-GNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> capitalizes on meta-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to simulate the fine-tuning step during pre-training. However, since the downstream tasks can still differ from the simulation task, the problem is not fundamentally addressed. In other fields, as an alternative to fine-tuning, researchers turn to prompting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, in which a task-specific prompt is used to cue the downstream tasks. Prompts can be either handcrafted <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> or learnable <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. On graph data, the study of prompting is still limited. One recent work called GPPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> capitalizes on a sophisticated design of learnable prompts on graphs, but it only works with node classification, lacking a unification effort to accommodate other downstream tasks like graph classification. Besides, there is a model also named as GraphPrompt <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, but it considers an NLP task (biomedical entity normalization) on text data, where graph is only auxiliary. It employs the standard text prompt unified by masked language modeling, assisted by a relational graph to generate text templates, which is distinct from our work.</p><p>Comparison to other settings. Our few-shot setting is different from other paradigms that also deal with label scarcity, including semi-supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and meta-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In particular, semi-supervised learning cannot cope with novel classes not seen in training, while meta-learning requires a large volume of labeled data in their base classes for a meta-training phase, before they can handle few-shot tasks in testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PRELIMINARIES</head><p>In this section, we give the problem definition and introduce the background of GNNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem Definition</head><p>Graph. A graph can be defined as ? = (? , ?), where ? is the set of nodes and ? is the set of edges. We also assume an input feature matrix of the nodes, X ? R |? |?? , is available. Let x ? ? R ? denote the feature vector of node ? ? ? ? . In addition, we denote a set of graphs as G = {? 1 , ? 2 , . . . , ? ? }.</p><p>Problem. In this paper, we investigate the problem of graph pretraining and prompting. For the downstream tasks, we consider the popular node classification and graph classification tasks. For node classification on a graph ? = (? , ?), let ? be the set of node classes with ? ? ? ? denoting the class label of node ? ? ? ? . For graph classification on a set of graphs G, let C be the set of graph labels with ? ? ? C denoting the class label of graph ? ? ? G.</p><p>In particular, the downstream tasks are given limited supervision in a few-shot setting: for each class in the two tasks, only ? labeled samples (i.e., nodes or graphs) are provided, known as ?-shot classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Graph Neural Networks</head><p>The success of GNNs boils down to the message-passing mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, in which each node receives and aggregates messages (i.e., features or embeddings) from its neighboring nodes to generate its own representation. This operation of neighborhood aggregation can be stacked in multiple layers to enable recursive message passing. Formally, in the ?-th GNN layer, the embedding of node ?, denoted by h ? ? , is calculated based on the embeddings in the previous layer, as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h ? ? = Aggr(h ?-1 ? , {h ?-1 ? : ? ? N ? }; ? ? ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where N ? is the set of neighboring nodes of ?, ? ? is the learnable GNN parameters in layer ?. Aggr(?) is the neighborhood aggregation function and can take various forms, ranging from the simple mean pooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> to advanced neural networks such as neural attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> or multi-layer perceptrons <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Note that in the first layer, the input node embedding h 0 ? can be initialized as the node features in X. The total learnable GNN parameters can be denoted as ? = {? 1 , ? 2 , . . .}. For brevity, we simply denote the output node representations of the last layer as h ? .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PROPOSED APPROACH</head><p>In this section, we present our proposed approach GraphPrompt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Unification Framework</head><p>We first introduce the overall framework of GraphPrompt in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Our framework is deployed on a set of label-free graphs shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a), for pre-training in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(b</ref>). The pre-training adopts a link prediction task, which is self-supervised without requiring extra annotation. Afterward, in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(c</ref>), we capitalize on a learnable prompt to guide each downstream task, namely, node classification or graph classification, for task-specific exploitation of the pretrained model. In the following, we explain how the framework supports a unified view of pre-training and downstream tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instances as subgraphs.</head><p>The key to the unification of pre-training and downstream tasks lies in finding a common template for the tasks. The task-specific prompt can then be further fused with the template of each downstream task, to distinguish the varying characteristics of different tasks.</p><p>In comparison to other fields such as visual and language processing, graph learning is uniquely characterized by the exploitation of graph topology. In particular, subgraph is a universal structure capable of expressing both node-and graph-level instances. On one hand, at the node level, every node resides in a local neighborhood, which in turn contextualizes the node <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. The local neighborhood of a node ? on a graph ? = (? , ?) is usually defined by a contextual subgraph ? ? = (? (? ? ), ? (? ? )), where its set of nodes and edges are respectively given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">? (? ? ) = {? (?, ?) ? ? | ? ? ? }, and<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">? (? ? ) = {(?, ? ? ) ? ? | ? ? ? (? ? ), ? ? ? ? (? ? )},<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ? (?, ?) gives the shortest distance between nodes ? and ? on the graph ?, and ? is a predetermined threshold. That is, ? ? consists of nodes within ? hops from the node ?, and the edges between those nodes. Thus, the contextual subgraph ? ? embodies not only the self-information of the node ?, but also rich contextual information to complement the self-information <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. On the other hand, at the graph level, the maximum subgraph of a graph ?, denoted ? ? , is the graph itself, i.e., ? ? = ?. The maximum subgraph ? ? spontaneously embodies all information of ?. In summary, subgraphs can be used to represent both node-and graph-level instances: Given an instance ? which can either be a node or a graph (e.g., ? = ? or ? = ?), the subgraph ? ? offers a unified access to the information associated with ?.</p><p>Unified task template. Based on the above subgraph definitions for both node-and graph-level instances, we are ready to unify different tasks to follow a common template. Specifically, the link prediction task in pre-training and the downstream node and graph classification tasks can all be redefined as subgraph similarity learning. Let s ? be the vector representation of the subgraph ? ? , and sim(?, ?) be the cosine similarity function. As illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure">2(b</ref>) and (c), the three tasks can be mapped to the computation of subgraph similarity, which is formalized below.</p><p>?

In our implementation, we simply use sum pooling. In summary, the unification framework is enabled by the common task template of subgraph similarity learning, which lays the foundation of our pre-training and prompting strategies as we will introduce in the following parts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Pre-Training Phase</head><p>As discussed earlier, our pre-training phase employs the link prediction task. Using link prediction/generation is a popular and natural way <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, as a vast number of links are readily available on large-scale graph data without extra annotation. In other words, the link prediction objective can be optimized on label-free graphs, such as those shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref>, in a self-supervised manner.</p><p>Based on the common template defined in Sect. 4.1, the link prediction task is anchored on the similarity of the contextual subgraphs of two candidate nodes. Generally, the subgraphs of two positive (i.e., linked) candidates shall be more similar than those of negative (i.e., non-linked) candidates, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(b)</ref>. Subsequently, the pre-trained prior on subgraph similarity can be naturally transferred to node classification downstream, which shares a similar intuition: the subgraphs of nodes in the same class shall be more similar than those of nodes from different classes. On the other hand, the prior can also support graph classification downstream, as graph similarity is consistent with subgraph similarity not only in letter (as a graph is technically always a subgraph of itself), but also in spirit. The "spirit" here refers to the tendency that graphs sharing similar subgraphs are likely to be similar themselves, which means graph similarity can be translated into the similarity of the containing subgraphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>.</p><p>Formally, given a node ? on graph ?, we randomly sample one positive node ? from ?'s neighbors, and a negative node ? from the graph that does not link to ?, forming a triplet (?, ?, ?). Our objective is to increase the similarity between the contextual subgraphs ? ? and ? ? , while decreasing that between ? ? and ? ? . More generally, on a set of label-free graphs G, we sample a number of triplets from each graph to construct an overall training set T pre . Then, we define the following pre-training loss.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L pre (?) = - ?? (?,?,?) ?T pre ln exp(sim(s ? , s ? )/?) ? ? {?,? } exp(sim(s ? , s ? )/?) ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where ? is a temperature hyperparameter to control the shape of the output distribution. Note that the loss is parameterized by ?, which represents the GNN model weights.</p><p>The output of the pre-training phase is the optimal model parameters ? 0 = arg min ? L pre (?). ? 0 can be used to initialize the GNN weights for downstream tasks, thus enabling the transfer of prior knowledge downstream.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Prompting for Downstream Tasks</head><p>The unification of pre-training and downstream tasks enables more effective knowledge transfer as the tasks in the two phases are made more compatible by following a common template. However, it is still important to distinguish different downstream tasks, in order to capture task individuality and achieve task-specific optimum.</p><p>To cope with this challenge, we propose a novel task-specific learnable prompt on graphs, inspired by prompting in natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In language contexts, a prompt is initially a handcrafted instruction to guide the downstream task, which provides task-specific cues to extract relevant prior knowledge through a unified task template (typically, pre-training and downstream tasks are all mapped to masked language modeling). More recently, learnable prompts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> have been proposed as an alternative to handcrafted prompts, to alleviate the high engineering cost of the latter.</p><p>Prompt design. Nevertheless, our proposal is distinctive from language-based prompting for two reasons. Firstly, we have a different task template from masked language modeling. Secondly, since our prompts are designed for graph structures, they are more abstract and cannot take the form of language-based instructions. Thus, they are virtually impossible to be handcrafted. Instead, they should be topology related to align with the core of graph learning. In particular, under the same task template of subgraph similarity learning, the ReadOut operation (used to generate the subgraph representation) can be "prompted" differently for different downstream tasks. Intuitively, different tasks can benefit from different aggregation schemes for their ReadOut. For instance, node classification pays more attention to features that are topically more relevant to the target node. In contrast, graph classification tends to focus on features that are correlated to the graph class. Moreover, the important features may also vary given different sets of instances or classes in a task.</p><p>Formally, let p ? denote a learnable prompt vector for a downstream task ?, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(c</ref>). The prompt-assisted ReadOut operation on a subgraph ? ? for task ? is</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">s ?,? = ReadOut({p ? ? h ? : ? ? ? (? ? )}),<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where s ?,? is the task ?-specific subgraph representation, and ? denotes the element-wise multiplication. That is, we perform a feature weighted summation of the node representations from the subgraph, where the prompt vector p ? is a dimension-wise reweighting in order to extract the most relevant prior knowledge for the task ?.</p><p>Note that other prompt designs are also possible. For example, we could consider a learnable prompt matrix P ? , which applies a linear transformation to the node representations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">s ?,? = ReadOut({P ? h ? : ? ? ? (? ? )}). (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>More complex prompts such as an attention layer is another alternative. However, one of the main motivation of prompting instead of fine-tuning is to reduce reliance on labeled data. In few-shot settings, given very limited supervision, prompts with fewer parameters are preferred to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Hence, the feature weighting scheme in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>) is adopted for our prompting as the prompt is a single vector of the same length as the node representation, which is typically a small number (e.g., 128).</p><p>Prompt tuning. To optimize the learnable prompt, also known as prompt tuning, we formulate the loss based on the common template of subgraph similarity, using the prompt-assisted taskspecific subgraph representations. Formally, consider a task ? with a labeled training set T ? = {(? 1 , ? 1 ), (? 2 , ? 2 ), . . .}, where ? ? is an instance (i.e., a node or a graph), and ? ? ? ? is the class label of ? ? among the set of classes ? . The loss for prompt tuning is defined as where the class prototypical subgraph for class ? is represented by s?,? , which is also generated by the prompt-assisted, task-specific ReadOut.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">L prompt (p ? ) = - ?? (? ? ,</formula><p>Note that, the prompt tuning loss is only parameterized by the learnable prompt vector p ? , without the GNN weights. Instead, the pre-trained GNN weights ? 0 are frozen for downstream tasks, as no fine-tuning is necessary. This significantly decreases the number of parameters to be updated downstream, thus not only improving the computational efficiency of task learning and inference, but also reducing the reliance on labeled data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>In this section, we conduct extensive experiments including node classification and graph classification as downstream tasks on five benchmark datasets to evaluate the proposed GraphPrompt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>Datasets. We employ five benchmark datasets for evaluation. (1) Flickr <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> is an image sharing network. (2) PROTEINS <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is a collection of protein graphs which include the amino acid sequence, conformation, structure, and features such as active sites of the proteins. (3) COX2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is a dataset of molecular structures including 467 cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. (4) ENZYMES <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> is a dataset of 600 enzymes collected from BRENDA enzyme database. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) BZR <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is a collection of 405 ligands for benzodiazepine receptor.</p><p>We summarize these datasets in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>, and present further details in Appendix B. Note that the "Task" column indicates the type of downstream task performed on each dataset: "N" for node classification and "G" for graph classification.</p><p>Baselines. We evaluate GraphPrompt against the state-of-the-art approaches from three main categories, as follows. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) End-to-end graph neural networks: GCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, GraphSAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, GAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and GIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. They capitalize on the key operation of neighborhood aggregation to recursively aggregate messages from the neighbors, and work in an end-to-end manner. (2) Graph pre-training models: DGI <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, InfoGraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and GraphCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. They work in the "pretrain, fine-tune" paradigm. In particular, they pre-train the GNN models to preserve the intrinsic graph properties, and fine-tune the pre-trained weights on downstream tasks to fit task labels. (3) Graph prompt models: GPPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. GPPT utilizes a link prediction task for pre-training, and resorts to a learnable prompt for the node classification task, which is mapped to a link prediction task.</p><p>Note that other few-shot learning methods on graphs, such as Meta-GNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> and RALE <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, adopt a meta-learning paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Thus, they cannot be used in our setting, as they require labeled data in their base classes for the meta-training phase. In our approach, only label-free graphs are utilized for pre-training.</p><p>Settings and parameters. To evaluate the goal of our Graph-Prompt in realizing a unified design that can suit different downstream tasks flexibly, we consider two typical types of downstream tasks, i.e., node classification and graph classification. In particular, for the datasets which are suitable for both of these two tasks, i.e., PROTEINS and ENZYMES, we only pre-train the GNN model once on each dataset, and utilize the same pre-trained model for the two downstream tasks with their task-specific prompting.</p><p>The downstream tasks follow a ?-shot classification setting. For each type of downstream task, we construct a series of ?-shot classification tasks. The details of task construction will be elaborated later when reporting the results in Sect. 5.2. For task evaluation, as the ?-shot tasks are balanced classification, we employ accuracy as the evaluation metric following earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</p><p>For all the baselines, based on the authors' code and default settings, we further tune their hyper-parameters to optimize their performance. We present more implementation details of the baselines and our GraphPrompt in Appendix D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Performance Evaluation</head><p>As discussed, we perform two types of downstream task different from the link prediction task in pre-training, namely, node classification and graph classification in few-shot settings. We first evaluate on a fixed-shot setting, and then vary the shot numbers to see the performance trend.</p><p>Few-shot node classification. We conduct this node-level task on three datasets, i.e., Flickr, PROTEINS, and ENZYMES. Following a typical ?-shot setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>, we generate a series of few-shot tasks for model training and validation. In particular, for PROTEINS and ENZYMES, on each graph we randomly generate ten 1-shot node classification tasks (i.e., in each task, we randomly sample 1 node per class) for training and validation, respectively. Each training task is paired with a validation task, and the remaining nodes not sampled by the pair of training and validation tasks will be used for testing. For Flickr, as it contains a large number of very sparse node features, selecting very few shots for training may result in inferior performance for all the methods. Therefore, we randomly generate ten 50-shot node classifcation tasks, for training and validation, respectively. On Flickr, 50 shots are still considered few, accounting for less than 0.06% of all nodes on the graph.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> illustrates the results of few-shot node classification. We have the following observations. First, our proposed Graph-Prompt outperforms all the baselines across the three datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of GraphPrompt in transferring knowledge from the pre-training to downstream tasks for superior performance. In particular, by virtue of the unification framework and prompt-based task-specific aggregation in ReadOut function, GraphPrompt is able to close the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks, and derive the downstream tasks to exploit the pre-trained model in task-specific manner. Second, compared to graph pre-training models, GNN models usually achieve comparable or even slightly better performance. This implies that the discrepancy between the pre-training and downstream tasks in these  pre-training models, obstructs the knowledge transfer from the former to the latter. In such case, even with sophisticated pre-training, they cannot effectively promote the performance of downstream tasks. Third, the graph prompt model GPPT is only comparable to or even worse than the other baselines, despite also using prompts.</p><p>A potential reason is that GPPT requires much more learnable parameters in their prompts than ours, which may not work well given very few shots (e.g., 1-shot).</p><p>Few-shot graph classification. We further conduct few-shot graph classification on four datasets, i.e., PROTEINS, COX2, ENZYMES, and BZR. For each dataset, we randomly generate 100 5-shot classification tasks for training and validation, following a similar process for node classification tasks. We illustrate the results of few-shot graph classification in Table 3, and have the following observations. First, our proposed GraphPrompt significantly outperforms the baselines on these four datasets. This again demonstrates the necessity of unification for pre-training and downstream tasks, and the effectiveness of prompt-assisted task-specific aggregation for ReadOut. Second, as both node and graph classification tasks share the same pre-trained model on PROTEINS and ENZYMES, the superior performance of GraphPrompt on both types of tasks further demonstrates that, the gap between different tasks is well addressed by virtue of our unification framework. Third, the graph pre-training models generally achieve better performance than the end-to-end GNN models. This is because both InfoGraph and GraphCL capitalize on graph-level tasks for pre-training, which are naturally not far away from the downstream graph classification.  Performance with different shots. We study the impact of number of shots on the PROTEINS and ENZYMES datasets. For node classification, we vary the number of shots between 1 and 10, and compare with several competitive baselines (i.e., GIN, DGI, GraphCL, and GPPT) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. For few-shot graph classification, we vary the number of shots between 1 and 30, and compare with competitive baselines (i.e., GIN, InfoGraph, and GraphCL) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. The task settings are identical to those stated earlier.</p><p>In general, our proposed GraphPrompt consistently outperforms the baselines especially with lower shots. For node classification, as the number of nodes in each graph is relatively small, 10 shots per class might be sufficient for semi-supervised node classification. Nevertheless, GraphPrompt is competitive even with 10 shots. For graph classification, GraphPrompt can be surpassed by some baselines when given more shots (e.g., 20 or more), especially on ENZYMES. On this dataset, 30 shots per class implies 30% of the 600 graphs are used for training, which is not our target scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Model Analysis</head><p>We further analyse several aspects of our model. Due to space constraint, we only report the ablation and parameter efficiency study, and leave the rest to Appendix E.</p><p>Ablation study. To evaluate the contribution of each component, we conduct an ablation study by comparing GraphPrompt with different prompting strategies: (1) no prompt: for downstream tasks,   we remove the prompt vector, and conduct classification by employing a classifier on the subgraph representations obtained by a direct sum-based ReadOut. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) lin. prompt: we replace the prompt vector with a linear transformation matrix in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">13</ref>).</p><p>We conduct the ablation study on three datasets for node classification (Flickr, PROTEINS, and ENZYMES) and graph classification (COX2, ENZYMES, and BZR), respectively, and illustrate the comparison in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. We have the following observations. (1) Without the prompt vector, no prompt usually performs the worst in the four models, showing the necessity of prompting the ReadOut operation differently for different downstream tasks. (2) Converting the prompt vector into a linear transformation matrix also hurts the performance, as the matrix involves more parameters thus increasing the reliance on labeled data.</p><p>Parameter efficiency. We also compare the number of parameters that needs to be updated in a downstream node classification task for a few representative models, as well as their number of floating point operations (FLOPs), in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>.</p><p>In particular, as GIN works in an end-to-end manner, it is obvious that it involves the largest number of parameters for updating. For GPPT, it requires a separate learnable vector for each class as its representation, and an attention module to weigh the neighbors for aggregation in the structure token generation. Therefore, GPPT needs to update more parameters than GraphPrompt, which is one factor that impairs its performance in downstream tasks. We also employ GraphPrompt+ft, a variant of our model that also performs fine-tuning instead of freezing the pre-trained weights, in addition to prompt tuning, which naturally updates more parameters. For our proposed GraphPrompt, it not only outperforms the baselines GIN and GPPT as we have seen earlier, but also requires the least parameters and FLOPs for downstream tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we studied the research problem of prompting on graphs and proposed GraphPrompt, in order to overcome the limitations of graph neural networks in the supervised or "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigms. In particular, to narrow the gap between pretraining and downstream objectives on graphs, we introduced a unification framework by mapping different tasks to a common task template. Moreover, to distinguish task individuality and achieve task-specific optima, we proposed a learnable task-specific prompt vector that guides each downstream task to make full of the pretrained model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets, and show that GraphPrompt significantly outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines.     ? GPPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. GPPT pre-trains a GNN model based on link prediction task, and resort to prompt to organize the node classification task into the same format of link prediction for prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D Further Implementation Details</head><p>For baseline GCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we employ a 3-layer architecture, and set the hidden dimensions as 32. For GraphSAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we utilize the mean aggregator, and employ a 3-layer architecture. The hidden dimensions are also set to 32. For GAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, we employ a 2-layer architecture and set the hidden dimension as 32. Besides, we apply 4 attention heads in the first GAT layer. Similarly, for GIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, we also employ a 3-layer architecture and set the hidden dimensions as 32. For DGI <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, we use a 1-layer GCN as the base model, and set the hidden dimension as 512. Besides, we utilize prelu as the activation function. For InfoGraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, we use a 3-layer GIN as the base model, and set its hidden dimensions as 32. For GraphCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>,</p><p>we also employ 3-layer GIN as its base model, and set the hidden dimensions as 32.

In addition, we set ? = 1 to induce the subgraphs for nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E Further Experimental Results</head><p>Scalability study. We investigate the scalability of GraphPrompt on dataset PROTEINS for graph classification. We increase the graph sizes (number of nodes) from 50 to 100 to form 6 groups, and select 10 graphs for each group which have corresponding graphs sizes (maybe approaching). We record the training time of each epoch and illustrate the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">VI</ref>. Note that, here we also report the training time for GraphPrompt-ft, a variant of GraphPrompt, by updating all the parameters including those of GNNs for finetruning. We first observe that the training of our GraphPrompt increases linearly as the increase of the graph sizes, demonstrating the scalability of GraphPrompt when scaling to large graphs. In addition, compared to GraphPrompt, GraphPrompt-ft needs more training time, showing the inefficiency of the fine-tuning paradigm.</p><p>Parameters sensitivity. We evaluate the sensitivity of two important hyperparameters in GraphPrompt, and show the impact in Figs. VII and VIII for node classification and graph classification, respectively. For the number of hops in generating the subgraphs on node classification, the performance gradually decreases as the number of hop increases. This is because a broader subgraph fails to characterize the target node, attributing to the over-smoothing issue on graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. While for graph classification, the number of hops does not show a clear trend, implying less impact on graph classification since both small and large subgraphs are helpful since they can intrinsically represent the graphs with different sizes. For the hidden dimension of GraphPrompt, a mediate dimension is better for node classification, such as 32 and 64. For graph classification, larger dimensions might be better, such as 64 and 128.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDICES A Algorithm and Complexity Analysis</head><p>Algorithm. We present the algorithm for prompt design and tuning of GraphPrompt in Alg. <ref type="bibr">1.</ref> In line 1, we initialize the prompt vector and the objective L. In lines 2-3, we obtain the node embeddings of input graphs based on the pre-trained GNN. In lines 5-13, we accumulate the loss for the given tuning samples. In particular, in lines 5-6, we design the prompt for the specific task ?. In lines 7-8, we calculate the subgraph representation for each class prototype. Then, in lines 9-13, we calculate and accumulate the loss and get the overall objective. Finally, in line 14 we optimize the prompt vector by minimizing the objective L.</p></div>

Furthermore, if some neighborhood sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is adopted during GNN aggregation, d is a relatively small constant too.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Further Descriptions of Datasets</head><p>We provide further details of the datasets.</p><p>(1) Flickr <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> is an image sharing network which is collected by SNAP 2 . In particular, each node is an image, and there exists an edge between two images if they share some common properties, such as commented by the same user, or from the same location. Each image belongs to one of the 7 categories.</p><p>(2) PROTEINS <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is a collection of protein graphs which include the amino acid sequence, conformation, structure, and features such 2 https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ as active sites of the proteins. Each node represents the secondary structures, and each edge depicts the neighboring relation in the amino-acid sequence or in 3D space. The nodes belong to three categories, and the graphs belong to two classes.</p><p>(3) COX2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is a dataset of molecular structures including 467 cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, in which each node is an atom, and each edge represents the chemical bond between atoms, such as single, double, triple or aromatic. All the moleculars belong to two categories.</p><p>(4) ENZYMES <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> is a dataset of 600 enzymes collected from BRENDA enzyme database. These enzymes are labeled into 6 categories according to their top-level EC enzyme.</p><p>(5) BZR <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is a collection of 405 ligands for benzodiazepine receptor, in which each ligand is represented by a graph. All these ligands belong to 2 categories.</p><p>Note that we conduct node classification on Flickr, PROTEINS and ENZYMES, since their node labels generally appear on all the graphs, which is suitable for the setting of few-shot node classification on each graph. Note that, we only choose the graphs which consist of more than 50 nodes for the downstream node classification, to ensure there exist sufficient labeled nodes. Additionally, graph classification is conducted on PROTEINS, COX2, ENXYMES and BZR. We use the given node features in the cited datasets to initialize input feature vectors, without additional processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Further Descriptions of Baselines</head><p>In this section, we present more details for the baselines, which are chosen from three main categories.</p><p>(1) End-to-end graph neural networks.</p><p>? GCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>: GCN resorts to mean-pooling based neighborhood aggregation to receive messages from the neighboring nodes for node representation learning in an end-to-end manner. ? GraphSage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>: GraphSAGE has a similar neighborhood aggregation mechanism with GCN, while it focuses more on the information from the node itself. ? GAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> : GAT also depends on neighborhood aggregation for node representation learning in an end-to-end manner, while it can assign different weights to neighbors to reweight their contributions.</p><p>? GIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>: GIN employs a SUM aggregator to replace the meanpooling method in GCN to aggregate all the messages from neighboring nodes, which is demonstrated to be more powerful to capture the graph structures. (2) Graph pre-training models.</p><p>? DGI <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>: DGI capitalizes on a self-supervised method for pretraining, which based on the concept of mutual information (MI) maximization to maximize the estimated MI between the local augmented instances and the global representation. ? InfoGraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>: InfoGraph extends DGI to the graph level which aims to maximize the similarity between node embeddings and graph embeddings. ? GraphCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>: GraphCL applies different graph augmentations to exploit the structural information on the graphs, and aims to maximize the agreement between augmentations in different versions for graph pre-training. (3) Graph prompt models.</p></div>			</div>
