<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-VRP) and the Location Routing Problem (LRP). The 2E-VRP arises in two-level transportation systems such as those encountered in the context of city logistics. In such systems, freight arrives at a major terminal and is shipped through intermediate satellite facilities to the final customers. The LRP can be seen as a special case of the 2E-VRP in which vehicle routing is performed only at the second level. We have developed new neighborhood search operators by exploiting the structure of the two problem classes considered and have also adapted existing operators from the literature. The operators are used in a hierarchical scheme reflecting the multi-level nature of the problem. Computational experiments conducted on several sets of instances from the literature show that our algorithm outperforms existing solution methods for the 2E-VRP and achieves excellent results on the LRP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>We consider multi-level distribution systems in which freight arrives at a central depot and is transported further to so-called satellite facilities. From there, it is brought to the final customers by smaller vehicles. An important problem arising in the operation of such systems is how to efficiently route vehicles operating at both levels to service customers. This problem is known in the literature as the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-VRP).</p><p>As its name implies, the 2E-VRP considers two levels. The first level is the delivery from the central depot to the satellite facilities and the second level is the delivery from the satellites to the customers. A limit on the number of vehicles is imposed at each level. The objective is to minimize the total routing cost of the system. We assume that the location of the satellite facilities is known, but that customers are not assigned to a specific satellite facility in advance. Clearly, the 2E-VRP is a generalization of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and is thus NP-hard.</p><p>One application of the 2E-VRP is the concept of city logistics. In most cities space is limited, especially in the city center, and has to be shared between private and public passenger transport as well as parking facilities. Moreover, freight transportation produces congestion, polluting emissions and noise, and the presence of large, heavy vehicles is an uncomforting factor to the citizens. Frequently, large vehicles have low average loads and a high number of empty trips. Therefore, officials want to reduce the number of vehicles, especially freight vehicles, in the city center and they want to switch from large to smaller vehicles. The key idea is to develop an integrated logistics system encompassing all components by consolidating freight that comes from different shippers and coordinating the freight transportation in the city. These activities are included in so-called city logistics systems.</p><p>Consolidation and coordination activities arising in city logistics can be performed in a multi-level system. Multi-level systems are also common in multimodal freight transportation systems, where the different transportation modes induce a natural decomposition. To change from one level to another, intermodal cross-docking facilities are often used. These systems also arise in several other applications and they are needed whenever there is no direct shipping. Perboli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> mention more examples such as express delivery services, grocery and hypermarketproduct distribution, spare-parts distribution in the automotive market, e-commerce and home delivery services, and newspaper and press distribution.</p><p>To our knowledge, the only existing heuristic for the 2E-VRP is a multi-start procedure by Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Therefore, our objective is to propose a more general framework for problems with location and routing decisions. To this end, we have developed an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic. ALNS is an efficient metaheuristic paradigm that has yielded excellent results for several different routing problems (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). We have designed several new operators that take advantage of the structure of the problem and we have also adapted existing operators for the vehicle routing problem.</p><p>The proposed methodology is also used to address the Location Routing Problem (LRP), in which the number and locations of a set of facilities have to be determined simultaneously with the routes of vehicles servicing customers out of the selected facilities. The 2E-VRP is used to model the LRP, and the proposed ALNS heuristic is equally successful for both the 2E-VRP and the LRP using the same operators and parameter values.</p><p>The contributions of this paper are the following. First, we propose a new solution method for the 2E-VRP that outperforms existing algorithms. Second, we show that the single-level LRP can be modeled as a special case of the 2E-VRP and that our algorithm performs well on instances from the literature. Finally, we propose a new set of larger instances for the 2E-VRP containing up to 200 customers and 10 satellite facilities.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The problem is first described in Section 2 and an overview of the literature is given in Section 3. The solution method is then presented in detail in Section 4. Section 5 explains the adaptations necessary to solve the LRP and the minor algorithmic modifications. Finally, Section 6 presents computational results and Section 7 contains the conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Problem description</head><p>The 2E-VRP can be defined on a directed graph G ¼ ðV,AÞ, where V is the set of nodes and A is the set of arcs. The set V comprises three subsets of nodes: the depot node v 0 , the subset V s containing m satellites and the subset V c of n customers. The traveling cost between node i and node j is given by c ij . Each customer i has a demand d i , which cannot be split. The demand cannot be delivered by direct shipping from the depot, but must be consolidated in a satellite. The deliveries to the satellite facilities on the first level can be split. The vehicles have a capacity limit that has to be respected. This capacity is the same for all vehicles belonging to the same level, but can differ for each level. The capacities of the first and second-level vehicles are denoted by K 1 and K 2 , respectively. The number of vehicles available is given by b 1 for the first level and by b 2 for the second level.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates a 2E-VRP solution. The square represents the depot, the large dots are the satellite facilities and the small dots are the customers. The routes that serve the satellite facilities from the depot are called the first-level routes and they are represented by dashed lines. The second-level routes are those that start from a satellite facility and visit the customers.</p><p>The demand of a satellite facility is the sum of the customer demands that are assigned to it. Therefore, any change to the customer assignment affects the first-level routing, and a previously optimal solution to the first-level VRP can become a very poor or infeasible solution.</p><p>The LRP can also be modeled as a 2E-VRP. In the LRP, there is a set V s of m possible depots, where each depot j is associated with a capacity limit W j and an opening cost O j , and a set V c of n customers with given demands. The goal is to open a subset of depots and design routes from each depot such that customer demand is fulfilled, the capacity of the vehicles and depots is respected, and the opening cost of the depots as well as the routing cost is minimized. Costs for using a vehicle can also be added on the outgoing arcs of the satellites.</p><p>To model the LRP as a 2E-VRP, we introduce a dummy node for the first-level depot v 0 . The set of possible depots then corresponds to the satellite facilities. The important difference is that the first level now consists only of single customer routes and the cost of going from v 0 to a satellite is the opening cost of the corresponding potential depot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Literature review</head><p>We first review the literature on Two-Echelon Routing Problems and then on Location Routing Problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Two-Echelon Routing Problems</head><p>One of the first applications of routing in a two-echelon system was introduced by Jacobsen and Madsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. They considered the problem of distributing newspapers via transfer points. Three decisions have to be made in this problem: choosing the number and locations of the transfer points, designing tours from the printing office to the transfer points, and designing tours from the transfer points to the retailers. They developed a heuristic algorithm in which customers are assigned to their nearest satellite and the first-and second-level routes are constructed by three fast procedures. Unlike in the 2E-VRP, split deliveries on the first level were not considered.</p><p>Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> introduced and analyzed a possible organizational and technological framework for integrated urban freight management. They also proposed a location-allocation formulation for the problem of locating satellite facilities in a multi-echelon system. Customers were grouped into customer zones, and the cost of servicing a demand was measured by the cost of a path to the respective customer zone. Data from the city of Rome were used.</p><p>The 2E-VRP is a rather new problem, and it has been the object of a small number of studies. A flow-based formulation was introduced by Perboli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, who discussed several variants of the 2E-VRP. Three sets of instances were introduced, based on the instances for the VRP. These instances have up to 50 customers and 4 satellites. The authors presented two families of inequalities, which were used within a branch-and-cut framework. They were able to solve instances with 21 customers to optimality. Moreover, they also developed two mathematical programming-based heuristics. These heuristics use the proposed model and focus on the assignment variables that specify the customers serviced by each satellite facility.</p><p>A formulation for the time-dependent version with fleet synchronization and customer time windows was proposed by Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The authors reviewed the current state of the art, proposed a formulation for the time-dependent case and discussed promising algorithmic directions.</p><p>Perboli and Tadei <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed several new classes of valid inequalities. These are based on the Traveling Salesman Problem and the VRP, the network flow formulation, and the connectivity of the transportation-system graph. Their approach is able to solve seven new instances to optimality and reduce the optimality gap on several other instances.</p><p>A family of multi-start heuristics for the 2E-VRP was proposed by Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Their method is based on separating the first-level and the second-level routing. More precisely, they assign customers to satellites and solve the resulting m þ 1 VRPs, where m is the number of satellite facilities, by an exact algorithm. The solution is then perturbed and a local search is applied until a maximum number of iterations is reached. The perturbation phase consists of randomized changes to the customer-to-satellite assignment. A clustering based heuristic is used as local search, where the neighborhood consists of assigning customers to new satellites. More precisely, the customers are sorted in increasing order according to the difference between the current and the next best satellite assignment. Then, one after another, all the customers for which this new assignment is feasible are inserted into the new positions.</p><p>Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> provided an analysis of the impact of parameters on total cost in a 2E-VRP. They studied different locations of the depot, the satellites, the distribution of the customers and the number of satellites using the algorithm of Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. They analyzed up to which point opening satellites can reduce the total cost. They concluded that the 2E-VRP performs better compared to the classical VRP when the depot is located externally with respect to the customer area.</p><p>In our computational study we compare our algorithm to the best solutions found by Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Perboli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Perboli and Tadei <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The Location Routing Problem</head><p>A seminal introduction to location routing was provided by Laporte <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. His paper reviews the state of the art on heuristic and exact methods for this problem class. It also illustrates the different versions of problems that combine location and routing and describes in which applications they arise. Moreover, different formulations are provided.</p><p>Early heuristics for the LRP were developed by Tuzun and Burke <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, Barreto <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. We refer to Nagy and Salhi <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for a literature review.</p><p>More recently, Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed a Lagrangean relaxation-granular tabu search (LRGTS) algorithm. They decompose the problem into a depot-location phase and a routing phase and alternate between the two. For the depot-location phase they aggregate customers into supercustomers and solve a facility location problem by a Lagrangean relaxation approach. For the routing phase they developed a granular tabu search completed by a local search based on move, swap and extended 2-opt moves. The move operator shifts one customer to another position, while swap exchanges two customers. The 2-opt operator was introduced by Croes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Two edges of a tour are deleted and reconnected in such a way that the sequence between those edges has to be inverted. If the solution has not improved, they perform restarts using edge frequency information.</p><p>A greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) calling an evolutionary local search (ELS) was developed by Duhamel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. They alternate between solutions encoded as giant tours, where the splitting procedure is used for evaluation, and complete LRP solutions. Moreover, they use a tabu list for opening depots and apply a local search based on move, swap and extended 2-opt operators.</p><p>In Pirkwieser and Raidl <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a variable neighborhood search was combined with three different ILP-based very large neighborhood searches (VLNS). Two of these operate on routes and one on customer sequences. The authors presented several combinations of the VLSN with VNS. They also showed results for the LRP as well as for the periodic LRP.</p><p>Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. A solution is represented as a giant tour. Move, swap and 2-opt are used as neighborhoods and they operate on the giant tour. Therefore, a neighborhood move can change a customer position, open or close depots or reassign customers to satellites.</p><p>Several exact algorithms have been proposed recently. Belenguer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> introduced a two-index integer programming formulation and families of valid inequalities. They were able to solve instances with up to 50 customers. Contardo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed a branch-and-cut algorithm and were able to solve larger instances with 88 customers and 8 depots. Akca et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> presented a set partitioning formulation for the LRP and developed a branch-and-price algorithm that was able to solve instances of up to 40 customers to optimality. Baldacci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> also proposed a branch-and-price algorithm that can solve instances with up to 199 customers and 14 facilities. Finally, Contardo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> developed a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm that yields improved bounds and could solve some of the open instances from the literature.</p><p>In the Two-Echelon Location Routing Problem (2E-LRP), the number and location of two types of capacitated facilities have to be determined. Furthermore, the size of the two different vehicle fleets and the routes on each level have to be optimized. Boccia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed three mixed-integer programming models for the 2E-LRP and tested them on instances they generated. A heuristic for the same problem was proposed by Boccia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The authors developed a tabu search that is based on a decomposition of the problem into two location-routing subproblems and a further decomposition of these sub-problems into a capacitated facility location problem and a multi-depot vehicle routing problem. They perform simple moves on every level and refer to their method as a multi-phase iterative-nested approach.</p><p>For the LRP, among the heuristic algorithms that were cited above, that of Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> performs very well and also has a very low runtime. Pirkwieser and Raidl <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have only tested one instance set from the literature and the average solution quality of their algorithm is slightly worse, but it is faster than the algorithm of Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Duhamel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> achieved good results, but they only report the best solution found over five runs. Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> achieved good results too. Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> only report one run of their respective algorithms, which use randomization. These four algorithms and the exact solution procedures mentioned have found the best known solutions to which we compare in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Solution method</head><p>The key ideas of the ALNS algorithm that we propose are the following. At every iteration, a number q of customers are removed by a destroy operator, put in a customer pool and then re-inserted by a repair operator. Some of the operators that we use explicitly open or close satellites, while others apply to a more restricted area of the search space, i.e., they remove a smaller number of customers and keep the current satellite configuration unchanged. The operators are selected by a roulette wheel mechanism based on their past success. Every operator is associated with a score. Operators that have successfully found new improving solutions have a higher score and therefore a higher probability of being chosen again.</p><p>ALNS was first developed by Ropke and Pisinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for the pickup and delivery problem and these authors later solved several variants of the vehicle routing problem with a general algorithm based on the same methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Compared to the latter method, we have a simplified mechanism to update the score and the acceptance criterion has no parameter. In addition, we apply a local search step after some of the operators.</p><p>Our algorithm works as follows (see Algorithm 1). Starting from an initial solution, a destroy operator is first chosen to remove q customers and a repair operator is then used to insert them back into the current solution. Since we are dealing with a two-level problem, we use a hierarchical structure for the destroy operators. There are two types of destroy operators: some that change the given configuration of satellites by opening or closing satellites and others that only affect a smaller part of the solution. In the following, D L represents the set of destroy operators that have a large impact, D S the set of operators that have a small impact, and R is the set of repair operators. The destroy operators in set D L , i.e., Satellite Removal, Satellite Opening and Satellite Swap, are executed whenever o iterations have been performed without improvement. The new solution yielded by any of these operators is passed through a local search phase. Moreover, it is accepted as a new incumbent even if it is not improving, i.e., it gets a free pass through the acceptance decision. Solutions yielded by the operators in set D S are only passed through local search if they are within y percent of the best found solution s n . Moreover, they are only accepted as a new incumbent solution if they have a better objective value than the current incumbent.</p><p>We differentiate between the small-and the large-impact destroy operators for the following reasons. The operators in set D L change the solutions substantially, especially on the first level. The repair operators are designed to insert a limited number of requests in a partial solution. Therefore, the large impact operators overburden the capabilities of the repair operators. The solution can be further improved in the local-search phase. Furthermore, the free pass as a new incumbent helps to explore the search space more thoroughly with the operators in set D S , while keeping the satellite configuration fixed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Algorithm 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Search space</head><p>To rely on simple procedures to construct an initial solution and modify this solution, the search is not restricted to feasible solutions. Instead, we allow violations of the constraints on vehicle capacity, number of vehicles available, and the capacity limits at the satellites (for the LRP), and we use a weighted penalty function to take these violations into account. More precisely, we consider the objective function f ðsÞ ¼ cðsÞþadðsÞþ beðsÞþggðsÞ, where c(s) is the operating cost of the system (i.e., routing cost and eventual opening cost of depots), d(s), e(s) and g(s) represent violations of the vehicle capacity, number of vehicles, and satellite capacity constraints, respectively, and a, b and g are the corresponding weights.</p><p>The weights a, b and g are adjusted dynamically during the search within the interval ½i; k, which has been determined experimentally. The lower endpoint guarantees that when a violation occurs, the algorithm starts off with a reasonable value, and the upper endpoint prevents the weights from going to infinity. Whenever the vehicle capacity constraint, the number of available vehicles, or the capacity limit at the satellites is exceeded, the respective weight is multiplied by the factor d41; when the solution is feasible, the respective weight is divided by d.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Initial solution</head><p>To construct an initial solution, every customer is first assigned to a satellite facility by a roulette wheel selection mechanism based on the distance to the customer. Then, the VRPs for the second level are solved by means of the Clarke and Wright <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> savings algorithm for every satellite. Finally, with the given demand at each satellite, the first-level routes are constructed using again the savings algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Destroy operators</head><p>In the following, we describe the destroy operators used in the algorithm. Some of them are new, while others have been proposed by Ropke and Pisinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and have been adapted to the 2E-VRP. Whenever applicable, the number of customers to remove, q, is randomly chosen in the range ½r,t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Satellite Removal</head><p>Among all the open satellites, we choose one randomly and close it. All customers that are currently assigned to this satellite are removed and put in the customer pool. Therefore, all the routes starting at that satellite are removed as well. Moreover, we select among the other satellites a random one and open it, in case it is not already open. This prevents situations in which all satellites would be closed because the only open one has been closed by the operator. This mechanism is also important for diversification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Satellite Opening</head><p>Here, we choose a satellite randomly among those that are closed and open it. Then, the q customers that are closest to this satellite are removed from their current route and inserted into the customer pool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">Satellite Swap</head><p>First, we apply the Satellite Removal operator. Next, a new satellite is chosen at random by a roulette wheel selection and is opened. The probability that a satellite is chosen is inversely proportional to the distance with respect to the satellite that has been removed. We want to favor the swaps of satellites that are close to each other so that the solution is not changed too drastically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4.">Random Removal</head><p>This operator was proposed by Ropke and Pisinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. It simply chooses q customers at random and puts them into the customer pool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.5.">Worst Removal</head><p>The Worst Removal is also based on a similar operator used by Ropke and Pisinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. This operator removes the q customers with the highest removal gain. More precisely, the gain is defined as the difference between the cost when the customer is in the solution and the cost when it is removed. The gain is normalized by dividing it by the average cost of the ingoing arcs of the corresponding node. The purpose of this normalization is to avoid repeatedly choosing customers that are located far away from the remaining ones. The cost is also perturbed by a factor d A ½0:8,1:2 in order to randomize the search.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.6.">Related Removal</head><p>A seed customer is chosen randomly and the qÀ1 customers that are located closest to the seed customer are identified. All of these customers are then removed from their current routes and put into the customer pool. Related Removal is similar to the one used by Pisinger and Ropke <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, but while they choose a chain of customers that are most related to each other based on the distance, we simple move the qÀ1 that are the closest to the seed customer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.7.">Route Removal</head><p>The Route Removal operator removes a random route and puts the corresponding customers into the customer pool. The opening of a new route at the corresponding satellite by an insertion operator is then forbidden to avoid cycling. Like Satellite Removal, this operator has a mechanism that can open a previously closed satellite because, in rare cases, all customers could be served by a single route originating from the only open satellite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.8.">Route Redistribution</head><p>For each open satellite, we choose a random number k, 1 rk r 3, of routes to be removed. The selection of the k routes works in the following way. One after another, we remove the routes containing the customer with the minimum distance between the satellite it is currently assigned to and any other open satellite. To introduce some randomization, distances are perturbed by a factor d A ½0:8,1:2. This operator is based on the idea that the customers that are close to several satellites may benefit more from reassignment than those for which the best assignment is more obvious. For example, the reassignment of a customer that is at the edge of a town, close to a satellite, but farther from the other ones, is not likely to reduce the cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Repair operators</head><p>The repair operators can only insert customers into routes originating from open satellites, i.e., satellites that currently have customers assigned to them or those that were opened by a destroy operator in the same iteration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1.">Greedy Insertion</head><p>For Greedy Insertion, the customers are inserted in a random order one after the other into the position that minimizes the insertion cost over all the open satellites and routes. We also check the possibility of opening a new route unless this is forbidden because the Route Removal operator was applied to the considered satellite. For the first level, we check whether the first-level routes would still be feasible after the increase in demand at this satellite facility. If not, we look for the cheapest insertion position of this satellite in the first-level routes. Afterwards, one-customer moves and swaps are performed for the first level to improve the routes. Note that Ropke and Pisinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> insert the customers according to the insertion cost and therefore they also recompute the insertion cost after each insertion. We chose the insertion by random order because we wanted to have a simple and fast insertion operator. Regret Insertion uses a more sophisticated mechanism with recalculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2.">Greedy Insertion Perturbation</head><p>This operator works like Greedy Insertion. The difference is that when we compute the insertion cost of a customer at each position, the cost is perturbed by a factor d A ½0:8,1:2 to introduce randomization. This operator was inspired by the algorithm of Ropke and Pisinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, which also added noise to their insertion heuristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3.">Greedy Insertion Forbidden</head><p>This operator works like Greedy Insertion but it is not allowed to serve a customer from the same satellite from which it was removed. We introduce this operator mostly for diversification purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.4.">Regret Insertion</head><p>In the regret heuristic, customers are treated in the order of their regret value. The regret value is the cost difference between the best insertion position and the second best. Thus, customers with a high regret value should be inserted first. More precisely, a regret-k heuristic chooses to insert customer i among the set U of untreated customers according to i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">¼ arg max i A U ð P k h ¼ 2 Df h i ÀDf 1 i Þ,</formula><p>where Df h i is the cost of inserting customer i at the hth cheapest position. This heuristic uses look-ahead information and can prevent situations where we have to insert a customer in a poor position because the better positions are no longer available. Unlike Ropke and Pisinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, we compute the regret value based on different positions that can also be in the same route, whereas they only look at insertion positions in different routes. Once a customer has been inserted, the insertion positions of the remaining unplaced customers have to be recomputed by considering the change caused by inserting this customer at a position. In this operator we do not compute the first-level cost change, but we focus on the second-level insertion cost only. Computing the first-level cost change would be too demanding, because after every insertion we should solve the first-level VRP for every customer and every satellite facility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.5.">First level local search</head><p>At each iteration, we also check if we can improve the firstlevel VRP. First, we perform a procedure where we generate a giant tour that contains all the satellites that serve at least one customer. We create this giant tour with a simple procedure that first inserts the customer that is farthest away from the depot into an empty tour. We then insert the remaining satellites at their respective cheapest position. Afterwards, we split the giant tour in a greedy way by going back to the depot whenever the capacity is exceeded even if this implies splitting customer demands. We finally improve the tour by performing moves and swaps with a maximum sequence length of one node. We also check for a solution that only contains out-and-back tours, i.e., tours that only contain one satellite, in case the local search could not find these tours. In the end, the best of these solutions is accepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Local search</head><p>Local search is performed after the Satellite Removal, Satellite Swap or Satellite Opening operator is applied. It is also executed for every new promising solution, i.e., a solution that is within a certain threshold y of the best solution found. Local search is performed for the VRPs of each satellite separately. Since it does not change the demand assigned to each satellite, there is no impact on the first level.</p><p>The local search consists of the following operators, which are performed sequentially: split, move, swap, 2-opt and 2-opt n . The split procedure was developed by Beasley <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and it has been used in several genetic algorithms for routing problems (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). In our implementation, we create a giant tour by linking the routes one after another. Afterwards, the depot node is deleted from every occurrence and reinserted with the split procedure.</p><p>The move operator relocates one customer to the best position in the same route or in a different route. Swap exchanges all possible segments of customers. For swap we consider sequences with a length of 1-4 customers. Both operators are performed inter-route and intra-route and all possible positions are examined, while 2-opt is performed intra-route.</p><p>Finally, we perform 2-opt n <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for every pair of routes u and v and every node iA u and j A v. More precisely, edges (i, iþ 1) and (j, j þ 1) can be replaced by edges (i, j þ1) and (j, i þ 1) or by edges (i, j) and (i þ 1, j þ 1), thus reversing the direction of visit between j and the depot as well as between i þ1 and the depot.</p><p>Moves are performed in a first-improvement manner as long as an improvement can be found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Selection of destroy and repair operators</head><p>The selection is based on the success of each operator in the previous iterations. The destroy and repair operators are weighted and chosen independently. Every time operator j finds a new global best solution, s is added to the score p j . The selection of the operators is based on a roulette wheel selection mechanism in which the probability of operator j being selected is p j = P p k ¼ 1 p k and p is the number of operators considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Location Routing Problem</head><p>The algorithm described in the previous section for the 2E-VRP is also able to solve the single level LRP with only minor modifications in the generation of the initial solution. The parameters and operators are the same for both problems.</p><p>The main difference between the settings of the 2E-VRP and the LRP is that in the latter problem there is no first-level depot and the satellites have both a capacity and a fixed cost. To account for this, we introduce a dummy node for the first-level depot and the cost of visiting a satellite corresponds to its opening cost. For satellite visits, only out-and-back tours are allowed and the capacity of each vehicle corresponds to the capacity of each depot. Therefore, for instances that have heterogenous depot capacities, the vehicles have different capacity limits which depend on the satellite visited.</p><p>For the LRP, the generation of the initial solution is done as follows. Among all the possible combinations of satellites to open, we chose the one that yields the lowest cost and whose capacity is large enough to accommodate the total demand. As for the 2E-VRP, customers are randomly assigned to a satellite with a bias towards the shortest distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Computational results</head><p>We have performed extensive computational experiments to set parameter values by sensitivity analyses and to compare the algorithm to state-of-the-art heuristics for both the 2E-VRP and the LRP. When we refer to the best known solutions, we include the best results that were found by the algorithms cited in Section 3.</p><p>Our algorithm was coded in Cþþ, compiled with GCC version 4.5.1 and tested on an 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron 275 Processor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Instance description</head><p>For the 2E-VRP, we have considered three instance sets from the literature. Sets numbered 2 and 3 were proposed by Perboli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and they are based on the following instances by Christofides and Eilon: E-n13-k4, E-n22-k4, E-n33-k4 and E-n51-k5. These authors have also proposed a very small set of instances (set 1) with just 1 depot, 12 customers and 2 satellites, which we did not use.</p><p>Set 4 was proposed by Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and contains 54 instances. Each has 50 customers and the number of satellites is either 2, 3 or 5. They were generated using three different customer distributions and three satellite location patterns (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for more details).</p><p>For the LRP, we have also considered three sets of instances. The first one was proposed by Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. It contains 30 instances with capacitated vehicles and depots. The number of customers ranges from 20 to 200 and the number of depots from 5 to 10. This set is referred to as set ''Prodhon'' in the literature. The second set, which is denoted set ''Tuzun'' in the literature, contains instances with uncapacitated depots and was introduced by Tuzun and Burke <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. It contains 36 instances with 100, 150 or 200 customers and 10 or 20 depots. The vehicles are capacitated. The third set, with 13 instances, was taken from Barreto <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These contain capacitated depots and vehicles and the set is referred to as set ''Barreto''. These sets have a homogenous, unlimited fleet, but the sets Prodhon and Tuzun have a fixed cost for each vehicle used.</p><p>We also introduce a new set of larger instances for the 2E-VRP, which we call set 5. To create this set, the 17 instances containing more than 50 customers from the set Prodhon of the LRP instances were adapted to the 2E-VRP. The missing data is the depot location, and for the first-level fleet the capacity limit and the limit on the number of vehicles. Moreover, for those instance the number of available vehicles for the second level is unlimited and there is a fixed cost per vehicle used. To obtain a more homogenous set of instances for the 2E-VRP, we removed the fixed cost per vehicle and we limited the fleet for the second level experimentally. The number of vehicles used in the best solution from preliminary tests was multiplied by 1.2 and rounded up. Concerning the first-level fleet, the limit on the number of vehicles was set to 5, and the capacity restriction of the vehicles was set to d</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P i A Vc d i =3e</formula><p>, so that at least 3 tours will be executed. Since we wanted to picture a setting where the depot is located on the outskirts of a city, we decided to place it in the northeast corner. Therefore, the depot coordinates were chosen to be 1:33x max and 1:33y max , where x max ¼ max i A Vc x i and y max ¼ max i A Vc y i .</p><p>A summary of the instance characteristics is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Parameter settings and sensitivity analyses</head><p>As mentioned above, the parameter settings are the same for both problems considered. We have chosen a representative subset of instances for the 2E-VRP and the LRP to tune the algorithm and find reasonable values for o and t.</p><p>The 2E-VRP instances are insensitive to changes in o, which is the threshold for the number of iterations without improvement after which the satellite destroy operators are called. For the LRP instances, we noticed that values for o in the range [100; 2000] yield the best solution quality. Therefore, we opted for setting o to 100. The number of customers to remove is a random integer between r and t. We set r to 1. As suggested in Pisinger and Ropke <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we set t to min f60,0:4ng. We also performed sensitivity analyses for t on the same subset of instances that we used for testing o. Again, the 2E-VRP instances are insensitive to changes. For the LRP instances, we noticed that when we increase t beyond 0:5n the solution quality becomes worse.</p><p>For the weighted penalty function, d was set to 1.1, i to 5 and k to 10,000. These values were chosen according to preliminary tests. The value s, added to the score p j every time a new best solution is found, is set to 1.</p><p>The stopping condition of the algorithm is the number of iterations performed. Preliminary tests showed that 500,000 iterations usually provide a good trade-off between run time and solution quality.</p><p>For the Regret Insertion, we used a regret-3 heuristic and the threshold y that identifies a promising solution that will undergo local search is set to 2%. Both values are also based on preliminary tests.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides statistics on the different operators. The second column shows the average cost deviation of the solutions found with and without this operator for a subset of representative instances. We ran the algorithm excluding each of the respective operators while keeping the other ones. The Regret Insertion is the most useful operator, followed by Route Removal and Route Redistribution. The results suggest that we can leave out some of the operators, but when we remove more than one of these operators, the solution quality becomes worse. Greedy Insertion Perturbation, for example, seems not necessary for this subset of instances, but in some cases this operator helps escaping from a local optimum. In the third column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we provide the average number of times a new best solution was found. These statistics are taken from five runs over all the instances of the 2E-VRP. The operators that change the satellite configuration hardly ever find a new best solution. This is because a change in the configuration affects the solution in a fundamental way and cannot be repaired in just one iteration. Among the destroy operators, Route Redistribution delivers a new best solution the least often. From the repair operators Regret Insertion is the most successful, followed by Greedy and Greedy Perturbation.</p><p>We have also evaluated the local search operators for the same subset of 2E-VRP instances. The operators move, swap, 2-opt and 2opt n have already been used in local search heuristics for many VRP variants. However, to our knowledge, the split operator has never been used in a local search framework, but only as a splitting procedure inside evolutionary algorithms. Our tests for the same subset of 2E-VRP instances show that the solutions found without the split operator are on average 0.2% worse than with the operator. It is powerful, because it can not only minimize the number of vehicles used, but also reassign customers from the beginning and end of each tour to other tours in the way ejection chains work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Computational results</head><p>We have compared our ALNS with other solution methods from the literature. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, we compare the ALNS to the best solutions found by the previous algorithms of Perboli and Tadei <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Perboli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Perboli and Tadei <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We give the average and minimum solution value of five runs, and the percentage deviation to the best known solutions. All values are averaged over the instances of the sets. We report the runtime in seconds in column T, which shows the total time, and in column T n , which shows the time at which the solution was found. Detailed results for all instances can be found in the Appendix in Tables <ref type="table">6</ref><ref type="table">7</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_5">8</ref>. For set 4, we report the average and the minimum of five runs. For sets 2 and 3, these are equivalent as the instances are smaller and the ALNS yields the same results in each of the five runs.</p><p>Sets 2 and 3 contain small instances with up to 50 customers and two or three satellites. The ALNS is either improving the upper bound or finds the optimal solution for the instances where it is known. More precisely, for the 21 instances of set 2, we found 19 ties, one improvement and one solution that is slightly worse (0.01%). For the 18 instances of set 3, we found 9 improvements and 9 ties. For set 2, we found 14 out of the 15 optimal solutions and for set 3, we found all 8 solutions for which optimality was proven. For all instances but five from instance set 4, the average solution quality of the ALNS is better than the quality of the best solutions found in the literature and for those five instances the gap to the best known solutions is very small (below 0.5%).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows results for the new larger instances that we created for the 2E-VRP. The table shows solution values of the ALNS with a stopping condition of 500 K iterations and of 5000 K iterations. Runtimes are given in minutes. The BKS were found with longer runtimes. When we compare the ALNS with a stopping condition of 500 K iterations, the average deviation to the BKS is still quite large. Apparently for these difficult instances a longer runtime is needed.</p><p>We have also tested our algorithm on the three sets of instances for the LRP. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows a summary of the best and most recent heuristic algorithms from the literature, the percentage deviation to the best known solutions, which have been found by all algorithms published so far, and the runtime in seconds. More precisely, we show the results for the TS of Tuzun and Burke <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, the GRASP of Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the MA9PM of Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the LRGTS of Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the GRASP Â ELS of Duhamel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the VLNS of Pirkwieser and Raidl <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the SA of Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Duhamel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> performed five runs and they only report the best solution found over the runs and the CPU time required to reach it within the corresponding run. Therefore, we cannot compare to the average solution quality of their algorithm. Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> only report one run of their respective algorithms, so it is difficult to assess the solution quality.</p><p>Pirkwieser and Raidl <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> report the average over 30 runs. We report both the average and the best solution of the ALNS found over five runs and also the time in CPU seconds, required to find the solutions (T n ) as well as the total running time of the algorithm (T). We show the results for 500 K iterations as well as for 5000 K.</p><p>The following computing environments were used. Duhamel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> implemented their algorithm using the Borland Cþþ 6.0 package and used a Quad Core 2.83 GHz computer under Windows XP with 8 GB of memory. The algorithms of Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> were implemented in Cþþ and the experiments were carried out using a Dell PC Optiplex GX260 with a 2.4 GHz Pentium and 512 MB of RAM under Windows XP. Pirkwieser and Raidl <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> coded their algorithm in Cþþ, compiled with GCC 4.3 and executed it on a single core of a 2.83 GHz Intel Core2 Quad Q9550 with 8 GB RAM. For the VLNS they used CPLEX version 12.1. The tabu search of Tuzun and Burke <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> was coded in Cþþ and run on a Gateway 2000 PC Model G6-266M with a 266 MHz Pentium II processor and the SA of Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> was implemented in C and run on a PC with an Intel Core2 Quad CPU with 2.6 GHz and 2 GB memory.</p><p>Among the existing heuristic solution methods the LRGTS of Prins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the VLNS of Pirkwieser and Raidl <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the GRASP Â ELS of Duhamel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the SA by Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> have obtained the best results so far.</p><p>For the set Prodhon, the VLNS obtains slightly worse results than the LRGTS, but it also needs less time. However, because the algorithms were run on different machines and different compilers were used, it is hard to make a direct comparison of run times. In terms of solution quality, the ALNS has comparable results to the LRGTS for the set Prodhon, while the SA obtains better results.</p><p>For the set Tuzun, the ALNS outperforms all the existing solution methods. The ALNS performs better on the set Tuzun because there is no capacity limit on the satellites in this set.</p><p>For the set Barreto, the SA yields similar results to ALNS, while the GRASP Â ELS yields the best results. In terms of runtime, our method is slower than the existing methods, except for the SA which has a comparable runtime. It is also worth mentioning that we compare runtimes from different machines and our computer seems to have a worse performance with a clock speed of 2.2 GHz compared to the machines used for the other algorithms. Moreover, since we are solving two problem classes, the data structures were not tailored for the LRP, but for the more complex 2E-VRP and there is a small computing overhead to solve both problem classes with the same code.</p><p>Detailed results for the LRP can be found in the Appendix (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_0">11</ref>). For set Prodhon, the solution quality of the ALNS is comparable to previous solution methods. On some instances the performance of the ALNS is not so good and this is mainly due to tight capacities on the depots. For set Tuzun, with uncapacitated depots, the ALNS can find several new best solutions. For three instances the average solution quality is even better than the best known solutions. For 12 instances the minimum of five runs can already improve the best solutions. Note that these results are achieved for the larger instances with 150 or 200 customers and 10 or 20 depots. For set Barreto, the ALNS finds the optimal or best known solutions in all but four instances.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">12</ref> in the Appendix shows the best solutions found for the LRP instances. For the set Prodhon our algorithm yields 16 ties and one new best known solutions, while for the remaining 13 instances we did not find nor improve the best found solution. For the set Tuzun, we find 19 new best solutions, 11 ties and 6 worse solutions. For the set Barreto, we find 11 ties and two slightly worse solutions.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">13</ref> in the Appendix lists the best solutions for the 2E-VRP. The ALNS yields 59 new best found solutions for the 93 instances that were tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented an ALNS heuristic for the 2E-VRP that also yields excellent results on the LRP. We have shown an easy modeling approach to transform LRP instances into 2E-VRP instances so as to address both problems with the same operators and parameter values. Our method uses existing operators and new operators designed specifically for the problem classes considered. It is simple and relies on a small number of parameters.</p><p>We have tested three instance sets from the literature for the 2E-VRP and three other sets for the LRP. For the 2E-VRP, our solution method outperforms existing algorithms from the literature. For the LRP, we achieve competitive results and outperform existing solutions methods on one instance set. Moreover, we have found several new best known solutions for standard benchmark instances. For the 2E-VRP we found 59 new best solutions out of 93 instances and for the LRP we improved 20 best found solutions out of 79 instances.</p><p>Finally, we have also proposed a new data set for the 2E-VRP that contains larger instances with 100 or 200 customers and 5 or 10 satellites.</p><p>Future research will focus on extending this approach to solve rich vehicle problems that occur in city logistics or other multi-tiered systems. An important issue is time dependency and the synchronization of visits from the first and second-level vehicles at the satellites. the number of depots, n, the number of customers, m 1 and m 2 , the number of the first-and second-level vehicles, and K 1 and K 2 , the capacity level for the first and the second level, respectively.
