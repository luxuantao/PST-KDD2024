<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>also contains a large bibliography.) The &amp;", filtering problem for samplea-data systems does not appear to have been investigated so far in the literature. (Results on minimum variance filtering for sampled-data systems and applications may be found in [HI, 661 and the references therein.) Our work on the x control problem is closely related to the work on Xm optimal control of sampled-data systems by <ref type="bibr">Bamieh and Pearson [l]</ref>, BaSar <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, Bagar and I. INTRODUCTION HE subject of this paper is filtering and control T for sampled-data systems. Consider a continuous-time linear time-invariant plant and suppose we are given only sampled output measurements at discrete instants of time.</p><p>We investigate the problem of designing controllers/filters for the continuous-time plant that satisfy given performance requirements. The &amp;", performance requirements are defined directly in terms of the continuous-time signals and thus take intersample behavior into account. For example, in the filtering problem, the filter is required to produce a continuous-time estimate of a given linear function of the continuous-time system state and the resulting system is required satisfy a given bound on the induced norm of the operator mapping the continuous-time process noise and the discrete-time measurement noise to the continuous-time filtering error. Similarly, in the control problem, the controller is required to provide a given level of attenuation on the effect of the continuous-time exogenous disturbance signals and the discrete-time measurement noise on the continuous-time controlled outputs. These problems are motivated by a need to develop a theory of digital control that deals with intersample behavior explicitly.</p><p>This work is related to the recent work in control of sampled-data systems as well as state-space Xm control theory. A number of papers have appeared recently that deal with robust and optimal control of sampled-data systems. (See the recent survey paper by <ref type="bibr">Francis [9]</ref> which <ref type="bibr">Bemhard [3]</ref>, Bemhard 141, Chen and Francis [71, <ref type="bibr">Hara and Kabamba [lo]</ref>, Tadmor <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Toivonen [27]</ref>. However, there is one major difference between our work and all of these papers with the notable exceptioys <ref type="bibr">[21, [41, [26]</ref>: in most of these papers, it is assumed that the controller is a discrete-time linear time-invariant system with a given and fixed, most often a zero order, hold function. We do not make this assumption. The only assumption is that the filter/controller is a causal system. This has some interesting consequences that will be discussed later in this Introduction.</p><p>Taking a state-space approach, we give solutions to a number of x filtering and control problems. In each case, we give necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a causal filter/controller satisfying a specified</p><p>x performance requirement. These necessary and sufficient conditions are in terms of the existence of solutions to matrix (algebraic or differential) Riccati equations. If these solutions exist, then we give formulae for filters/controllers that satisfy the given Z m performance requirement. Our approach draws upon the previous work in state-space &amp;", filtering and control theory <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[41, [81, [131-[161, [19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>, [251, <ref type="bibr">[281, [29]</ref> and the references cited there. Our results generalize the results of <ref type="bibr">Bemhard [41,</ref><ref type="bibr">BaSar and Bemhard [3]</ref> who have obtained similar results in the finite horizon case by using a game-theoretic approach. Tadmor <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26]</ref> has also obtained some results which are somewhat related to our results. Our solutions to the &amp;", control/filtering problem for easily computed by solving two (one) algebraic Riccati equations which are given directly in terms of the problem data. The generalized hold function depends on the system matrices as well as the % performance bound. Thus, once the &amp;", performance bound y is fixed (as close to the optimal performance as desired), one can assume that the controller is a discrete-time linear time-invariant system followed by the hold function as given by our results without loss of generality. Thus, in this specific sense, the hold function is y suboptimal. This is in contrast to the most of the existing work on x control of sampled-data systems where the hold function is kept fixed and the controller is assumed to be a discrete-time linear timeinvariant system. There is another major difference between our results and those in [l], <ref type="bibr">[lo], and [27]</ref>. In [l], <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, and [271 the sampled-data control problem is solved by transforming the problem into an equivalent discrete-time &amp;", con- troller design problem for a suitably constructed discretetime plant. By contrast, our solution is given directly in terms of the given continuous-time plant data. Indeed, the matrix Riccati equations are given explicitly in terms of the plant system matrices and no transformations are needed. Moreover, the Riccati equations are related in a very natural way to the solution in the standard continuous-time case [81.</p><p>While we have formulated these results in the context of Z control, they have immediate applications in robust control of sampled-data systems. Using the recent results on robust stability analysis of sampled-data systems <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>, one can use these results for robust stabilization of linear continuous-time systems with norm bounded unstructured uncertainty.</p><p>The organization of the paper is as follows: in the next section, we will introduce some elementary properties of linear systems with jumps. These may be regarded as a general framework for dealing with hybrid systems, although we will not focus on this aspect in this paper. We will present results on filtering problems in Section 111, control problems in Section IV. The remainder of the paper will be devoted to the proofs. This organization should optimize the readability of the paper.</p><p>The results of this paper were presented at the 1991 International Symposium on the Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems and the 1991 American Control Conference. A brief conference version of this paper has appeared in 1241.</p><p>We end this introduction with some remarks on the notation most of which is standard: 9 denotes the set of real numbers, 9" denotes the n dimensional Euclidean space (identified with n x 1 vectors of real numbers), and P X m denotes the set of all n x m real matrices. We will use A' to denote the transpose of the matrix A, p(A) := maxi Ihi(A)I the spectral radius, and h,,,(A) the maximum eigenvalue of a symmetric real matrix A ~9~'".</p><p>The following norms will be used: llqll := (E; I q12)1/2 for r) â‚¬9'"; IlAll := a,,,(A) (the maximum singular value), for A ~5%""'~; <ref type="bibr">IlfIl[a,bl :</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= (l,bllf(t)ll' dt)l/' if f is func- tion of t E [ a , b1; I I ~I I ~~, ~) := ( x ~~~.

We will write IlfIl[a,b~ (or l l f l l ~a , ~~) as llfll when a = 0 and b = 03. For simplicity, we will assume a uniform sampling rate, i.e., h is a fixed sampling period. For a matrix or vector function f(t) which is right continuous and may be left discontinuous, we use f(ih-) to denote the value of f(t) just before ih, i.e., f(ih-) := lime, o, ~ f(ih -E ) assuming that the limit exists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">DEFINITIONS AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we will discuss the notion of a linear system with finite discrete jumps. It turns out that the solutions to the filtering and control problems treated in this paper have this structure. We will define notions of stability, stabilizability, and detectability for such systems. The proofs will be omitted here for the brevity. Proofs may be found in [231.</p><p>Consider the system of equations where i is an integer. The matrix functions A(t), B(t), C ( t ) are assumed to be piecewise continuous and bounded, and Ad(ih), Bd(ih), Cd(ih) are assumed to be bounded.</p><p>Here x ( t ) is the state vector, u(t) and y ( t ) are continuous-time inputs and outputs to, the system while and yd(ih) are discrete-time inputs and outputs. For a given initial state, the solution x ( t ) to (2.1) is unique, right continuous but may be left discontinuous with possibly finite jumps at t = ih. Both standard continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems are special cases of linear systems with jumps. Simply note that setting Ad =I, Bd = 0, c d = 0 results in a continuous-time system, while setting A = 0, B = 0, C = 0 leads to a discrete-time system.</p><p>Next consider the unforced system Zj with U = 0, U d = 0.

The weighting matrix R is a measure of the relative importance of the uncertainty due to the unknown initial conditions xo. The larger the R, the smaller is the uncertainty in x(0) relative to the uncertainty in w, U. It is easy to see for a given filter F t h a t J 2 J,. For simplicity but without loss of generality the terms z -2, w , v are not weighted in the performance measure. Such weightings can be easily introduced to perform trade-offs, e.g., measurement noise versus process noise.</p><p>Our task is to design a causal filter 9 to estimate z ( t ) which minimizes J(F) [or J 0 ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) ] .

It also has an intuitively appealing structure. In between the sampling instants, the state estimate evolves according to the plant dynamics (with w = 0). At the sampling instants, the measurement y(ih) is used to update the estimate. This update is a linear function of the "innovation" y(ih) -Hi(ih-) with the filter gain being Q(ih)H'. The filtering Riccati equation is also a system with finite jumps at discrete instants of time. In between the sampling instants, the filtering Riccati equation is a Riccati differential equation quite similar to the standard filtering Riccati differential equation [16] with the measurement matrix equal to zero. This is because there is no continuous time measurement. The filtering Riccati equation undergoes a jump at the sampling instant ih with the amount of jump directly affected by the measurement matrix H.</p><p>Since the system is linear time-invariant, in the infinite horizon zero initial state case, one may expect that a time-invariant filter also exists. This does not appear to be the case, since the sampling operation introduces a periodic time-varying aspect to the system. However, a stu- tionaly filter does exist. This filter has many other interesting structural properties which will be discussed after the statement of the result.</p><p>Theorem 3.2: Consider the system described by (3.043.3).

Now suppose such a real symmetric matrix Qo exists. Then the resulting filter F Q 0 has the special structure of a discretetime linear time-invariant filter (3.8) with filter gain QoH' followed by a generalized hold function. The state estimate in between the sampling instants is given by the generalized hold function CeA' acting on most recent state estimate at a sampling instant. Note that it is not assumed that a filter with this particular structure exists. The theorem implies that if there miss any stable causal filter satisjjtng the Z performance requirement, then there also exists a filter having the structure of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system followed by a particular hold function.</p><p>In the filtering case, the hold function depends on the system matrices but is independent of the performance bound y. This is in significant contrast with the situation in the case of Z control as will be seen in the next section.</p><p>Finally, (3.6) with the constraint (3.7) for the real symmetric matrix Qo is equivalent to a discrete algebraic Riccati equation. In fact, routine matrix manipulations show that</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">t E [ i h , ( i + O h ) m[ Lo] = [ I 0 H'H I ][ ;O]Sp (3.9)</formula><p>where S, = ( I + H'HQo)-'(IIll(h) + IIl,(h)Qo) has all its eigenvalues inside the open unit disk. Thus, Qo is the unique stabilizing solution of discrete algebraic Riccati equation (3.9) and can be readily computed using standard numerical techniques [ 171.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that as y tends to infinity, the filters given in the above theorems tend to the minimal variance filters [ l l ] . </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">1 y(ih) = Hx(ih) + u(ih)</formula><p>where w ( t ) E ~' "</p><p>is the exogenous (or disturbance) input, u(t) EST is the control input, and x ( t )</p><p>is the state of the system.

The constant matrices A, B, E, C, D, and H are of compatible dimensions.</p><p>We will make the following standard as.umptions: All The discrete-time system (eAh, B, H ) is stabiliz-</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">A21 The continuous-time system (A, E, C) is stabiliz- A3) D'[C Dl = [O I ] .</formula><p>able and detectable.</p><p>able and detectable.</p><p>(Recall, 5 was defined in the previous section. These assumptions can be relaxed further as is well known in the standard Z control literature. See, e.g., [20] and the references cited there.)</p><p>The Z control problem we address in this paper is that of designing a causal controller 3 which uses the sampled measurements y(ih) and reduces the worst case effect of the exogenous signals w, U on the regulated outputs z. To be precise, a controller is a system which takes the sampled output measurements and generates a continuoustime control input signal U. Similarly, a controller 3 is said to be causal if its output only depends on current and past inputs.</p><p>The controller 3 will be required to internally stabilize the system G. Internal stability can be defined in several different ways. For our purposes, it can be taken to mean that for any initial state of the system G, all resulting signals are norm bounded. As a matter of fact, the controllers that we will give yield internal exponential stability in a state-space sense.</p><p>In this paper, the performance of a given controller is measured by a certain worst case Z like performance measure. Following the formulation in [14], [28], we will treat the following two cases: The performance measure J ( Z ) can also be viewed as the induced norm of the linear operator generated by the closed-loop system which maps ( x o , w, U) to 2. More explicitly, consider the operator r: .

Recall that the LZ2 induced norm is the usual Z norm for standard linear time-invariant systems.</p><p>Our task is to design a causal internally stabilizing controller Z which minimizes the worst case performance measures J ( Z ) or J o ( Z ) .

The algebraic Riccati equation for P is the usual fullinformation continuous-time Riccati equation. The algebraic Riccati equation for Q:,, is quite different from the continuous-time case. This structure accurately reflects the nature of the problem. The main difference between the standard continuous-time problem and the problem treated here is in the measurements. This shows up in the difference in the filtering Riccati equation; the control Riccati equation does not change. Now suppose real symmetric matrices P , Q:,, satisfying the various requirements exist. Then one causal controller ZPe;,, which assures Jo &lt; y is a discrete-time linear time-invariant controller (4.4) followed by the generalized hold jimction given by -E'Pe(A+Y-2BB'P-EE'P)r. In contrast to the filtering problem, in this case, the hold function depends on the system matrices as well as the performance requirement y. The hold function is very closely related the standard continuous-time full information controller as in [81. It can be obtained by taking the game strategies U = -E'&amp;, w = y-'B'&amp;. Note that we did not assume that the controller has the structure of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system followed a generalized hold function. Thus, if there exists any causal internally stabilizing controller satisfying the given Z performance requirement then there also exists a discrete-time linear time-invariant controller followed by the generalized hold function <ref type="figure">-E'Pe(A+ r -Z B B ' P -E E ' P</ref> ) t .

Thus, the controller in Theorem 4.2 can be easily computed by solving a pair of algebraic Riccati equations: one continuous-time and one discrete-time.</p><p>J O ( ~P @ , , ) &lt; 7.</p></div>

Similarly, J(G,S") := J(F).</p><p>Consider the system connection shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, where U and G,,, have the following representations:</p><p>Then Q ( t ) := Q,,,(txI + y-2PQt,,(t))-4 , V t 2 0 is well For Theorem 4.2, as in the proof of Theorem 3.2, one can show that in fact</p><p>The rest is similar to the proof above. U VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have solved certain &amp;", filtering and control problems for systems with sampled measurements. Our solutions are given in terms of Riccati algebraic/differential equations (with jumps). We do not assume that the control is applied through a zero order or a given hold. In fact, our result generates the "optimal" hold function(s) from the problem data. The controllers can be computed by solving one continuous-time and one discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation. Our solution also shares many qualitative properties with the standard X solution. For example, the controller has the structure of an &amp;", estimator for the full information control law in the presence of the worst disturbance. Indeed, the technical novelty lies in the filtering problem since the fullinformation control law does not depend on the sampled-data nature of the problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>0</head><label></label><figDesc>Initial State xo is Unknown: Consider the worst case closed-loop performance measure J ( 3 ) defined as where the supremum is taken over all w E~F[O, CO), U E l$'(O,~), and xo such that l l ~1 1 ~ + llu1I2 + xbRro .f 0.
