<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Feature types play a crucial role in understanding and analyzing geographic information. Usually, these types are defined, standardized, and controlled by domain experts and cover geographic features on the mesoscale level, e.g., populated places, forests, or lakes. While feature types also underlie most Location-Based Services (LBS), assigning a consistent typing schema for Points Of Interest (POI) across different data sets is challenging. In case of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), types are assigned as tags by a heterogeneous community with different backgrounds and applications in mind. Consequently, VGI research is shifting away from data completeness and positional accuracy as quality measures towards attribute accuracy. As tags can be assigned by everybody and have no formal or stable definition, we propose to study category tags via indirect observations. We extract user check-ins from massive real-world data crawled from Location-based Social Networks to understand the temporal dimension of Points Of Interest. While users may assign different category tags to places, we argue that their temporal characteristics, e.g., opening times, will show distinguishable patterns.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION</head><p>As argued by Harnad cognition is categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>. Our behavior towards different types of entities varies based on what they afford <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>. Categorization itself does not require language, but assigning terms to categories plays a major role in communication. However, as we cannot compare categories in our minds directly and also assign different labels to them, our understanding of terms differs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>. While addressed in everyday life by situated simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, defining the meaning of domain vocabulary is among the main challenges for interoperability, information re-usage and retrieval, as well as recommendation systems.</p><p>Ontologies specified using formal knowledge representation languages are a promising approach to restrict the interpretation of terms towards their intended meaning and have a long tradition in GIScience <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18]</ref>. While several methodologies and tools have been introduced over the last years, ontology engineering is a difficult task. It requires a common agreement among domain experts and a deep understanding of the logics-based knowledge representation languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. INSPIRE<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , for instance, provides an interesting example for the difficulties arising when trying to arrive at a common and formal agreement for the definition of mesoscale feature types, e.g., rivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. The need for richer semantic annotations to improve information retrieval has recently been acknowledged by Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft by launching their common schema.org platform.</p><p>Feature types also play a crucial role for Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), e.g., for projects such as Open-StreetMap. These projects often maintain a semi-formal vocabulary with dozens or even hundreds of feature types 2 . The categorization of Points of Interest (POI) is especially difficult for several reasons. For instance, a single building can accommodate several different types of stores, those can change frequently over time, and offer multiple functionality. ATMs are a typical example discussed in the OpenStreetMap community. For instance, many post offices or banks are annotated as ATMs, i.e., taxonomic and partonomic relations are confused. The OSM community proposed to use the combination of amenity=bank and atm=yes as workaround. Pubs and bars are another example and led to the introduction of the similar features list in the OSM wiki. While the need for ontological definitions of such feature types is largely acknowledged and may not only benefit retrieval but also data cleaning and integration, attempts to develop POI ontologies have failed so far.</p><p>Approaches which try to make a heterogeneous and global community agree on definitions for types, e.g., Bar or Bank, by defining them in terms of walls, tables, menus, or guests are not likely to be successful. A narrow definition of Bar would exclude many places that locals perceive as bars, while too broad definitions would fail to distinguish Bar from other feature types such as Café. Based on our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>, we propose to study massive real-world data from Location-based Social Networks (LBSN) to extract ontological primitives out of user behavior. These primitives do not define bars in terms of walls or tables, but their temporal characteristics, e.g., whether they are weekend or weekday locations, visited during daytime or in the evening. In this study, and complementary to our previous work on the semantic annotation of POIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>, we are not interested in finding suitable tags for untagged POIs but in finding unique temporal characteristics for feature types. Together with our work on Spatial-Semantic Interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>, we aim at introducing Semantic Signatures as analogy to spectral signatures from remote sensing. Similarly to multiple spectral bands, these signatures can combine spatial, temporal, and thematic bands, and thereby identify feature types bottomup. In other words, we use space and time as fundamental ordering principles for knowledge organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The remaining paper is structured as follows. First, we introduce Location-based Social Networks and Volunteered Geographic Information in more detail. We point out how we applied them in previous work to mine for spatial and temporal patterns. Next, we introduce our approach to Temporal-Semantic Interaction, present the used data, and discuss new measures. We then outline how our work can be applied for tag recommendation, place selection, and data cleaning -all of them being major challenges for LBSN and VGI. To do so, we point out how algorithms could use our findings and show brief examples for each case. Finally, we summarize our work and highlight directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK</head><p>This section reviews works necessary for the understanding of our research. While we will use category tags from LBSN as feature types, one has to keep in mind that volunteers do not follow rigid typing schemata. Hence, partonomic, taxonomic, and activity-related terms may be mixed. In order to stay as close as possible to the real data (and the labeling used by the community), we will use the terms feature type and category tags interchangeably. However, we will refer to activity related tags, e.g., cocktail, as category tags.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Location-based Social Networks</head><p>Geography and especially location play an increasing role in social online networks such as Facebook, Foursquare, or Whrrl, and have been analyzed in several studies <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35]</ref>. Work on feature types in Location-based Social Networks was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20]</ref>, where <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> exploited the regularity of user behaviors in LBSN to assign category tags to untagged places, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> explored the place naming preferences of users in Location-based Social Networks.</p><p>Facebook researchers analyzed the distance between the users' social relations, and utilized locations of friends to predict the geographic location of specific users <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Cheng et al., modeled the spatial distribution of words in Tweets to predict the user's location <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Characterizing network properties in relation to local geography is studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>. The behavior of users with respect to the location-field in their Twitter profiles has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>. How and why people use location-sharing services and the privacy issues related to those services have been discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31]</ref>. Finally, applications such as place recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">38]</ref>, content delivery services <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>, and friend recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref> have been proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Volunteered Geographic Information</head><p>Volunteered Geographic Information <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref> describes the phenomenon of volunteers contributing geographic data and making them accessible under an open license. Projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> or Wikimapia<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> provide platforms to publish and access VGI. Tags, representing feature types in VGI, are much more volatile than their counterparts defined by professional authorities. They are subject to frequent changes that emerge from informal discussions within the VGI community. Their usage is largely based on individual experience, cognition, as well as the used tagging and rendering software. So far, most research on VGI has focused on data completeness and positional accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23]</ref>. Assessing data quality with respect to non-spatial attributes and especially feature types is difficult as reference data is missing. The methods to determine that a certain POI tagged as Café is semantically less accurate than another POI marked as Bar if both are, in fact, identified as Nightclub are largely missing <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>. Additionally, this would require a ground truth feature type. Our work aims at setting the ground for such a semantic measurement framework.</p><p>Studying feature type definitions in OSM <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> , shows that there is no explicit account for time. The key-value pair based formalization of types only distinguishes between, for example, amenities and shops on the higher level, and bars and cafés on the lower level. Temporal references are rare and can only be found on the informal description pages. For instance they are used to highlight regional differences:</p><p>In Mediterranean countries, the word "bar" has a different meaning [...] You go there in the morning to have breakfast, at lunch they serve simple meals, all day long (if not closed after lunch) people use them to get a quick coffee and in the evening it's a meeting place to get an apéritif before dinner. 6   Without a more formal approach to temporal aspects, VGI cannot be used for place recommendations. The above example also indicates that regional differences matter and should be accounted for.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Spatial-Semantic Interaction</head><p>The spatial bands of semantic signatures, i.e., defining what you are by where you are, is equally important as the temporal bands introduced in this paper. However, both aspects differ substantially. Of most relevance for our work is the cyclicality of time in contrast to space, i.e., periods play a major role in our perception of time. In our everyday lives, we refer to discrete and reoccurring partitions of time, e.g., evening, weekend, or New Year. In contrast, space cannot be partitioned in such a way. Consequently, the above formulation has to be rephrased as what you are is where you are with regard to other geographic features. Spatial-Semantic Interaction models this relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>. Other features types are not included explicitly as categorical variables but implicitly through a similarity measure. Thereby, it is possible to apply statistical measures such as concept variograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> or variations of Diggle's D0 statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.  The z-value is interpreted as the likelihood of features of type Bar to co-occur with other features (of various types) within a certain semantic and spatial range. Up to a distance of 300 meters and an inter-type similarity value of 0.5, a significant clustering can be observed. In other words, bars tend to co-occur with other bars or features of similar types, e.g., nightclubs, within a close proximity. These two thresholds (space and type similarity) 6 http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity=bar strongly vary among feature types and, therefore, can be used as one band for unique semantic signatures. Together with the temporal bands discussed in this paper, they can be employed to disambiguate feature types. Ontological primitives such as clumped or regularly distributed on the spatial side, and evening, weekend, or weekday on the temporal side can be computed and used to construct data driven, bottomup POI ontologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. Application areas will be discussed in section 4 in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">STUDYING TEMPORAL-SEMANTIC INTERACTION</head><p>In this section, we introduce the crawled data, discuss the weekly and daily temporal bands, as well as a notion of semantic feature type similarity derived from the check-in behavior of users in Location-based Social Networks. Finally, we compare the temporal patterns using a measure inspired by classical point-pattern analysis. Our study aims at demonstrating that a behavioristic approach can be used to discriminate types of places by observing user activities; see also the algebraic approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>. For instance, the crawled check-in patterns to colleges differs significantly from those for cocktail-related places. Hence, our work can serve as basis for various services by predicting the type of an untagged place based on the check-in time of a specific user. With respect to the example above, a untagged POI visited regularly during the evening on weekends is most likely not a college. In this work, we focus solely on temporal aspectsthe targeted semantic signatures will combine spatial, temporal, and thematic bands.</p><p>We conduct our research based on a dataset crawled from the Whrrl<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">7</ref> platform in spring 2011. Whrrl was a representative Location-based Social Network and the first to display check-in times, i.e., the timestamps of users entering a certain place. Meanwhile, Whrrl has been acquired by Groupon. Further popular LBSN include Foursquare, Gowalla, or Facebook Place. However, they do not offer access to the temporal data required for this study. We have used two kinds of data, the feature types of places as well as their check-in times. During crawling Whrrl for one month, we extracted 35,745 users and their 440,939 check-in activities to 150,300 different places; see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of users 35,745 Number of places 150,300 Number of check-ins 440,939 Number of tags 408</head><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Data crawled from Whrll in spring 2011.</p><p>From those places, we extracted 408 unique category tags, such as restaurant, shop, or bar used for feature typing. It turns out that types are not uniformly represented in Location-based Social Networks. POIs with tags related to dining, food, shopping, and nightlife are the most frequently checked-in places; about 74% of all check-ins are related to them. This observation confirms our common sense about daily life and also the kind of data that users make public.</p><p>Intuitively, people would like to share their experience about   <ref type="figure">3</ref>, people interact with places frequently at around noon and in the evening. Most activities happen between 9am and 11pm, with two peaks at around 1pm and 7pm. This is due to the fact that most check-ins are related to restaurants and food. The check-ins mirror the daily lunch and dinner cycles. A related observation can be made for the weekly data.</p><p>As activities related to dining, shopping, and nightlife are over-represented in the data, we find the highest volume of check-ins on Fridays and Saturdays; see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Overall, we could not find evidence for distortions in our data as they would be expected for highly specialized user communities, e.g., a low number on check-ins during weekdays or high activities during late evenings.     </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Temporal Band</head><p>The primary goal of the presented work is to understand geographic feature types based on how, i.e., when, people interact with places of those types. For instance, as discussed above, people usually go to restaurants at around noon and in the evening for lunch and dinner, respectively; while they visit nightclubs during the late evening or night. We argue that by analyzing the check-in pattern for a specific place, we can make predictions about its type. We will call methods to study the temporal dimension of types Temporal-Semantic Interaction and name different temporal pattern as temporal bands. While we have shown that temporal data can be successfully applied to automatically learn feature types for untagged places <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>, we do not argue that one or more temporal bands will always be enough to distinguish feature types. To compute unique semantic signature may require additional bands such as those extracted from analyzing Spatial-Semantic Interaction; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> plots the weekly check-in patterns to three different category tags: cocktail, college and party. As can be seen, cocktail related places are visited during the whole week; however, they are most frequently visited during the weekend. For instance, within one month of crawling, we collected more than twice as many check-ins on Fridays compared to Mondays. We have observed similar distributions for other category tags as well, e.g., for the tags Bars and Beer. It is important to keep in mind that category tags assigned by volunteers differ from feature typing schemata of professional authorities. The tag cocktail simply describes those types of Points Of Interest that serve cocktails.</p><p>In contrast to the feature types discussed above, places tagged as college show a significant check-in decay during the weekend, i.e., they are weekday features. Moreover, we can also observe a drop on Fridays which is well known by faculty members teaching on this weekday. Places tagged by party do not show such significant patterns. While Saturdays are preferred and the lowest number of check-ins takes place on Sunday and Monday, the distribution rather indicates that users also tagged private apartments with party, e.g., for a birthday party (which can take place during every day of the week). This example demonstrates that a single band, in this case the weekly band, may not be sufficient to identify unique patterns for each feature type.</p><p>Therefore, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> adds the daily check-in patterns for the three category tags. Users visit places tagged with cocktail in the late evening, typically after 6pm. In contrast, they check-in at colleges during the typical working hours, i.e., from 9am to 6pm. As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6c</ref>, party related check-ins take place during the evening, while almost no check-ins can be observed in the morning. While the number of total check-ins is low for the party tag in general, the daily band demonstrates how multiple bands can be used if a single temporal band does not provide enough discriminatory power. Hence, we argue that multiple temporal bands can be combined to provide a robust and meaningful descrip-tions of different geographic feature types.</p><p>Finally, while we only investigate the daily and weekly temporal bands here, other bands can be generated from from seasonal or and even yearly data. However, as our crawling covers only one month, we do not explore these bands in our work. Bands can also be combined, e.g., using kernel density estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Semantic Similarity</head><p>Typically, geographic feature types have been defined intensionally, i.e., by necessary and sufficient conditions for membership. While more expressive, this approach faces the problems introduced in section 1. It is unlikely, that a global and highly heterogeneous community will agree on a set of characteristics for types such as Bar or College. Studying the check-in data from Location-based Social Networks, we have the opportunity to provide an alternative, extensional approach. We propose to learn the semantics of different feature types, by taking advantages of massive user behaviorin this study, their check-ins. However, the lack of declarative knowledge asks for alternative approaches to reasoning as well. To implement recommendation systems, data cleaning, or to integrate data from heterogeneous sources, and as argued in section 2, we need measures for the proximity of types. In this section, we devise a new semantic dissimilarity function for geographic feature types, measured based on the differences of temporal bands.</p><p>Let G = {g1, g2, ...} denote the domain of geographic feature types, where is |G| = 408 corresponds to the number of different category tags in our dataset. The temporal band of geographic feature type gi ∈ G is denoted by tbi. Note that in order to ease the computation of semantic dissimilarity, we propose to unify all the temporal bands of different geographic feature types, i.e., the temporal band is transformed into a probability density function (called normalized temporal band here). For example, given a geographic feature type gi, the normalized daily temporal band is present as <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24</ref> , where 24 j=1 pi,j = 1 and pi,j(≥ 0) is proportional to the frequency of check-ins to the geographic features of type gi at hour j th . Similarly, we get the normalized weekly temporal band of geographic feature type gi ∈ G as tb w i = pi,1, pi,2, • • • , pi,7 , where 7 j=1 pi,j = 1 and pi,j(≥ 0) is proportional to the frequency of check-ins to the geographic features of type gi at day j th of a week.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">tb d i = pi,1, pi,2, • • • , pi,</formula><p>The semantic dissimilarity function is denoted by dis-sim(gi, gj) (gi, gj ∈ G) and defined as follows; see 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>dis-sim(gi, gj) = d(tbi, tbj)</head><p>(</p><p>where d(•, •) denote a function to measure the distance between two probability distribution, i.e., tbi and tbj.</p><p>There are several candidate measures for such distance function, e.g., Kullback-Leibler divergence, Hellinger distance, Total Variation Distance, Energy Distance, or Bhattacharyya distance. Among them, Kullbak-leibler divergence and Hellinger distance are non-symmetric, while the analysis in this paper requires a symmetric semantic dissimilarity function, i.e., dis-sim(gi, gj) = dis-sim(gj, gi). We have tested Total Variation Distance, Energy Distance, and Bhattacharyya distance, and found that their results are very close with respect to our data. We will use Total Variation Distance in our study; see Equation <ref type="formula">2</ref>.</p><p>dis-sim(gi, gj) = 1 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">|tb| k=1 |p i,k -p j,k | (2)</formula><p>For example, if we have two temporal bands tb1 = 0.3, 0.4, 0.3 and tb2 = 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 , then the dissimilarity between g1 and g2 is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 2 (|0.3 -0.2| + |0.4 -0.3| + |0.3 -0.5|) = 0.2.</formula><p>Whether temporal bands can be used to compute semantic dissimilarity between two feature types depends on the robustness of those bands. More specifically, the fact that Friday 11pm is close to Saturday 1am is not modeled in our approach so far. Consequently, we have to take the circularity of the temporal dimension into account to derive an appropriate dissimilarity measure. Therefore, we propose a smoothing function based on a classical moving-window and kernel approach that operates on the original temporal band and transforms it in to a more robust form. For instance, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> depicts a part of a weekly temporal band together with a 3-cell window and the kernel 0.5, 1.0, 0.5 . The central weight of the window is usually defined as 1, and the adjacent weight define the degree of smoothing. Higher values increase the impact of the neighboring days or hours, respectively. Smoothing is achieved by moving the window step-by-step (i.e., day-byday or hour-by-hour) to determine the new value for the center cell. For example, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, the new value for Sunday is the weighted sum of the original temporal band after applying the kernel weights. As depicted, the smoothed value is (5 × 0.5) + (7 × 1.0) + (6 × 0.5) = 12.5.</p><p>In the following, we use the geographic feature type stadium for demonstration purpose as it highlights benefits and shortcomings of our approach at the same time. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>  with them at similar times. The Beer tag shows the benefits as well as drawbacks of such an behavioristic approach. Following an intensional approach to ontology engineering, beer (related places) would share no (or just a few) characteristics with stadiums. However, people often go to sports events to drink beer. Therefore, an approach that is based on user behavior is able to capture such hidden relations. To a certain degree, stadiums are beer drinking locations.</p><p>As argued before, a single band may not be able to discriminate feature type which makes the combination of different bands necessary. We only consider temporal bands here. Adding a spatial band improves the rankings by removing dining places from the stadium list due to their different distribution in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows similar geographic feature types, such as Theaters, Baseball, Sports, Arts, Recreation and Entertainment for the weekly band. All these activities/types share a certain weekly pattern with stadiums and have their peaks during weekends.</p><p>In both cases, the smoothed results provide the better results with respect to common sense -as argued above, a gold standard is missing. Combining and grouping the results shows similarities between Stadiums and sports related places (Baseball, Sports, Recreation, Outdoor ) as well as those providing entertainment (Live Performance, Theaters, Entertainment, Museums).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Temporal Analysis of Feature Types</head><p>So far, we discussed how temporal patterns from massive user check-ins can be explored to understand the semantics of category tags assigned for place typing in Locationbased Social Networks. We introduced a moving window based similarity measure using the probabilistic Total Variation Distance to compare individual feature types via their temporal bands. While we will outline how to apply the results to recommendation services and data cleaning in section 4, similarity is restricted to a binary comparison. To understand the relations between different types, we have to analyze their temporal clustering patterns as well.</p><p>We abstract each feature type to a point in a one-dimensional space to reveal whether they are clumped, randomly, or reg- ularly distributed with respect to other, similar types; compare to our spatial analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>. We propose a statistics (called M here) which is inspired by Ripley's spatial pointpattern analysis K <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref>. Note that the space is constructed in a relative way, i.e., we can only compute the dissimilarity score between any two geographic feature types. Therefore, given a target geographic feature type gi ∈ G, the temporalsemantic similarity space can be formed by applying Equation (2) to calculate the dissimilarity scores between gi and any gj ∈ G. For example, given the target feature type cocktail, we compute the corresponding space as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>. Based on the user check-in behavior, the liquor category tag is more similar to cocktail than pubs. Next, we devise a MS i () function to study the resulting clustering patterns in the space Si for the given target feature type gi ∈ G; see Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">MS i (d) = λ -1 ES i (d)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>ES i (d) is the number of points within distance d to the given original point (i.e., the target type) in Si, and λ is the intensity, i.e., the expected number of points in a regular distribution. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>   a more generic activity and can be associated with other activities such as renting a movie, dining, buying electronics, and so forth. In contrast, cocktail is more specific and restricted to nightlife; thus, there are not as many similar geographic feature types. In other words, the patterns generated by cocktail and related category tags are more unique in comparison to the other types; many of them show a distribution in the daily and weekly band that is similar to the one from shopping.</p><p>In the future, we plan to explore methods to discover subsumption relations between feature types to be used in datadriven ontology engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">APPLICATIONS</head><p>Several applications could benefit from the research on Temporal-Semantic Interaction in Location-based Social Networks. For example, service providers could support users with tag and place recommendations. Moreover, data in Location-based Social Networks is volunteered, therefore the data quality is not guaranteed. A better and data-driven understanding of feature types can foster data cleaning, data integration, and on the long term also assist in ontology engineering. As argued before, categorization is a key to decision support and recommendation. In the following, we provide an overview on how our findings could contribute to such services.</p><p>Tag Recommendation. When users check-in at a place, they may want to publish their opinions about this place.</p><p>Tag recommendations can assist users to assign meaningful tags that are already circulated. Common algorithms for tag recommendation are based on the tag usage frequency, i.e. the most frequently used tag ranks at the top. However, based on the additional temporal bands, we can make context, i.e., time, driven tag recommendations. Two examples for new, prototypical recommendation algorithms based on temporal bands are:</p><p>-Temporal Band Similarity. In this algorithm, the feature type that has the most similar temporal band to the checkin temporal band of a given place should be ranked top. Let tb * denote the temporal band of check-ins to a given place, and tbi be the temporal band of check-ins to some specific geographic feature types gi ∈ G. Then gi will be ranked higher if the value of dis-sim(tb * , tbi) is smaller.</p><p>-Check-in Probability Maximization In this case, we exploit the check-in time t of a user to a given place to infer the probability of a category tag to a place, i.e., P r(gi|t).</p><p>P r(gi|t) = P r(t|gi)P r(gi) P r(t) ∝ P r(t|gi)P r(gi) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(4)</ref> where P r(t|gi) can be estimated from the temporal band corresponding to the geographic feature type gi ∈ G, and the prior P r(gi) can be estimated from the raw data. The higher P r(gi|t), the higher the corresponding geographic feature types will be ranked. Place Selection. To improve the usability of mobile Location-based Social Network applications, our work could assist in choosing the user's current place based on the time and weekday. When a user want to check-in to some place, mobile applications usually provide a list of nearby places. So far, these are ranked according to distances as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>. Though distance is a good criteria to rank places, temporal information is also important and instructive to tell where the user may be. Our study can assist in re-ranking the candidate places by considering the temporal band. For example, if a user checks-in at a given place at 1am, we can to rank places with pubs or nightlife tags higher than a nearby grocery store. Note that a place may afford multiple activities and have multiple tags. Formally, we calculate the check-in probability P r(pi|t) to a place pi, given the current time t. The higher P r(pi|t), the higher the corresponding place pi will be ranked.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P r(pi|t) = max</head><formula xml:id="formula_5">gx∈G i P r(gx|t) (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where Gi is the category tag set of place pi, and P r(gx|t) can be estimated according to Equation (4).</p><p>Data Cleaning. A place may be assigned multiple category tags by different people. Since the data is volunteer, noise is very likely, i.e., users may make mistakes when assigning tags to a place. In general, the temporal bands of places of the same (or similar) geographic feature types should be similar as they offer the same activities and share similar time constraints, e.g., opening hours. However, if such places show a very distinctive temporal band, the data may have to be double-checked or cleaned. More formally, given a place pi and its tags gx ∈ Gi ⊂ G, we define the maximum dissimilarity among the tags associated with the place as the clean score (CSi) of the corresponding place,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">CSi = max gx,gy ∈G i {dis-sim(gx, gy)} (6)</formula><p>If CSi exceeds a threshold value θ, we would propose to investigate whether the assigned tags match the place. Larger θ may pass more noisy data; while smaller θ can improve the data quality at the cost of high overhead for data reviewing.</p><p>In the future, we will use a training dataset to learn a proper θ for specific category tag combinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK</head><p>In this paper, we presented a study on the temporal dimension of places and their types in Location-based Social Networks. Starting from the behavioristic assumption that what you are can be determined by when you are, we crawled the Whrrl platform for one month to extract data about users, places, category tags, and check-in timestamps. For each of 408 category tags, we investigated two kinds of patterns, those from differences in the distribution of daily check-in times and those based on weekly differences. We then applied a moving window based smoothing to account for the circularity in temporal data. Next, we introduced a dissimilarity measure to compare feature types based on the different check-in distributions by computing the probabilistic Total Variation Distance. To extend our study beyond binary comparison, we introduce a statistics to visualize the check-in time-based clustering between different geographic feature types.</p><p>The presented work forms one of three pillars, the others being spatial <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref> and thematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, to introduce semantic signatures as a data-driven methodology to uniquely identify and distinguish feature types such as Bar or College.</p><p>In analogy to multiple electromagnetic bands used for spectral signatures in remote sensing, we showed how temporal bands can be defined based on the daily and weekly checkin behavior of Whrrl users. We outline how these bands and the introduced measures can be used for application areas such as tag recommendation, place selection, and data cleaning -all of them being major challenges in research on Location-based Social Networks, Volunteered Geographic Information, and Mobile Spatial Decision Support Systems. We also argued that our methodology can be used to derive ontological primitives that are directly extracted from observations, i.e., user behavior. These primitives could be used to define places based on whether they are weekend, weekday, evening, or daytime places, instead of defining them in terms of common characteristics such as walls, tables, chairs, or menus. This work directly contributes to our work on Spatial-Semantic-Interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>. Nevertheless, it is important to note that we do not aim at replacing intensional, declarative ontology engineering but propose to combine topdown with bottom-up approaches. Research on geographic ontology design patterns will be required to compose such ontologies out of observation-based primitives.</p><p>Temporal-Semantic-Interaction can only set the ground for further research and a lot of work remains to be done. So far, we have not decided on how to combine multiple spatial, temporal, and thematic bands to form the envisioned semantic signatures. Moreover, while we have outlined how our work supports the introduced application areas, these services need to be implemented and tested with human participants. While we envision to use our findings for data cleaning in the future, our own bands require cleaning as well. Volunteered Geographic Information contains noise, is highly heterogeneous, and inconsistent. In this study, we deliberately used unfiltered data<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">8</ref> to demonstrate the necessity of multiple bands and smoothing. However, often we had to rely on common sense as there are no reference sets or gold standards for non-spatial attributes in VGI. In fact, our work is intended to set the ground and provide measures for further studies. It can assist in answering the question whether a dataset declaring a feature as Bar is more or less semantically accurate than another dataset tagging the same location with Nightclub, while, according to ground truth, it is of type Restaurant. Therefore, the proposed measures are a way to investigate semantic accuracy in addition to feature completeness and positional accuracy studied so far. This will require to further semantify geostatistics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Spatial semantic interaction of bars in London computed from Open Street Map data; based on [24].</figDesc><graphic coords="3,53.26,354.34,243.17,199.73" type="bitmap" /></figure>
