<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), which allows the membership degree of an element to a set represented by several possible values, is considered as a powerful tool to express uncertain information in the process of multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems. In this paper, we develop a novel approach based on TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and the maximizing deviation method for solving MADM problems, in which the evaluation information provided by the decision maker is expressed in hesitant fuzzy elements and the information about attribute weights is incomplete. There are two key issues being addressed in this approach. The first one is to establish an optimization model based on the maximizing deviation method, which can be used to determine the attribute weights. According to the idea of the TOPSIS of Hwang and Yoon [1], the second one is to calculate the relative closeness coefficient of each alternative to the hesitant positive-ideal solution, based on which the considered alternatives are ranked and then the most desirable one is selected. An energy policy selection problem is used to illustrate the detailed implementation process of the proposed approach, and demonstrate its validity and applicability. Finally, the extended results in interval-valued hesitant fuzzy situations are also pointed out.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Multi-attribute decision making (MADM), which addresses the problem of making an optimal choice that has the highest degree of satisfaction from a set of alternatives that are characterized in terms of their attributes, is a usual task in human activities. In classical MADM, the assessments of alternatives are precisely known <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. However, because of the inherent vagueness of human preferences as well as the objects being fuzzy and uncertain, the attributes involved in decision making problems are not always expressed in real numbers, and some are better suited to be denoted by fuzzy values, such as interval values <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, linguistic variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, intuitionistic fuzzy values <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, just to mention a few. Since Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> first proposed the basic model of fuzzy decision making based on the theory of fuzzy mathematics in 1965, fuzzy MADM has been receiving more and more attention. Many methods for MADM, such as the TOPSIS method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the maximizing deviation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the gray relational analysis method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organisation METHod for Enrichment Evaluations) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and the ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, have been extended to take different types of attribute values into account, such as interval values, linguistic variables, and intuitionistic fuzzy values. All of the above methods, however, have not yet been accommodated to fit the hesitant fuzzy assessments provided by the decision makers (DMs).</p><p>Hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, which has been introduced by Torra and Narukawa as an extension of fuzzy set <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, describes the situations that permit the membership of an element to a given set having a few different values, which is a useful means to describe and deal with uncertain information in the process of MADM. For example, to get a reasonable decision result, a decision organization, which contains a lot of DMs, is authorized to estimate the degree that an alternative should satisfy a criterion. Suppose that there are three cases, some DMs provide 0.3, some provide 0.5, and the others provide 0.6, and these three parts cannot persuade each other, thus the degree that the alternative should satisfy the criterion can be represented by a HFE {0.3, 0.5, 0.6}. It is noted that the HFE {0.3, 0.5, 0.6} can describe the above situation more objectively than the interval-value fuzzy set [0.3, 0.6], because the degrees that the alternative should satisfy the criterion are not the convex combination of 0.3 and 0.6, or the interval between 0.3 and 0.6, but just three possible values <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. So, the use of hesitant fuzzy assessments makes the DMs' judgments more reliable and informative in decision making. Xia and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> developed some aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy information, and gave their application for solving MADM problems under hesitant fuzzy environment. Xu and Xia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> gave a detailed study on distance and similarity measures for HFSs and proposed an approach based on distance measures for MADM problems. Xia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> also proposed some other hesitant fuzzy aggregation techniques and applied them in group decision making. Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> proposed a hesitant fuzzy Choquet integral operator and applied it in MADM under hesitant fuzzy environment in which the weight vector of attributes is exactly known. Wei <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> also developed some prioritized aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy information, and developed some models for hesitant fuzzy MADM problems in which the attributes are in different priority levels. Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposed the generalized hesitant fuzzy Bonferroni mean to solve MAGDM problems where the attributes are correlative under hesitant fuzzy environment. More recently, Qian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> generalized the HFSs using intuitionistic fuzzy sets in group decision making framework. The generalized HFS is fit for the situations when the DMs have a hesitation among several possible memberships under uncertainty. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> also generalized the concept of HFS to that of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set (IVHFS) in which the membership degrees of an element to a given set are not exactly defined, but denoted by several possible interval values, and meanwhile developed an approach to group decision making based on interval-valued hesitant preference relations in order to consider the differences of opinions between individual DMs. Obviously, most of these papers put their emphasis on the extensions of the aggregation techniques in MADM under hesitant fuzzy scenarios. However, when using these techniques, the associated weighting vector is more or less determined subjectively and the decision information itself is not taken into consideration sufficiently; and more importantly, a significant pitfall of the aforementioned methods is the need for the information about attribute weights being exactly known.</p><p>In fact, in the process of MADM with hesitant fuzzy information, we often encounter the situations where the attribute values take the form of HFEs, and the information about attribute weights is incompletely known or completely unknown because of time pressure, lack of knowledge or data, and the expert's limited expertise about the problem domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Considering that the existing methods cannot be suitable for dealing with such situations, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to objectively determine the attribute weights and sort the alternatives under the conditions that the attribute weights are completely unknown or partly known, and the attribute values take the form of HFEs. To do so, we organize the paper as follows: In Section 2, we review some concepts related to HFSs and IVHFSs. Section 3 develops a novel approach based on TOPSIS and the maximizing deviation method for solving the MADM problem with hesitant fuzzy information. Section 4 extends our results to interval-valued hesitant fuzzy environment. Section 5 gives the application of the developed approach to MADM involving energy policy selection and makes some comparison analysis. The paper finishes with some concluding remarks in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Some basic concepts</head><p>Hesitant fuzzy set <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, as a generalization of fuzzy set, permits the membership degree of an element to a set presented as several possible values between 0 and 1, which can better describe the situations where people have hesitancy in providing their preferences over objects in the process of decision making. Definition 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. Let X be a reference set, a hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) A on X is defined in terms of a function h A (x) when applied to X returns a subset of [0, 1], i.e.,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A ¼ f&lt; x; h A ðxÞ &gt; jx 2 Xg ð 1Þ</head><p>where h A (x) is a set of some different values in [0, 1], representing the possible membership degrees of the element x 2 X to A. For the sake of simplicity, Xia and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> called h A (x) a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE).</p><p>It is noted that the number of values for different HFEs may be different, and the values are usually out of order, then we can arrange them in any order for convenience. Suppose that we arrange the values of a HFE h in an increasing order, and let h r(i) (i = 1, 2, . . . , l h ) be the ith smallest value in h. For two HFEs a and b, let l = max{l a , l b }, where l a and l b are respectively the numbers of values in the HFEs a and b. In order to more accurately calculate the distance between two HFSs, Xu and Xia <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> suggested that we should extend the shorter one until both of them have the same length when we compare them with l a -l b , and they gave the following regulations: If l a &lt; l b , then a should be extended by adding the minimal value in it until it has the same length with b; If l a &gt; l b , then b should be extended by adding the minimal value in it until it has the same length with a. At the same time, we can extend the shorter one by adding any value in it which mainly depends on the DMs' risk preferences. Optimists anticipate desirable outcomes and may add the maximum value, while pessimists expect unfavorable outcomes and may add the minimal value.</p><p>Although Xu and Xia's extension rule is very reasonable, it does not consider the situation when the DM is assumed to be risk-neutral. We now develop a new method, which can reveal the DM's risk preference (including risk-averse, risk-neutral, and risk-seeking) with a parameter g, to extend the shorter HFE until both of them have the same length when we compare them with l a -l b .</p><p>Definition 2. Assume a HFE h = {h r(i) ji = 1, 2, . . . , l h }, and stipulate that h + and h À are the maximum and minimum values in the HFE h, respectively; then we call h ¼ gh þ þ ð1 À gÞh À an extension value, where g(0 6 g 6 1) is the parameter determined by the DM according his/her risk preference. Therefore, we can add different values to the HFE using g according the DM's risk preference. If g = 1, then the extension value h ¼ h þ , which indicates that the DM's risk preference is riskseeking; while if g = 0, then h ¼ h À , which means that the DM's risk preference is risk-averse. It is clear that Xu and Xia's extension rule is consistent with our extension rule when g = 1 and g = 0. Moreover, when the DM's risk preference is risk-neutral, we can add the extension value</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h ¼ 1 2 ðh þ þ h À Þ, i.e., g ¼ 1 2 .</formula><p>Apparently, the parameter g provided by the DM reflects his/her risk preference which can affect the final decision results. Meanwhile, Torra <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> indicated that the envelope of a HFE is an intuitionistic fuzzy value (IFV), which is shown as follows:</p><p>Definition 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Given a HFE h, we define the IFV A env (h) as the envelope of h, where A env (h) can be represented as (h À ,1 À h + ), with h À = min{cjc 2 h} and h + = max{cjc 2 h}.</p><p>Based on the above operational laws and the principle of extension, Xu and Xia <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> defined the hesitant Euclidean distance for HFEs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d 1 ða; bÞ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 l X l i¼1 ja rðiÞ À b rðiÞ j 2 v u u t<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>However, sometimes it is somewhat difficult for the DMs to assign exact values for the membership degrees of certain elements to a given set, but a range of values belonging to [0,1] may be assigned. To cope with such a situation, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> firstly put forward the concept of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set (IVHFS), which permits the memberships of an element to a given set having a few different interval values: where c ¼ ½c L ; cU is an interval number. cL ¼ inf c and cU ¼ sup c express the lower and upper limits of c, respectively. Obviously, if cL ¼ cU , then the IVHFEs reduce to the HFEs.</p><p>Definition 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Let h; h1 and h2 be three IVHFEs, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(1) hc ¼ f½1 À cU ; 1 À cL jc 2 hg; (2) h1 [ h2 ¼ max cL 1 ; cL 2 À Á ; max cU 1 ; cU 2 À Á Â Ã jc 1 2 h1 ; c2 2 h2 n o ; (3) h1 \ h2 ¼ min cL 1 ; cL 2 À Á ; min cU 1 ; cU 2 À Á Â Ã jc 1 2 h1 ; c2 2 h2 n o ; (4) hk ¼ f½ðc L Þ k ; ðc U Þ k jc 2 hg; k &gt; 0; (5) k h ¼ f½1 À ð1 À cL Þ k ; 1 À ð1 À cU Þ k jc 2 hg; k &gt; 0; (6) h1 È h2 ¼ cL 1 þ cL 2 À cL 1 Á cL 2 ; cU 1 þ cU 2 À cU 1 Á cU 2 Â Ã jc 1 2 h1 ; c2 2 h2 n o ; (7) h1 h2 ¼ cL 1 Á cL 2 ; cU 1 Á cU 2 Â Ã jc 1 2 h1 ; c2 2 h2 n o .</formula><p>Motivated by the distance measures for HFSs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, in what follows, we propose some basic distance measures between IVH-FEs, such as the interval-valued hesitant Hamming-Hausdorff distance, the interval-valued hesitant Euclidean-Hausdorff distance, the hybrid interval-valued hesitant Hamming distance, and the hybrid interval-valued hesitant Euclidean distance: Definition 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. For two IVHFEs h1 and h2 , the distance measure between h1 and h2 , denoted as dð h1 ; h2 Þ, should satisfy the following properties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(1) 0 6 dð h1 ; h2 Þ 6 1; (2) dð h1 ; h2 Þ ¼ 0 if and only if h1 ¼ h2 ; (3) dð h1 ; h2 Þ ¼ dð h2 ; h1 Þ.</formula><p>In most cases, the number of intervals for different IVHFEs could be different, and the interval values are usually out of order. For convenience, let l ¼ maxflã; lbg, where lã and lb are the numbers of intervals in IVHFEs ã and b, respectively, and we arrange the interval values in any order based on a possibility degree formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In order to more accurately calculate the distance between two IVHFEs, it is necessary that two IVHFEs have the same number of intervals. Similar to Definition 2, we can define a new extension rule for IVHFEs as follows: Definition 7. Assume an IVHFE h ¼ f hrðiÞ ji ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; lhg, and stipulate that hþ and hÀ are the maximum and the minimum interval values in the IVHFE h, respectively; then we call h ¼ g hþ þ ð1 À gÞ hÀ an extension interval value, where g(0 6 g 6 1) is the parameter determined by the DM according his/her risk preference.</p><p>Therefore, if lãlb, then we should add the different interval values to the IVHFE using the parameter g according the DM's risk preference. In other word, when the DM's risk preference is riskneutral, we can add the extension interval value</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h ¼ 1 2 ð hþ þ hÀ Þ,</formula><p>i.e., g ¼ 1 2 ; when the DM's risk preference is risk-seeking, we can add the extension interval value h ¼ hþ , i.e., g = 1; when the DM's risk preference is risk-averse, we can add the extension interval value h ¼ hÀ , i.e., g = 0.</p><p>For instance, let ã ¼ f½0:1; 0:2; ½0:2; 0:3; ½0:1; 0:3g, b ¼ f½0:3; 0:4; ½0:4; 0:5g, and lã &gt; lb. According to the rules mentioned above, we should extend b until it has the same length with ã, the risk-seeking DM may extend b as b ¼ f½0:3; 0:4; ½0:4; 0:5; ½0:4; 0:5g, the risk-averse DM may extend it as b ¼ f½0:3; 0:4; ½0:3; 0:4; ½0:4; 0:5g, and the riskneutral DM may extend it as b ¼ f½0:3; 0:4; ½0:35; 0:45; ½0:4; 0:5g.</p><p>Apparently, the parameter g provided by the DM reflects his/her risk preference which can affect the final decision results. In this paper, we assume that the decision makers are all risk-averse.</p><p>Based on the well-known Hamming distance and the Euclidean distance as well as the above operational principles, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> gave the distance measures for IVHFEs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d 2 ðã; bÞ ¼ 1 2l X l i¼1 ãL rðiÞ À bL rðiÞ þ ãU rðiÞ À bU rðiÞ<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">d 3 ðã; bÞ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 2l X l i¼1 ãL rðiÞ À bL rðiÞ 2 þ ãU rðiÞ À bU rðiÞ 2 s<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where ã and b are two IVHFEs; ãL rðiÞ ; ãU rðiÞ ; bL rðiÞ and bU rðiÞ are the ith largest values in ãL ; ãU ; bL and bL , respectively, which will be used thereafter.</p><p>Analogous to the distance measures for HFEs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, we further propose some other basic distance measures between IVHFEs:</p><p>The interval-valued hesitant Hamming-Hausdorff distance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">d 4 ðã; bÞ ¼ 1 2 max i ãL rðiÞ À bL rðiÞ þ ãU rðiÞ À bU rðiÞ n o<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>The interval-valued hesitant Euclidean-Hausdorff distance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">d 5 ð ã; bÞ ¼ 1 2 max i ãL rðiÞ À bL rðiÞ 2 þ ãU rðiÞ À bU rðiÞ 2 &amp; '<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>The hybrid interval-valued hesitant Hamming distance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">d 6 ðã; bÞ ¼ 1 2 1 2l X l i¼1 ãL rðiÞ À bL rðiÞ þ ãU rðiÞ À bU rðiÞ þ 1 2 max i ãL rðiÞ À bL rðiÞ þ ãU rðiÞ À bU rðiÞ n o<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>The hybrid interval-valued hesitant Euclidean distance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d 7 ðã; bÞ ¼ 1 2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 2l X l i¼1 ãL rðiÞ À bL rðiÞ 2 þ ãU rðiÞ À bU rðiÞ 2 s þ 1 2 max i ãL rðiÞ À bL rðiÞ 2 þ ãU rðiÞ À bU rðiÞ 2 &amp; '<label>ð10Þ</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Computing the optimal weights by the maximizing deviation method</head><p>The estimation of the attribute weights plays an important role in MADM. The maximizing deviation method was proposed by Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> to determine the attribute weights for solving MADM problems with numerical information. According to Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, for a MADM problem, the attribute with a larger deviation value among alternatives should be assigned a larger weight, while the attribute with a small deviation value among alternatives should be signed a smaller weight. In other word, if the performance values of all the alternatives have small differences under an attribute, it shows that such an attribute plays a less important role in the priority procedure. On the contrary, if an attribute makes the performance values of all the alternatives have obvious differences, then this attribute plays a much important role in choosing the best alternative. So from the standpoint of ranking the alternatives, if one attribute has similar attribute values across alternatives, it should be assigned a small weight; otherwise, the attribute which makes larger deviations should be evaluated a bigger weight, in spite of the degree of its own importance. Especially, if all available alternatives score equally with respect to a given attribute, then such an attribute will be judged unimportant by most of DMs. Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> suggested that zero weight should be assigned to the corresponding attribute.</p><p>Hence, we here construct an optimization model based on the maximizing deviation method to determine the optimal relative weights of attributes under hesitant fuzzy environment. For the attribute x j 2 X, the deviation of the alternative A i to all the other alternatives can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">D ij ðwÞ ¼ X m k¼1 dðh ij ; h kj Þw j ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m; j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">d 1 ðh ij ; h kj Þ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 1 l P l k¼1 h rðkÞ ij À h rðkÞ kj 2 r</formula><p>denotes the hesitant Euclidean distance between the HFEs h ij and h kj defined as in Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">An approach to MADM with hesitant fuzzy information</head><p>In general, after obtaining the attribute weight values on basis of the maximizing deviation method, analogous to the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, we should utilize a certain kind of operator to aggregate the given decision information so as to get the overall preference value of each alternative, and then rank the alternatives and select the most desirable one(s). In the process of hesitant fuzzy information aggregation, however, it produces the loss of too much information due to the complexity of the aggregation process of hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators, which implies a lack of precision in the final results. Therefore, in order to overcome this disadvantage, we have extended the TOPSIS method to take hesitant fuzzy information into account and utilized the distance measures of HFEs to obtain the final ranking of the alternatives. TOPSIS, proposed by Hwang and Yoon <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, is a kind of method to solve MADM problems, which aims at choosing the alternative with the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS), and is widely used for tackling the ranking problems in real situations.</p><p>Under hesitant fuzzy environment, the hesitant fuzzy PIS, denoted by A + , and the hesitant fuzzy NIS, denoted by A À , can be defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">A þ ¼ x j ; max i h rðkÞ ij D E jj ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n &amp; ' ¼ x 1 ; h 1 1 þ ; h 2 1 þ ; . . . ; h l 1 þ ( ) ; &amp; Â x 2 ; h 1 2 þ ; h 2 2 þ ; . . . ; h l 2 þ ( ) ; . . . ; Â x n ; h 1 n þ ; h 2 n þ ; . . . ; h l n þ ( ) '<label>ð23Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">A À ¼ fx j ; min i h rðkÞ ij D E jj ¼ 1; 2; ÁÁÁ;ng ¼ x 1 ; h 1 1 À ; h 2 1 À ; ...; h l 1 À D E ; x 2 ; h 1 2 À ; h 2 2 À ; ...; h l 2 À D E ; ...; n Â x n ; h 1 n À ; h 2 n À ; ...; h l n À D E o<label>ð24Þ</label></formula><p>The separation between alternatives can be measured by Hamming distance or Euclidean distance.

Obviously, an alternative A i is closer to the hesitant fuzzy PIS (A + ) and farther from the hesitant fuzzy NIS (A À ) as C i approaches 1. Therefore, according to the closeness coefficient C i , we can determine the ranking orders of all alternatives and select the best one from a set of feasible alternatives. Based on the above models, we shall develop a practical approach for solving MADM problems, in which the information about attribute weights is incompletely known or completely unknown, and the attribute values take the form of hesitant fuzzy information.

For a MADM problem, we construct the decision matrix H = [h ij ] mÂn , where all the arguments h ij (i = 1,2,. . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n) are HFEs, given by the DMs, for the alternative A i 2 A with respect to the attribute x j 2 X.</p><p>Step 2. If the information about the attribute weights is completely unknown, then we can obtain the attribute weights by using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">22</ref>); if the information about the attribute weights is partly known, then we solve the model (M-2) to obtain the attribute weights. Step 3. Utilize Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">23</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> to determine the corresponding hesitant fuzzy PIS A + and the hesitant fuzzy NIS A À . Step 4.

Utilize Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">27</ref>) to calculate the relative closeness coefficient C i of each alternative A i to the hesitant fuzzy PIS A + . Step 6. Rank the alternatives A i (i = 1,2,. . . , m) according to the relative closeness coefficients C i (i = 1,2,. . . , m) to the hesitant fuzzy PIS A + and then select the most desirable one(s).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">An energy police selection problem under hesitant fuzzy environment and the analysis process</head><p>Energy is an indispensable factor for the social and economic development of societies. The correct energy policy affects economic development and environment, the most appropriate energy policy selection is very important. Suppose that there are five alternatives (energy projects) A i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), and four attributes: P 1 : technological; P 2 : environmental; P 3 : socio-political; P 4 : economic. Several DMs are invited to evaluate the performances of the five alternatives. For an alternative under an attribute, although all of the DMs provide their evaluation values, some of these values may be repeated. However, a value repeated more times does not indicate that it has more importance than other values repeated less times. For example, the value repeated one time may be provided by a DM who is an expert at this area, and the value repeated twice may be provided by two DMs who are not familiar with this area. In such cases, the value repeated one time may be more important than the one repeated twice. To get a more reasonable result, it is better that the DMs give their evaluations anonymously. We only collect all of the possible values for an alternative under an attribute, and each value provided only means that it is a possible value, but its importance is unknown. Thus the times that the values repeated are unimportant, and it is reasonable to allow these values repeated many times appear only once. The HFE is just a tool to deal with such cases, and all possible evaluations for an alternative under the attributes can be considered as a HFE. The results evaluated by the DMs are contained in a hesitant fuzzy decision matrix, shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>. The hierarchical structure of this decision making problem is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>Obviously the numbers of values in different HFEs of HFSs are different. In order to more accurately calculate the distance between two HFSs, we should extend the shorter one until both of them have the same length when we compare them. According to the regulations mentioned above, we consider that the DMs are pessimistic in Example 1, and change the hesitant fuzzy data by adding the minimal values as listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>Then, we utilize the approach developed to get the most desirable alternative (s), which involves the following two cases: Case 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Comparison analysis with other similar methods</head><p>More recently, Nan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> proposed a fuzzy TOPSIS method for solving MADM problems with intuitionistic fuzzy information. Since the HFEs' envelopes are the intuitionistic fuzzy values, and at same time consider that under hesitant fuzzy environment, there has no investigation similar to our approach, in Subsection 5.2, we have made a comparison with the intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS (IF-TOPSIS) method of Nan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, which is the closest to our approach. Considering the HFSs' envelopes, i.e., intuitionistic fuzzy data, and according to Definition 3, we can transform the hesitant fuzzy data of the energy police selection problem into the intuitionistic fuzzy data, listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. Moreover, since the IF-TOPSIS method needs to know the weight values in advance, hence we also assume the weight vector as w = (0.2341, 0.2474, 0.3181, 0.2004) T .</p><p>With the IF-TOPSIS method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, we first need to determine the intuitionistic fuzzy PIS e A þ and the intuitionistic fuzzy NIS e A À , respectively: e A À ¼ fh0:1; 0:1i; h0:1; 0:1i; h0:1; 0:2i; h0:3; 0:1ig; e A þ ¼ fh0:6; 0:3i; h0:6; 0:1i; h0:7; 0:1i; h0:6; 0:1ig  Then, according to the distance measure of IFVs: Finally, according to the relative closeness coefficients e C i ði ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4; 5Þ, we rank the alternatives A i (i = 1, 2,3, 4, 5):</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">d 8 ðA i ; A k Þ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 1 2 X n j¼1 w j ððu ij À u kj Þ 2 þ ðv ij À v kj Þ 2 þ ðp ij À p kj Þ 2 Þ r<label>ð38Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_55">A 3 1 A 5 1 A 1 1 A 2 1 A 4 .

The differences are the ranking orders between A 3 and A 5 , and between A 1 and A 2 , i.e., A 3 1 A 5 and A 1 1 A 2 for the former while A 5 1 A 3 and A 2 1 A 1 for the latter. Namely, the ranking orders of these pairs of alternatives are just converse. The main reason is that the our approach considers the hesitant fuzzy information which is represented by several possible values, not by a margin of error (as in HFEs), while if adopting the Nan et al.'s method, it needs to transform HFEs into IFVs, which gives rise to a difference in the accuracy of data in the two types, it will have an effect on the final decision results. Thus it is not hard to see that our approach has some desirable advantages over the Nan et al.'s method <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> as follows:</p><p>(1) Our approach, by extending the TOPSIS method to take into account the hesitant fuzzy assessments which are well-suited to handle the ambiguity and impreciseness inherent in MADM problems, does not need to transform HFEs into IFVs but directly deals with these problems, and thus obtains better final decision results. In particular, when we meet some situations where the information is represented by several possible values, our approach shows its great superiority in handling those decision making problems with hesitant fuzzy information.</p><p>(2) Our approach utilizes the maximizing deviation method to objectively determine the weight values of attributes, which is more reasonable; while the Nan et al.'s method needs the DM to provide the weight values in advance, which is subjective and sometime cannot yield the persuasive results.</p><p>In addition, although there has no investigation similar to the proposed approach in this paper, there have few methods about the extension of information aggregation techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> for MADM under hesitant fuzzy scenarios.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>In general, many real-world MADM problems take place in a complex environment and usually adhere to imprecise data and uncertainty. The HFS or IVHFS is adequate for dealing with the vagueness of a DM's judgments over alternatives with respect to attributes. In this paper, based on the idea that the attribute with a larger deviation value among alternatives should be evaluated with a larger weight, we have first developed a method called the maximizing deviation method to determine the optimal relative weights of attributes under hesitant fuzzy or interval-valued hesitant fuzzy environment. An important advantage of the proposed method is its ability to relieve the influence of subjectivity of the DMs and at the same time remain the original decision information sufficiently. Then we have proposed a novel approach on the basis of TOPSIS to solve MADM problems with hesitant fuzzy or interval-valued hesitant fuzzy information. The approach is based on the relative closeness of each alternative to determine the ranking order of all alternatives, which avoids producing the loss of too much information in the process of information aggregation. Finally, the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method has been illustrated with an energy police selection example. Apparently, our approach is straightforward and has less loss of information, and can be applied easily to other managerial decision making problems under hesitant fuzzy or interval-valued hesitant fuzzy environment.</p></div>
