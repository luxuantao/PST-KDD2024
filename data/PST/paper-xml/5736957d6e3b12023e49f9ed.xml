To make the controller design feasible, the unknown control coefficients are grouped together and the original system is transformed into a new system using a linear state transformation technique.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R ECENTLY, stochastic nonlinear control has received more and more attention due to the existence of stochastic disturbances in many practical systems. With the proposition of many important concepts of stochastic stability theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, quite a number of research results on deterministic nonlinear systems have been extended to stochastic nonlinear systems, for example, Sontags stabilization formula, nonlinear optimality, and backstepping technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, where the backstepping approach was developed to the point of a step-by-step design procedure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The main technical obstacle in the Lyapunov design for stochastic systems is that the I t ô stochastic differentiation involves not only the gradient but also the higher order Hessian term. Pan and Basar <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> were the first to solve the stochastic stabilization problem for a class of strict-feedback systems based on a risk-sensitive cost criterion. By employing the quadratic Lyapunov functions, Deng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> extended the backstepping design method to output-feedback stabilization and state-feedback stabilization of stochastic nonlinear systems, respectively. However, the combined problem of the control of stochastic nonlinear systems with nonlinear uncertainties simultaneously is still a cumbersome issue.</p><p>As well known, both neural network (NN) and fuzzy logic system (FLS) have been proved to be a useful tool for solving the control problem of uncertain systems with unknown nonlinear functions in practical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. By combining NNs or FLSs with the backstepping design technique, several adaptive NN or adaptive fuzzy backstepping control schemes have been developed for several classes of stochastic nonlinear systems with mismatched conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For example, a novel adaptive fuzzy backstepping control scheme was proposed based on the observer design in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for a class of stochastic nonlinear strict-feedback systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, two constructive output-feedback control approaches were developed based on adaptive NNs for two classes of stochastic nonlinear systems, respectively. In addition, by combining backstepping technique with stochastic small-gain approach, a novel robust adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller was presented for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> extended the above results to a class of stochastic nonlinear large-scale systems, respectively. More recently, a novel adaptive control scheme was proposed for a class of uncertain nonlinear stochastic systems based on fuzzy NN approximation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>However, when approximating the unknown smooth functions using either NNs or FLSs, the number of parameters to be tuned online, i.e., the neural weights of hidden units in a NN, or the fuzzy weights in a FLS, will grow rapidly with the dimension of the argument vector of the function to be approximated <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which causes the explosion of learning parameters. Consequently, it makes the complex NNs or FLSs unsuitable for the real-time systems that are sensitive to time delays, and the time-consuming process is unavoidable during the implementation of these control algorithms. This problem was pointed out by Fischle and Schroder <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and first solved by Yang and Ren <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> in their pioneering work, where the so-called minimal learning parameter (MLP) algorithm containing much less online adaptive parameters were constructed by fusion of traditional backstepping technique and radialbasis-function (RBF) NNs. Recently, by combining dynamic surface control and MLP techniques, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> first proposed an algorithm that can simultaneously solve both problems of the explosion of learning parameters and the explosion of computation complexity. Then, a novel adaptive neural output feedback controller based on reduced-order observer was explored for a class of uncertain nonlinear Single Input Single Output systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. More recently, by estimating the maximum of NN parameters, Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> designed an adaptive neural controller containing only one adaptive parameter. Nevertheless, little work has been done to investigate the adaptive NN or fuzzy output-feedback control problem for stochastic nonlinear systems with unknown control directions.</p><p>It is well known that the control directions, defined as signs of the control gains, are normally required to be known a priori in adaptive control literature. However, the unknown control directions often exist in many practical nonlinear systems. It is also a major source of resulting in instability of the control systems. When the signs of control gains are unknown, the adaptive control problem becomes much more difficult, since we cannot decide the direction along which the control operates. This problem has been remained open till the Nussbaum-type gain was first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for adaptive control of a class of first-order linear systems. Later on, the Nussbaum gain was extended to adaptive control of nonlinear systems with unknown control directions incorporated with different techniques. For example, Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> investigated the output-feedback adaptive stabilization for a class of nonlinear systems with unknown control directions using the linear state transformation technique. Wen and Ren <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed a state observer-based adaptive neural control scheme for the systems with unknown control directions and unmeasurable states. To handle the unknown control directions in stochastic nonlinear systems, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> proposed adaptive fuzzy or neural backstepping control methods for stochastic nonlinear systems using the Nussbaum function technique under state feedback framework, respectively. Recently, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> developed an adaptive fuzzy outputfeedback control scheme for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems with unknown control direction, in which only one control coefficient was assumed unknown. However, little work was dedicated to the unknown control direction problem for stochastic nonlinear systems along with time delays.</p><p>In many practical control systems, such as biological system, microwave oscillators, nuclear reactors, network system and so on, there often exists time delay, which is frequently a source of instability, and the control performance of these systems is often degraded. Over the past years, the problem of adaptive control design along with the stability analysis for the time-delay systems has been a popular topic and significant progress has been achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. For example, Ge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and Hong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> successfully constructed state feedback controllers for nonlinear time-delay systems, respectively. Hua et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and Tong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> investigated the output-feedback control problems for nonlinear time-delay systems, respectively. Then, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> developed an adaptive consensus control scheme for a class of nonlinear multiagent time-delay systems with the help of NNs approximation. Recently, Chen and Jiao <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> addressed the problem of adaptive NN output-feedback control for a class of uncertain stochastic nonlinear strict-feedback systems with time-varying delays, where the problem of nonlinear observer design was solved by introducing the circle criterion. More recently, without controllable linearization and by first employing the adding-a-power-integer technique to solve the stabilization problem of stochastic time-delay systems, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> investigated the state-feedback stabilization problem for a class of lower-triangular stochastic time-delay nonlinear systems. However, to the best of the authors knowledge, there is no result reported on the output-feedback control problem of stochastic nonlinear systems with both time-varying delays and unknown control directions.</p><p>Motivated by the above observations, incorporating the linear state transformation with MLP techniques, an adaptive backstepping output-feedback neural control scheme is proposed for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems with both time-varying delays and unknown control directions. The unknown control coefficients are grouped together and the original system is transformed into a new system by employing the linear state transformation technique. Then, the Nussbaum-type gain function is used to deal with the unknown parameters caused by the unknown control directions in the new system. In addition, an RBF NN is used to approximate all unknown nonlinear terms depending on the delayed output. Still, the MLP technique is used to alleviate the computational burden by estimating the maximum of NN parameters. Compared with the existing results, the main contributions in this paper lie in the following: 1) for the first time, the linear state transformation technique is introduced to the stochastic nonlinear time-varying delay systems with unknown control directions. Moreover, unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the assumption on the value of the unknown control coefficients is not needed, both control singularity and unknown control direction can be tackled in this paper; 2) all the unknown output-dependent functions are grouped into a suitable unknown function that is compensated only by one NN. This simplifies the design procedure and reduces the computation loads dramatically; and 3) by estimating the maximum of NN parameters instead of the parameters themselves, the parameters to be estimated are greatly decreased. Hence, the explosion of learning parameters is solved efficiently.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides some notations and preliminary knowledge. The problem formulation is presented in Section III. In Section IV, the adaptive output-feedback control design and stability analysis are presented for the stochastic nonlinear time-varying delay systems with unknown directions. Section V gives some simulation examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper, followed by the conclusion presented in Section VI.</p></div>

Only the system output y can be available for measurement.</p><p>Remark 3.1: It is known that nonlinear systems with unknown directions exist in a wide range of physical and engineering practices, such as in ship control problem and air space control problem. When all the control directions of the nonlinear systems are unknown, the control design for such systems will become more challenging. It has been shown that the Nussbaum function technique is an effective tool to deal with the unknown control coefficients, and various results have been obtained, but most of them are for state feedback, or output feedback with only one unknown control coefficient. Therefore, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">9</ref>) is more general.</p><p>Remark 3.2: In this paper, we only consider that the smooth functions φ i (•) are the function of the output y, but not the function of the system state vector xi . φ i (0) = 0 implies that the origin is the equilibrium point of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. g i are positive or negative but not zero, which satisfies the controllability condition of (9).</p><p>Remark 3.3: The time-varying delays of (9) only exist in the system output. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, the timevarying delay problem will be solved by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. However, they did not consider the cases with all unknown control directions along with time-varying delays in the stochastic nonlinear systems.</p><p>Since the values and signs of the unknown control coefficients are unknown, the output-feedback control design becomes very hard. To make the output-feedback control design feasible, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">9</ref>) is transformed into a new system using the linear state transformation technique. Therefore, the original unknown control coefficients are grouped together in the new states.</p><p>Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">ζ i = x i / n j =i g j , for i = 1, . . . , n, then, the new state variables ζ = [ζ 1 , . . . , ζ n ] are given by ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ dζ i = ζ i+1 + 1 n j =i g j (φ i (y) + f i (y, y(t -d(t)))) dt + 1 n j =i g j h i (y, y(t -d(t)))dw . . . dζ n = u + 1 g n (φ n (y) + f n (y, y(t -d(t)))) dt + 1 g n h n (y, y(t -d(t)))dw.

If all the states of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">10</ref>) are available, it is easy to design a controller. But, because of the existence of unknown control coefficients in the linear state transformation, all the states of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">10</ref>) are unavailable. Therefore, a full-order state observer must be established first to estimate the unmeasured states.</p><p>Then, a novel NN adaptive output-feedback control scheme will be explored based on the designed observers. Remark 3.4: After the linear state transformation, (9) becomes a strict-feedback uncertain nonlinear system with both unknown parameters 1/ n j =i g j and unknown timevarying delays. Therefore, it is much feasible to design a better controller.</p><p>Consider the observers for <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ ζ i = ζi+1 -k i ζ1</formula><p>. . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">ζ n = u -k n ζ1<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where k 1 , . . . , k n are optional positive constants such that the following matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">A = ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ -k 1 I n-1 . . . -k n 0 • • • 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦</formula><p>is asymptotically stable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, the output-feedback adaptive neural control has been investigated for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems with time-varying delays and unknown control directions. Through a linear state transformation, the unknown control coefficients are grouped together and the original system is transformed into a new system that makes the control design become feasible. The proposed adaptive neural controller contains only one adaptive parameter that is relevant to the given NNs such that the online learning time is dramatically decreased. Notably, only one NN is employed to compensate for all the unknown functions. The stability analysis guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability. The simulation examples demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Future works will focus on the virtual control gain function and the function φ( xi ) rather than φ(y), which will make the design more challenging.   </p><formula xml:id="formula_98">+ t 0 e -c(t -s) ∂ V ∂z 1 h 1 - n i=2 ∂ V ∂z i ∂α i-1 ∂y h 1 + ∂ V ∂ ζ H dw(s).
