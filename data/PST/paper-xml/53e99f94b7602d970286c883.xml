<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has led to the design of numerous imaging techniques. One of these is Diffusion Tensor MRI (DT-MRI), which measures the motion of hydrogen atoms within water in all three dimensions. In tissue containing a large number of fibers, like skeletal muscle or white brain matter, water tends to diffuse only along the direction of the fibers. The DT-MRI technique has raised hopes in the neuro-science community for a better understanding of the fiber tract anatomy of the human brain. Various methods have been proposed to use DT-MRI data to track nerve fibers and derive connectivity between different parts of the brain in vivo <ref type="bibr">[1, 2, 11-13, 15, 16]</ref>.</p><p>A simple and effective method for tracking nerve fibers using DT-MRI is to follow the direction of the maximum diffusion in each voxel, equivalent to the direction of the main eigenvector in each tensor. This method is usually referred to as tracking using the Principal Diffusion Direction (PDD). Although this method is widely spread and used in various ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, it suffers from some major disadvantages. The connectivity is restricted to a one-to-one mapping between points, not allowing the branching that real fiber tracts may undergo. The PDD tracking also gives the impression of being precise, not taking uncertainty of fiber paths into account in the tracking procedure. Further, the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is very unstable when in proximity to the generic cases of planar and spherical diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>While there are strong indications that DT-MRI reveals information of the fiber pathways in the brain, it is important to stress the fact that the explicit quantity measured is water diffusion and not fibers. As DT-MRI is a fairly new field of research, many studies are yet to be made to compare the measured diffusion tensors to detailed tissue properties important for fiber path inference. However, in contrast to approaches such as solving the diffusion equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, it might be important to separate the physical phenomenon of water diffusion from the solution of the tracking problem through the use of a fiber model. In this way a priori knowledge about nerve fibers such as fiber stiffness could be taken into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we propose a fiber propagation method that is based on stochastics and regularization, allowing paths originating in one point to branch and return a probability distribution of possible paths. The proposed method utilizes the principles of Sequential Importance Sampling and Resampling (SISR) that belongs to the class of Monte Carlo methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Fiber models</head><p>Inspired by the nomenclature used by Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, single fiber paths will be represented by a sequence ¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ ¨ § © ¥ © © ¥ ¨ , where ¥ ¨ usually refers to positions in space.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Properly weighted sample</head><p>In order to work with a distribution £ ¦ ! , it should be represented in some convenient way. One choice of representation is by a set of properly weighted samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. A set of weighted random samples I '£ ¦ QP S R UT 2© V WP S R UT X `Y (a R Ub is called proper with respect to the distribution £ # 8 if for any square integrable function c d£ 4e S , f 3g c d£ BV P S R UT P S R UT 7h @¡ pi f rq ¨g c d£ ¦ 8 sh t© du Bv xw @y H¡ x© 2© ©</p><p>where i is a normalizing constant common to all the samples [10].

Drawing for example QP R UT directly from £ ¦ 8 with V WP S R UT ¡ gives a proper set of samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The ability to estimate expectations is an important quality for the approximation of a distribution. In fact, every probability distribution, no matter how complicated it is, can be represented to an acceptable degree of accuracy by a set of properly weighted samples from it <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, it might be difficult to perform the actual sampling. One frequently used method to draw random samples from complicated distributions is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>By the use of weighted samples the representation can be made more efficient. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> gives an intuitive understanding of the difference between weighted and unweighted sets of samples. In general, a set of weighted samples can represent a distribution with higher accuracy than a set of equally many non-weighted samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Importance sampling</head><p>An often effective way to draw a properly weighted sample I £ # %P S R UT © UV WP S R UT Y from a dis- tribution £ ¦ ! , is to use so called importance sampling.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Sequential build-up</head><p>In Sequential Importance Sampling a set of properly weighted samples of £ # 8 is built up sequentially, through a series of sample sets of increasing dimension, § £ ¦ § © U £ ¦ © © £ # © smoothly approaching the final distribution so that £ # ¡ 3¡ £ ¦ !

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Resampling and reallocating</head><p>Sometimes a representation of a distribution becomes inefficient by having many small weights compared to other dominating large weights. In those cases a more efficient representation can be obtained by pruning away samples with small weights and duplicating samples with large weights by doing a resampling of the distribution. One way of doing this is to generate a new set of properly weighted samples by resampling with replacement from the set, using the weight as a probability for a sample being resampled <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Related methods</head><p>Sequential Importance Sampling and Resampling is a method that belongs to the class of population Monte Carlo algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Similar methods are found in for instance control theory and are then often called particle filters. The name has been chosen because samples can be seen as particles in a state space, and the sampling from ¤ 0 £ B¥ 0 $ 0 76 can be seen as making the particles walk stochastically along a path in state space. Population Monte Carlo algorithms have also proved to be useful tools in a number of other scientific fields such as statistical physics, quantum mechanics and polymer science <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Connections to SISR</head><p>The rough model presented above can be interpreted in the SISR framework, giving it meaning and further guide the search for a good fiber path model. The propagation step of the rough model is viewed as the sequential build-up presented in 3.3.</p><p>9 The propagation step of the rough model can be interpreted as sampling from a trial distribution ¤ 0 `£ ¦¥ @0 $ 0 76 Q¡ £ ¦¥ @0 $ 0 76 and assuming that 10 £ # 30 76 ¡ 0 76 £ # 30 76 .

Still the conditional path propagation is considered to be fully described by the rough model propagation step as described above, but some compensation is done to for instance to punish some paths. One example is setting the weight to zero or close to zero for a fiber path entering or touching a forbidden area of the brain such as the ventricles. 9 To make full use of the SISR framework the propagation step of the rough model should only be considered as the conditional trial distribution close to the real fiber path distribution. This is true importance sampling of the paths and the weight should be adjusted according to equation 4, compensating for the slightly incorrect conditional trial distribution ¤ 0 £ B¥ @0 $ 30 76 . This is the most general approach, giving a large freedom to choose a realistic fiber model by selecting the weight appropriately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>The methods mentioned can be simulated using a sequential build-up or sequential sampling algorithm. To ensure a satisfying representation, as many as 100 000 samples (particles) were used.</p><p>A white matter mask was used to determine when the particles had reached the border between the white and the gray matter, i.e. when to stop the tracking. The mask was created using the EM-MFA segmentation method presented by Kapur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> below, the paths of only 200 particles are shown. Notice that the visualized paths should be interpreted as a representation of the probability distribution for 'true' paths, and not as individual 'true' paths themselves. , achieving an increased stochastic spread. Bottom right: Tracking using a higher value of , resulting in more regularized fiber paths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>The method of Sequential Importance Sampling and Resampling has the ability of simulating rich fiber path models. It can take advantage of the full tensor data as opposed to methods based solely on the principal diffusion direction. Though our proposed model depends heavily on the tensor as such, the SISR method is not dependent of the tensor representation. The SISR framework should be easy to adapt to more accurate diffusion measures in the future, a property it is expected to share with other Monte Carlo methods as well. A rich set of fiber models can be used and the theoretical framework provide means for approximately solving a well defined problem up to a chosen level of accuracy.</p><p>Despite using a simple model, it has been demonstrated how uncertainty can be taken into account during the tracking procedure. Using a Monte Carlo approach, the tracking paradigm has been extended from a one-to-one mapping to a one-to-many mapping, connecting one starting point to multiple end points in the brain. This could give a different and possibly better view of connectivity in the brain, taking branching of nerve fibers into account.</p></div>
