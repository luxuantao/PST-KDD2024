<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Opportunistic resources are often present in various resource sharing networks for the users to exploit, but their qualities often change over time. Fortunately, many user tasks are delay-tolerant, which offers the network users a favorable degree of freedom in waiting for and accessing the opportunistic resource at the time of its best quality. For such delay-tolerant and opportunistic resource sharing networks (DT-ORS-Net), the corresponding optimal accessing strategies developed in existing literature mainly focus on the single-user scenarios, while the potential competition from other peer users in practical multiuser DT-ORS-Net is often ignored. Considering this, a multiplayer Markov stopping game (M-MSG) is developed in this work, and the derived Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy of this M-MSG can guide network users to properly handle the potential competition from other peers and thus exploit the time diversity of the opportunistic resource more effectively, which in turn further improves the resource utilization efficiency. Applications in the cloud-computing and the mobile crowdsourcing networks are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and simulation results show that using the NE strategy of the proposed M-MSG can provide substantial performance gain as compared to using the conventional single-user optimal one.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In many of the existing and emerging resource sharing networks, opportunistic resources are often present in addition to the conventional regular resources, and can be exploited by the network users for further performance enhancement. For instance, besides the opportunistic spectrum resource exploited in cognitive radio networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, idle virtual machines may be offered by a cloud provider as an opportunistic computing resource in cloud-computing networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>; lowprice harvested energy (e.g., wind or solar energy) may be provided by a power station as an opportunistic resource in power networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; and mobile users with different taskaccomplishment capabilities provide another instantiation of opportunistic resources in mobile crowdsourcing networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Two notable characteristics of such opportunistic resources are that their qualities may change over time and are often difficult to be predicted accurately, and that a past opportunity usually cannot be recalled and hence users have to make their access decisions online. On the other hand, it is noticed that many practical user tasks are delay-tolerant. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> In the presence of resource quality dynamics, such deferrable feature of user tasks provides the users a favorable degree of freedom in waiting for and accessing the opportunistic resource at the time of its best quality. For example, as many computing tasks of a cloud user are not real-time requests, the user can wait and then access the opportunistic cloud computing resource when its price is low; similarly, in mobile crowdsourcing networks, a recruiter can wait to offload its task on the mobile user with the highest task-accomplishment capability.</p><p>To achieve the best performance in such delay-tolerant and opportunistic resource sharing networks (DT-ORS-Net), using a proper resource access strategy is crucial to the network users. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> In literature, some pioneering works have already been done in this direction, in the contexts of different applications. For example, an optimal cloud accessing rule is derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> that can guide a company in choosing a suitable time to migrate its computation assignments to a cloud, whose service quality, however, may fluctuate due to random security events. When the opportunistic resource of interest is the sequentially arrived secondary-users that can serve as relays for primary-users in cognitive radio networks, an optimal relay selection strategy is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the dynamism of electricity price and the deferrability of some home applications are exploited to design an optimal electricity utilization rule that can balance the electricity expense and waiting time. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, as a more economic-friendly alternative to the conventional direct cellular communications, vehicleassisted data delivery is proposed for the smart grid, where the smart meter users need to decide whether to hire a certain passing vehicle to deliver its electricity-related measurements to a control center based on the vehicle's task-accomplishment capability (e.g., delivering delay).</p><p>Nonetheless, these prior works mainly focus on the single-user cases and build their results on the classic optimal stopping theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> that can provide the optimal online strategy for accessing the sequentially arrived rewards when there is only one decision-maker. In fact, it has already been noticed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that a substantial amount of collisions will occur when all users follow the single-user optimal strategy, though no effective remedy is provided. To bypass this multiuser difficulty, a random contention access model is adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to simplify the multi-user problem into a single-user one, where a fixed and pre-assigned contention probability is assumed for each user. However, no effective regulation mechanism is provided to prevent selfish users from intentionally increasing their contention probabilities.</p><p>Considering the above, a new resource access strategy design framework that can both properly handle the potential competition from other peers and enforce more effective regulations to users' access behaviors is highly desirable to DT-ORS-Net applications. To this end, the two-player Markov stopping game (MSG) developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> can serve as a good starting point, which extends the classic optimal stopping theory into a game theoretic setting so as to handle the potential conflicts between the two players.</p><p>However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> does not provide a systematic method to deal with a general number of players and hence is still not readily applicable to practical DT-ORS-Net. With this consideration, in this work, a multi-player Markov stopping game (M-MSG) is developed as a generalization of the twoplayer case. Subsequently, a recursive construction of the Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy is derived for the M-MSG, through which the network users can suitably adapt their decisions to the potential conflicts from other users so as to effectively exploit the opportunistic resources. The NE property of the derived strategy also automatically ensures that users have no incentive to deviate. The applications of the proposed M-MSG framework to the cloud-computing networks and the mobile crowdsourcing networks will be demonstrated in this work as two concrete examples, though this framework is rather general and may assume broader applications in various DT-ORS-Net.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, two exemplary resource access problems in DT-ORS-Net are formulated and the background of the basic two-player MSG is briefly discussed. In Section III, the proposed M-MSG is developed and its applications to the resource access problems are demonstrated. Simulation results are presented in Section IV. Section V concludes this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND BACKGROUND ON TWO-PLAYER MARKOV STOPPING GAMES</head><p>In this section, two exemplary resource access problems in DT-ORS-Net are described, followed by a brief introduction to the basic two-player MSG.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Resource Access in Opportunistic Cloud-computing Networks</head><p>The first considered problem is resource access in opportunistic cloud-computing networks. In such networks, the cloud provider can offer two types of computing resources: the regular resource and the opportunistic resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Particularly, the opportunistic resources can be a set of virtual machines that are currently idle. To increase utilization efficiency, the opportunistic resources can be made available to the cloud users, at different prices depending on the front-end workload dynamics. To minimize their per-task payments to the cloud, cloud users need to strategically compete with each other for the limited opportunistic resource and strive to access it at the lowest possible price before the task deadline; cloud users that fail to access the opportunistic resources have to purchase the usually more expensive regular resources so as to ensure that their tasks can be completed in time. For this problem, the challenge comes from not only that users cannot accurately predict the future prices of the opportunistic resources but also that collisions may occur when other users intend to access the resource at the same time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Participant Recruitment in Mobile Crowdsourcing</head><p>Another problem of similar nature is participant recruitment in mobile crowdsourcing networks, in which multiple nearby recruiters contend for their potential task participants within the same shared pool of passing mobile users. For example, in a vehicle based crowdsourcing network <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, companies can set up access points near a highway and ask passing vehicles to advertise their products at a certain place using on-vehicle LED lights. Due to difference in the time of reaching and stay at the appointed locations, the task completion qualities of vehicles may be different from one to another; also each vehicle may only be able to perform one such task at a time.</p><p>Similarly to the previous resource access problem, to maximize their own rewards, recruiters must strategically select the most suitable mobile user as the task participant and properly deal with potential competition from other recruiters at the same time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Background on Two-player Markov Stopping Game</head><p>Before introducing the two-player MSG, some basics of the classic Markov stopping problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T * = inf{1 ≤ n ≤ N |f (X n ) = γ n },<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where γ n ess sup T ∈Tn [f (X T )|F n ] (with ess sup denoting the essential supremum) represents the optimal expected reward if the player stops no earlier than time n, given observations up to time n, and T n {T |È(T ≥ n) = 1}. Intuitively, (1) says that, when the current reward f (X n ) equals the best reward γ n that can be obtained in the future, the player should stop.</p><p>As in the two problems described in Section II-A and Section II-B and many other similar applications in DT-ORS-Net, it is usually the case that multiple players monitor the same sequence of opportunistic resource and contend with each other. To derive the optimal strategy for each player in such situations, the two-player MSG framework developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> may serve as a basis. Particularly, in the two-player MSG, two rational and selfish players monitor the same sequence {X n } and make their stopping decisions independently. When two players decide to access the reward (i.e., stop) at the same time n, only one of them (chosen uniformly at random by a third-party) can successfully receive the reward f (X n ) and then leave the game, reducing the two-player MSG to a classical Markov stopping problem (with time horizon N − n) for the remaining player. However, a systematic method for handling a general number of players in a MSG is missing from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Considering this, a general M-MSG is proposed in the next section so as to address the resource access problems in DT-ORS-Net.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. GENERAL MULTI-PLAYER MARKOV STOPPING GAME</head><p>In this section, a general M-MSG is developed along with a recursive construction of the corresponding NE strategy. Then, its applications to the resource access and the participant recruitment problems described in the previous section will be discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Extension to General Multi-player Markov Stopping Game</head><p>As in the two-player case, when multiple players decide to stop at the same time in the M-MSG, only one of them, chosen uniformly at random, can successfully receive the reward, while all other players continue to play the game. Consequently, the set of remaining players R n = {i 1 , ..., i |Rn| } (with i j ∈ {1, ..., K} and K the total number of players at the beginning) at different timeslot n (1 ≤ n ≤ N ) is random (and monotonically decreasing), which depends on the players' past actions (i.e., stop or continue) and in turn affects the future actions of remaining players.</p><p>The underlying principle of solving the M-MSG is to iteratively convert the multi-stage M-MSG into an equivalent auxiliary single-stage matrix game at each timeslot n; and then use the NE strategies of this sequence of N auxiliary single-stage matrix games to construct the NE strategy of the original multi-stage M-MSG. For this procedure, several new definitions are needed. Particularly, when two players coexist in the MSG, the randomized stopping time is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> to deal with the potential competition from the other player. To further handle the dynamism in the number of players as the game evolving, the concept of selection time is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. However, constructing the selection time essentially requires a full enumeration of all possible dynamics in the player numbers, and is not suitable for solving MSG with a general number of players. This can be evidenced from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, from which it can be seen that using the selection time to solve MSG with only three players is already almost prohibitive. Considering this, instead of resorting to the selection time, multi-player randomized stopping time, which explicitly takes the number of players into consideration as compared to the conventional randomized stopping time and thus can effectively address the dynamism in the number of players in M-MSG, is proposed in this work as follows.</p><p>Definition 1: In an M-MSG with K players and finite time horizon N , a strategy P k of player k is a sequence of random variables P k n N n=1 , such that, for each n, (1) 0 ≤ P k n ≤ 1 almost surely, and (2) P k n is measurable with respect to H n σ(F n , R n ). In the sequel, the set of all the possible strategies P k 's will be denoted by P.</p><p>Remark 1: Intuitively, P k n specifies the probability that player-k decides to take the stop action at the nth timeslot, which depends on the current observation history F n and the set of remaining players R n . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> Further due to Markovity of the stochastic process {X n , F n }, P k n is actually a function of X n and R n . But for simplicity, P k n will be used in the sequel, instead of P k n (X n , R n ), when there is no confusion. For a given strategy, the corresponding multi-player randomized stopping time is defined as follows.</p><p>Definition 2: Let {A k n } N n=1 be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with uniform distribution on [0, 1] and independent of the Markov process {X n , F n } N n=1 and {R n } N n=1 . The multiplayer randomized stopping time of player k based on the strategy P k is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T (P k ) inf{1 ≤ n ≤ N |A k n ≤ P k n }. (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>Remark 2: When K = 1 and P k n is either zero or one for all n, T (P k ) reduces to the classic stopping time. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> In other words, the classic single-player stopping time can be treated as a fixed stopping time, given the observation sequence. In the simulation results presented later in Section IV, the optimal single-player strategy will be denoted as P sgl .</p><p>With these notions, a recursive characterization of the NE strategy of the M-MSG is developed in the following. Particularly, at each timeslot n in the M-MSG, each remaining player chooses an action a i k from the action space A = {stop, continue}. For a given pair of X n and R n , denote Ũ i k Xn (a i1 , P i1 n+1 )..., (a </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[ P i k 1 , ..., P i k N ]</formula><p>) is an NE for an M-MSG with K players, if for all n, X n , R n , i k ∈ R n , and any arbitrary strategy P i k ∈ P, it admits</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">U i k Xn ( Pi1 , ..., Pi k , ..., Pi |Rn | )|X n , R n ≥ U i k Xn ( Pi1 , ..., P i k , ..., Pi |Rn | )|X n , R n ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where the expectation is over all the randomness in the future.</p><p>(That is, unilateral deviation from the NE cannot increase the expected reward.)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Remark 3: Note that Pi k n [0, ..., 0, P i k n , ..., P i k N</formula><p>] is an NE strategy for player i k from timeslot n and on, and Pi k 1 = Pi k in this notation.</p><p>Definition 4: The Nash value V i k n (X n , R n ) for player i k ∈ R n after observing X n at timeslot n is defined as its expected reward if all the players follow NE strategies. In particular,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">V i k n (X n , R n ) U i k Xn ( Pi1 , ..., Pi |Rn | )|X n , R n . (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>Remark 4: Note that when K = 1, the value at timeslot n is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> V 1 n (X n , 1) = ess sup</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P 1 ∈{P|n≤T (P)≤N } f X T (P 1 ) |X n .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Now it will be illustrated below how to recursively compute an NE strategy for each player. For ease of presentation, only symmetric games <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> will be considered in this work, in which the reward functions f of all players are identical; while nonsymmetric ones can be handled in a similar way but with more complicated notations. This assumption is reasonable when homogeneous cloud users and recruiters are considered. Under this symmetric game assumption, it is sufficient to consider</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R n |R n | instead of R n .</formula><p>Denote by S n = Rn k=1 ½ {a i k =s} the number of players that decide to stop at timeslot n. 7 It can be verified that 6 The expectation here is over the random selection of the third-party when multiple players decide to stop at the same time. 7 ½ {a i k =s} is the indicator function for the event that player-i k takes the stop action.</p><p>the expected <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">8</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Ũ i k Xn ((a i1 , Pi1 n+1 ), ..., (a iR n , PiR n n+1 ))|X n , R n = (7)                f (X n ), when a i k = s, S n = 1, f (X n )/S n + (1 − 1/S n ) V i k n (X n+1 , R n − 1)|X n , when a i k = s, S n ≥ 2, V i k n (X n+1 , R n )|X n , when a i k = c, S n = 0, V i k n (X n+1 , R n − 1)|X n , when a i k = c, S n ≥ 1, for 1 ≤ n &lt; N</formula><p>, and for n = N , it is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Ũ i k Xn ((a i1 , Pi1 n+1 ), ..., (a iR n , PiR n n+1 ))|X n , R n = f (X n )/S n , when a i k = s, 0, when a i k = c.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>End End</head><p>In the following, the developed M-MSG will be applied to solve the resource access and the participant recruitment problems described in Section II-A and Section II-B, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Proposed Solutions to Cloud-computing and Mobile Crowdsourcing Networks</head><p>To illustrate how to solve the resource access problem described in Section II-A using the proposed M-MSG framework, several notations and assumptions are clarified first, which hopefully don't change the nature of the problem while facilitate our discussion. Particularly, it is assumed that each cloud user generates a new computing task in every N cc timeslots that has to be completed before the next task arrives, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">9</ref>and the required execution time for each task is L timeslots. Also, when multiple users request the opportunistic resource at the same time, it is assumed that the provider can choose only one of them (uniformly) at random to grant access. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">10</ref>Moreover, considering that the front-end workload dynamism in a cloud can usually be modeled as a Markov process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, it is reasonable to assume that the sequence of opportunistic prices {Y n } N n=1 (with Y n ∈ {1, ..., M } for all n and M &lt; ∞ the highest possible price of the opportunistic resource) is also Markovian. The time horizon N of this problem is N = N cc − L and at the end of which, cloud users that fail to access the opportunistic resources have to purchase the regular resources at a usually higher price Y reg to meet the task-deadline. To convert the resource access problem into an M-MSG, the reward to a user when it successfully access the opportunistic resource at timeslot n is defined as X n Y reg − Y n , which represents its saving as compared to using regular resource and is Markovian as Y n . Then, to minimize its expected per-task payment, a cloud user can simply call Algorithm 1 (with f (X) = X) to compute its NE strategy P and access the cloud resource according to the corresponding multi-player randomized stopping time T ( P) given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, the participant recruitment problem described in Section II-B can also be resolved using the M-MSG framework. Denote the task deadline of recruiters by N mc , then the time horizon of the corresponding M-MSG is set to N = N mc . In the participant recruitment problem, if a recruiter fails to offload its task before the task-deadline, it receives zero reward. Denote the charge to a recruiter for a successfully offloaded task by c, and considering efficiency and limited budget of recruiters, it is assumed that a recruiter hires only one user for each task. The reward of a recruiter for successfully offloading a task to a mobile user arriving at the nth timeslot (after the task generation) is modeled as X n Q n − c, with Q n denoting the task accomplishment capability of that user. The task accomplishment capabilities Q n 's of different mobile users are assumed to follow uniform i.i.d. distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and so are X n 's. Similarly to the previous problem, a recruiter can invoke Algorithm 1 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> to determine optimally when to hire a mobile user.</p><p>Through the above two examples, it can be seen that the proposed M-MSG offers practical solutions for DT-ORS-Net applications. A network user only needs to identify a proper reward function f (X n ) based on its purpose and set a suitable time horizon N of the game based on its task completion time and deadline, and then runs Algorithm 1 to obtain its optimal resource access strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMULATIONS</head><p>In this section, simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the developed M-MSG when applied to the resource access and the participant recruitment problems, respectively. All the average values presented below are obtained from 1 × 10 6 Monte Carlo runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Resource Access in Opportunistic Cloud-computing Networks</head><p>For the resource access problem, it is assumed that the task generation period N cc = 6 (timeslots) and the task execution time L = 1 (timeslot). The price of regular resource is set to Y reg = 11 and the price of the opportunistic resource Y n is assumed to vary over the set {1, ..., 10}, with state transition probabilities   For this scenario, the corresponding NE strategy computed using Algorithm 1 is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In particular, Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref> shows the NE strategy Pn (X n , R n ) for different timeslot n and saving chances X n , when the number of remaining player is fixed to R n = 1. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">11</ref> It can be noticed that Pn (X n , R n ) = 0 in Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>, except for the last timeslot n = 5 and when X n reaches its maximum 10. This is because, when n = 5 or X n = 10, it is clear that the best strategy is to stop; while for other values of n and X n , it can be verified that for the specific È Y (Y n+1 |Y n ) considered here and R n = 1, the expected future saving [X n+1 ] is always larger than the current one X n ; consequently, the user always prefers waiting to stopping. In addition, it can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> that, in the presence of more remaining users, the NE strategy becomes more aggressive. For example, for the given timeslot n = 3 and saving chance X n = 1, the corresponding Pn (X n , R n ) increases from zero (in Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) to 0.3 (in Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) and further to 1 (in Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) when R n changes from 1 to 3 and to 5; similar observations can be made for other pairs of n and X n as well. The reason is that, in the presence of fewer users, each user focuses more on waiting for the best saving chance; while in the presence of more users, competing for the current saving chance becomes more important for each user, considering the risk of failing to obtain a reward due to the high probability of collision. Moreover, when R n reaches 7, the NE strategy of a user is to always stop and compete for the current saving chance (i.e., Pn (X n , R n ) = 1), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>; this is also the case when more than 7 users remain (c.f. Proposition 2).</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">ÈY (Yn+1|Yn) =      0.3, when Yn+1 = Yn − 1, 0.5, when Yn+1 = Yn, 0.2, when Yn+1 = Yn + 1, (13) for 2 ≤ n ≤ N −1, È Y (Y n+1 |Y n ) = 0.8 when Y n+1 = Y n =</formula><p>For the considered resource access problem in opportunistic cloud computing networks, the performance metric of interest is the average saving SA Y reg − Y T ′ of a user (e.g., user-1). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">12</ref> In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, for different total numbers of cloud users K, the corresponding average savings SA of user-1 when these K players employ different strategies are compared. Particularly, three special cases are investigated: (1) all users adopt the NE strategy P of the corresponding M-MSG, (2) only player-1 deviates from the NE and takes the singleplayer optimal strategy P sgl instead, and (3) all users follow the single-player optimal strategy P sgl ; the corresponding average savings of user-1 in these three cases are denoted by SA 1 , SA 2 and SA 3 , respectively. The corresponding relative performance gains G 1,3 (SA 1 − SA 3 )/SA 3 × 100/% and G 1,2 (SA 1 − SA 2 )/SA 2 × 100/% are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Several observations are in order. First notice from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> that the users can achieve more savings when following the NE strategy as compared to following the single-player optimal strategy P sgl ; for example, as shown shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, when there are K = 10 users, the NE strategy can provide about 180% extra saving as compared to the single-player optimal strategy. While if player-1 unilaterally deviates from the NE, its expected saving will decrease. In addition, the behavior change of SA 2 (blue curve) around K = 5 observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> provides some insights to the M-MSG and deserves further explanation. Particularly notice that, for a small K (i.e., less  than 5 in this example), SA 2 is still significantly higher than SA 3 and does not degrade much from SA 1 ; while for a larger K, SA 2 approaches SA 3 as K increases, indicating that it is crucial for player-1 to follow the NE strategy for large K.</p><p>Intuitively, this is because, when all the other users follow the NE strategy, they are likely to (successfully) stop at some timeslots that are different from the single-player optimal one, as evidenced by Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> where it can be seen that fewer pieces of resources are wasted when users take the NE strategy; and consequently fewer collisions are brought to player-1 even when player-1 follows P sgl . Nevertheless, as K further increases, the number of remaining users R n (which is on average larger for a larger K) becomes the dominant factor in causing collisions even when all users follow NE. In such situations, player-1 needs to stop more aggressively and accept some mildly good saving chance as specified by the NE strategy (c.f. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), instead of only stopping at the timeslot specified by P sgl .</p><p>Another observation from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> is that, as predicted by Proposition 2, SA 2 follows the hyperbola of SA × K = N n=1 X n for large K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Participant Recruitment in Mobile Crowdsourcing</head><p>As for the participant recruitment problem, it is assumed that each task has to be completed within N mc = 4 timeslots after generation and the payment c to the mobile user for a successfully offloaded task is set to 1. The task accomplishment capability Q of each mobile user is assumed to follow a uniform i.i.d. distribution over the set {2, ..., 6}.</p><p>The corresponding NE strategy for this example is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Similarly to the previous example, it can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> that recruiters need to take more aggressive strategy as the number of remaining recruiters R n increases, and when R n exceeds 11 the optimal strategy is to always strive to hire the current mobile user. The average rewards RW Q T ′′ − c of recruiter-1 (with T ′′ denoting the actual time when recruiter-1 successfully hires a mobile user) are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. As in the previous example, three cases of interest are considered and the corresponding average rewards of recruiter-1 are denoted by RW 1 , RW 2 and RW 3 , respectively. Again, it can be seen that the NE strategy can provide higher rewards to the recruiter than the single-player optimal strategy, and unilaterally deviating from the NE results in lower rewards. For example, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> when K = 8, the NE strategy can provide 30% improvement in reward as compared to the single-player optimal strategy. 13 In addition, RW 2 also exhibits behavioral changes as K increases, though the change is not as apparent as that of the cloud computing example with the Markov model, due to the stronger randomness of the i.i.d. model. It can also be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> that, again, for large K, RW 1 follows the hyperbola RW × K = N n=1 X n . Moreover, higher resource utilization efficiency can be observed in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> when recruiters follow the NE strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this work, an M-MSG is developed for the DT-ORS-Net. By following the derived NE strategy of the M-MSG, network users can properly handle the potential competition 13 The relative reward gains in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> are defined as  from other peers and thus effectively exploit the time diversity in the opportunistic resource, which in turn enhances the resource utilization efficiency. Another favorable feature of the derived resource access strategy is that it ensures that network users have no incentives to deviate due to its NE property. Two applications in the cloud-computing and the mobile crowdsourcing networks are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and corresponding simulation results show that using the NE strategy of the M-MSG can provide substantial performance gain as compared to using the single-user optimal strategy. Moreover, simulation results indicate that it becomes more important for network users to follow the derived NE strategy as the number of network users increases.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">G ′ 1,2 = (RW 1 − RW 2 )/RW 2 × 100% and G ′ 1,3 = (RW 1 − RW 3 )/RW 3 × 100%, respectively.</formula><p>As the developed M-MSG framework is rather general, exploring other potential applications in DT-ORS-Net remains an interesting future direction.</p></div>
