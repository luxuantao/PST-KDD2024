<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION</head><p>The management and control of communication among vehicles and between vehicles and an existing network infrastructure is currently one of the most challenging research fields in the networking domain. Using the terms vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), inter-vehicle communication (IVC), car to X (C2X), or vehicle to X (V2X), many applications -as interesting as they are challenging -have been envisioned and (at least) partially realized. In this context, a very active research field, vehicular networking, has emerged. There is a long list of desirable applications that can be grouped into four categories: • Safety applications that try to make driving safer (e.g., road hazard warning) • Traffic efficiency applications aimed at more efficient and thus greener traffic (e.g., detection of traffic jams) • Manufacturer-oriented applications (e.g., automatic software updates) • Comfort and entertainment applications (e.g., automatic map updates or video streaming)</p><p>While there are some similarities with fields like mobile ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks, the specific characteristics of vehicular networks require different communication paradigms, different approaches to security and privacy, and different wireless communication systems. For example, the nodes usually do not have severe power (at least while driving) and form factor constraints, and might be always on.</p><p>On the other hand, due to relatively high speeds, wireless communication may not be stable for a long time period, and network density is expected to vary from sparse to dense. Another challenging issue is the efficient use of available infrastructure, such as roadside units or even cellular networks.</p><p>We believe that many important research questions have only been partially answered, and the approaches discussed in the standardization bodies are based only on minimum consensus on the simplest solutions. Security and privacy, scalability, use of advanced communication patterns like aggregation, transmit power control, and optimal medium access are just a few such issues. In 2010, the first Dagstuhl Seminar was organized on the topic of inter-vehicular communication (IVC). The motivation was to bring together experts in this field to investigate the state of the art and highlight the existing solutions that adequately addressed some of the existing challenges. The main outcome of this inspiring seminar was to show that there are indeed areas within this research where scientific findings are being consolidated and adapted by industry. This was the consensus of very intriguing discussions among participants from both industry and academia. However, even more aspects were identified where substantial new research was still needed. These challenges have been summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>We are now entering an era that might change the game in road traffic management. This is supported by the U.S. federal government's announcement in February 2014 that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) plans to begin working on a regulatory proposal that would require V2V devices in new vehicles in the future. 1 This NHTSA announcement coincides with the final standardization of higher-layer networking protocols in Europe by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The Washington Post cartoon in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> nicely outlines this change and the related important challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABSTRACT</head><p>In September 2013, leading experts in intervehicle communication from all over the world met at the renowned Dagstuhl Castle for a seminar discussing the question "Inter-Vehicular Communication -Quo Vadis?" The objective was to identify the current state of the art and, more important, the open challenges in R&amp;D from both a scientific and an industrial point of view. After more than a decade of research on vehicular networks, the experts very seriously asked whether additional research in this field is necessary and, if so, which will be the most intriguing and innovative research directions. It turned out that the overall perspective has changed in the last few years, mainly as a result of the ongoing field operational tests in the United States and Europe. In this article, we report the key outcomes and results from the discussions, pointing to new research directions and new challenges that need to be met for a second generation of vehicular networking applications and protocols. In particular, we present the reports and findings from the four working groups on scientific foundations of vehicular networking, field operational tests, IVC applications, and heterogeneous vehicular networks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inter-Vehicle Communication: Quo Vadis</head><p>It was the goal of this new 2013 Dagstuhl Seminar to again bring together leading researchers both from academia and industry to discuss if and where the previously identified challenges have been adequately addressed, and to highlight where adequate solutions exist today, where better alternatives need to be found, and also to provide guidance on where to look for such alternatives. Furthermore, the goal of this workshop was to go one step beyond and identify where IVC can contribute to the basic foundations of computer science or where previously unconsidered foundations can contribute to IVC.</p><p>In particular, we shifted the focus from basic networking principles to applicability in realworld scenarios. In the last few years, the first field operational tests (FOTs) have been conducted in the United States (the Michigan field trial) as well as in Europe (simTD in Germany, DRIVE C2X in Europe). Our hypothesis was that lessons learned from those tests applied to currently used models and concepts would bring new insights into the forthcoming research challenges.</p><p>We organized the 2013 seminar again as a discussion forum. Three invited keynote presentations were organized to stimulate discussions among the participants. In order to steer the discussions, we organized four working groups that focused on selected open research challenges. In addition, we also solicited ad hoc presentations on topics of the working groups. The following working groups were formed and led to interesting observations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Scientific Foundations: In this group, one of the key questions discussed was which fundamental insights gained in the vehicular networking research domain can be transfered to other domains of computer science. The converse of this question has been discussed as well, that is, which areas of computer science might help foster work in vehicular networking and which may help overcome open challenges.</p><p>FOT: This group focused on the results that have already been derived from the ongoing work in various test sites in the United States and Europe. The main questions in the discussion were whether the current experiments are already sufficient to provide insights into largerscale behavior or additional tests are needed.</p><p>IVC Applications: In this group, the applications' perspective on IVC was discussed. In the last few years, many developments have been made looking at lower-layer networking problems. This has resulted in a number of networking solutions that nicely support specific applications but cannot be integrated to a generalized networking architecture.</p><p>Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks: As an important and timely topic, the working group focused on the integration of different networking technologies. This is strongly needed for developing integrated IVC solutions and also for coping with early deployment problems like the initial low penetration ratio.</p><p>Eventually, all these questions converge on the fundamental issue of whether vehicular networking can now be shown to improve efficiency and safety on our streets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATIONS</head><p>The working group on scientific foundations of IVC and computer science discussed the lasting value of achieved research results as well as potential future directions in the field of IVC. Two major themes "with variants" were the dependence on a specific technology (particularly the focus on IEEE 802.11p in the last decade) and the struggle to bring self-organizing networks to deployment/market.</p><p>The team started with a retrospective view and identified the following topics as major contributions in the last decade: analysis and design of single-hop broadcast communication and geonetworking <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, scalability issues (for both small and large penetration rates) as well as corresponding security and privacy approaches. In addition, all the work also led to a strong requirements elicitation for the domains of safety and efficiency applications, bringing together traffic experts, automotive engineers, and the IVC community. The Working Group considered various contributions to have lasting value, particularly analytical models for information dissemination, approaches to control or avoid congestion of the radio channel, building control applications on top of the unreliable wireless communication as well as a bunch of security approaches such as broadcast authentication and misbehavior detection. In addition, the Working Group tried to check whether results from the previous Dagstuhl Seminar on IVC in October 2010 led to new research directions and results. In the 2010 seminar, the participants proposed putting more focus on the applications and the assessment of their benefits, first ignoring too many technical details and then adding technological constraints successively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Several research results that appeared seem to have followed the proposed roadmap (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>).</p><p>The Working Group then did a "gap analysis," touching on the following two issues:</p><p>• To what extent should IVC research "tailor" a specific technology? • Should the interaction with other research communities be strengthened? It was identified that fault tolerance, reliable consensus, and cognition as computer science fields that should be more involved in IVC research. In addition, the engineering and deployment issues appear to deserve more attention; thus, an easy answer on how much "tailoring" and how much "general results" are needed could not be given. As a result of the discussions, the following research topics were found very promising.</p><p>Group communication, application protocols, and reliable consensus. While in the last decade the focus was on one-hop broadcast messages, with coordinated maneuvering and automated driving a group of vehicles needs to communicate reliably, with a specified application protocol, to achieve reliable consensus. As vehicular traffic is full of protocols, it is not surprising that maneuvering requires application protocols. However, group formation and dealing with the unreliable wireless channel opens up additional research questions.</p><p>Cognition and safety. Cooperation with experts on intelligent vehicles and automotive safety should be strengthened since application requirements come from detecting dangerous traffic situations (including pedestrians and bicyclists) as well as devising safe driving strategies.</p><p>Self-organizing systems. The promise made by the IVC community to design self-organizing networks is not enough for deployment or market entry, as many FOTs clearly show: the radical new design of the network alone and the sheer scale of the system require many innovations in the whole IT management chain. Here again, principles from self-organizing systems and the whole self-x movement might help while being complemented by existing IT management techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Flexible and adaptable communication architectures can adjust to changing contexts, technologies, and application mixes, allowing the system to evolve over time. This would also facilitate building networks that go beyond IVC and would lead toward a broader Internet of Things approach.</p><p>With future cooperative automated vehicles, all the aspects mentioned above require and deserve further efforts in the field of IVC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEST PRACTICES FOR FIELD OPERATIONAL TESTS</head><p>The performance evaluation of vehicular network technology and applications is a nontrivial challenge. Field testing a system plays an important role in such evaluations and in advancing scientific knowledge. It is not only necessary to assess network performance in a real environment, but also to discover previously unaccounted or unknown system properties. While some of these benefits can also be achieved with smallscale experimentation, only FOTs can evaluate systems at scale and cover a much wider range of scenarios.</p><p>Data collected in these trials can furthermore be used as input for the creation and validation of both analytical and simulation models, and therefore improve their quality and relevance. At the same time, conducting meaningful FOTs is challenging. They often involve complex systems with proprietary technology components, which can make it difficult to interpret the results and match them to analytical or simulation models.</p><p>As vehicular network research and development has moved into a stage of extensive field trials, this Working Group has discussed the potential impact on research, and ways to improve collaboration between academia and the operators of FOTs. We begin with a short overview of ongoing efforts and discuss why field testing can be a necessary and valuable asset for researchers in the scientific field. From those discussions we distill recommendations for both researchers and trial operators to further improve the value and benefit of future field trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PAST AND CURRENT EFFORTS</head><p>Ongoing field trials in vehicular networks span evaluation topics ranging from driver acceptance of applications to network performance in highly congested environments.</p><p>In the United States, the Safety Pilot Model Deployment at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor 2 has been hosting about 3000 vehicles equipped with dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) devices to test the effectiveness of the technology in real-world conditions to measure how drivers adapt to the technology, and to identify potential safety benefits. Results from this test are expected to influence NHTSA rule making.</p><p>In addition to this more application-oriented testing, the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP) Vehicle Safety Communications 3 (VSC3) Consortium is conducting field trials under the connected vehicle technology research program of the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT). This activity studies scalability aspects of vehicle safety communications that will preserve the performance of vehicle safety applications in both congested as well as uncongested communication environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In Europe, the German simTD project <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> studied vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infra-  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF USING FOT DATA</head><p>The benefits that the research community could gain from FOTs are manifold. Research groups studying IVC, and intelligent transportation system (ITS) technologies in general, could use the data collected during FOTs even after the end of the project, investigating aspects that were not covered by the original FOT objectives. An important requirement for this to be possible is that all needed meta data is logged and documented.</p><p>Simulative evaluation of communication strategies and applications in vehicular networks heavily relies on data collected in field trials to further bridge the gap between simulation and reality, and hence to increase the trustworthiness of simulation results. For example, the amount of work recently published on channel models for vehicular networks (including path loss analysis, and shadowing models for buildings and vehicles) requires real-world data to be validated. The more data available, the better these models can be adjusted and therefore improved. Also, medium access control (MAC) layer models would benefit from more extensive experimental validation. The results of not only network-oriented FOTs (e.g., CAMP VSC3) but also more general ones (e.g., DRIVE C2X <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, simTD <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) can therefore be extremely helpful to validate such models.</p><p>Not only can network models be improved with the help of field trials; they can also help advance mobility related research. Vehicle traces collected during field tests, for example, could be used to derive behavioral models, which are becoming extremely important for the evaluation of safety applications. Further possible benefits include the tuning of psychological driver models (e.g., the following of recommendations made by the onboard unit), the parameterization of car following models, or establishing a default mobility scenario to make simulations more comparable toward each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>However, data access requested by institutions not directly involved in the FOTs requires some preconditions. First, in-depth documentation of the published dataset is needed, not only with the present goals of the FOT in mind, but also considering that the data will be used for other purposes. This requires a detailed and exact description of the experiments and the data format. Of course, making data publicly available requires specific solutions for data storage policies and locations, as data must be available to download to a potentially wide number of research groups, even after the FOT has long been completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>In order to fully benefit from FOTs, researchers need to be more involved with the potentials, limitations, benefits, and drawbacks of this new data generated at FOTs. In addition, since the money and resources to conduct large-scale field trials are often not available to researchers, they must rely on and collaborate with industry and governmental institutions. Unfortunately, the goals of FOT outcomes are not necessarily the same for vehicular manufacturers, road operators, and researchers.</p><p>It is therefore essential that FOTs learn how to successfully convey the benefits of giving researchers access to FOT data. The community should compile a list of possible use cases for that, which will facilitate a request to collect a specific set of data and record the relevant meta data needed to achieve a certain goal and enable reproducible results. Furthermore, there is a need to better understand the goals and interests of the different stakeholders in FOTs from the beginning so that motivations to tightly restrict access to field test data can be identified and addressed.</p><p>Generated data and the respective scenarios comprising the conditions under which the data was collected should be documented in detail so that all stakeholders are able to work with the information easily. Naturally, this implies that resources should be allocated in project planning processes for data documentation as well as archival, maintenance, and distribution after the project.</p><p>In-depth general-purpose documentation helps to improve the flow of information from the stakeholders to third parties in academia. Traceability can also improve the exchange of knowledge from one (completed) FOT to another, something that often relies on stakeholders being active in both FOTs.</p><p>Due to the complexity of many large-scale tests, we recommend that validation activities (e.g., using simulation or analytical methods) are planned for and integrated even during the early testing stages of a field trial. Furthermore, small scale tests ("dress rehearsals") should be conducted (preferably already in an early project phase) in order to test processes and data collection deeply as well as pre-evaluate results. This also includes the allocation of time periods used to analyze and revise the system and experiment with design before conducting the final experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IVC APPLICATIONS</head><p>The IVC Applications Working Group discussed some key emerging issues related to different applications of VANETs in the marketplace. These discussions included safety, efficiency, and entertainment applications. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHY ARE DSRC APPLICATIONS NOT YET ON THE MARKET?</head><p>The group felt that IVC research, in general, is at crossroads since with the release of FCC NPRM 13-22 (Docket 13-49), the United States Federal Communications Commission has proposed allowing unlicensed technologies such as WiFi to share the 5.9 GHz ITS band, which is currently allocated for DSRC. To this end, the FCC is considering opening up this bandwidth for the use of WiFi for commercial applications, which could complicate the overall picture considerably.</p><p>On the other hand, the U.S. DOT has allocated about US$100 million for field trials at six different locations in the United States to demonstrate the huge benefits of using DSRCequipped vehicles to safety. The field trial in Detroit, Michigan, for instance, was initially designed as an 18-month experiment and has continued for the last year. It involves about 3000 drivers selected from different age groups, professions, education levels, gender, and so on in an effort to collect significant empirical data for demonstrating how the use of DSRC radios could increase the safety on the road (in urban areas and highways) significantly. The main motivation behind these massive field trials and the investment made by the U.S. DOT is to collect convincing data (in a statistical sense) to present to Congress for passing legislation for mandating the use of DSRC radios. If this effort succeeds, within a couple of years one can hope to see DSRC radios installed in every new car sold in the United States as a safety feature (similar to seat belts and air bags).</p><p>Another interesting development is the fact that several auto manufacturers are considering solutions based on cellular communications. As an example, several original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have recently announced agreements with cellular carriers to use equipment from those specific carriers in their vehicles for Internet access and other services. This entails the use of a Long Term Evolution (LTE) modem installed in cars and the use of LTE (or LTE-Advanced) networks of carriers for several services. This new development, however, does not seem to prioritize safety as the key application.</p><p>Based on these developments, two major outcomes seem plausible: • Based on the aforementioned field trials, assuming the collected data provide convincing evidence about the benefits of DSRC radios in reducing accidents and enhancing safety of driving, the U.S. DOT passes legislation and mandates the use of DSRC equipment in new cars. • DSRC applications are gradually introduced into the marketplace, and more and more drivers install DSRC radios in their vehicles as they see the benefit. This will involve after-market DSRC devices for legacy cars and perhaps the installation of DSRC radios only in new high-end cars.</p><p>In both cases, however, there has to be convincing evidence that safety can be improved substantially via the use of DSRC technology. In this sense, the six field trials in the United States (and other similar large field trials in other parts of the world) will carry a lot of weight in providing reliable and significant data to the U.S. federal government and to the public.</p><p>At this juncture, viable business models might also be important for convincing the stakeholders to go ahead and mandate DSRC technology. There was a general consensus that the "golden triangle" for mandating DSRC technology might be the government-car manufacturers-insurance companies, as the key stakeholders. However, while these stakeholders share the objective of social responsibility and acceptance of road traffic, they might not share a common view of how to share the risk that goes along with the introduction of a radically new communication network. The general impression was that the role of the government in serving as a catalyst cannot be overestimated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT CAN BE DONE IN RESEARCH?</head><p>It was noted that the networking and communications people in IVC research should have closer collaboration with the traffic safety people in the transportation domain (most of the current planning activity is done by these people and does NOT involve V2V or V2I communications) as these are the key people who determine how traffic planning is currently done and what are the underlying safety concerns. By better understanding their current thinking, the ongoing IVC research at universities could be more focused and directed to the current needs and shortcomings of the existing system.</p><p>A conscientious and orchestrated effort in this direction could certainly contribute to the adoption of DSRC technology. It has been conjectured that perhaps safety should not be the first application that research should emphasize. Instead, perhaps other applications enabled by DSRC (e.g., efficiency and entertainment) should come first, and safety should be tagged to these applications, which might have better potential as a revenue stream.</p><p>Another trend that was discussed is the growing interest in autonomous driving. Several car manufacturers have for years been pursuing R&amp;D on autonomous driving. It is clear, however, that autonomous vehicles so far do NOT emphasize the use of IVC, but rather rely on the presence of a very large number of sensors and actuators to "sense" their environment and navigate accordingly; hence the name "autonomous." It was noted that this might change in the coming years as IVC should and probably will become a major component in autonomous vehicles as well. This is because an autonomous vehicle is ultimately a mobile robot and in decision making, as a mobile robot its most challenging task is to make correct decisions at an intersection (especially at intersections that are not regulated with traffic lights or other traffic signals). It is clear that the rotating cameras, radars, and lidars which exist on autonomous vehicles are essentially line-of-sight devices and cannot always discern objects (and other vehicles) on orthogonal roads at an intersection that might be non-line-of-sight. The group decided that one should try to convince parties involved in autonomous driving about the huge benefits that could be reaped by the use of DSRC/wireless access in the vehicular environment (DSRC/WAVE) technology and IVC. Thus, a conscientious effort on how to integrate IVC to autonomous driving would be timely and helpful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COOPERATIVE AUTOMATED DRIVING</head><p>Continuing along this promising direction, potential new applications were also discussed where integration of IVC with autonomous driving can easily be achieved. Lane merging was identified as one application where autonomous driving would benefit from the presence of DSRC technology and IVC. All collaborative applications that require cooperation could also benefit from "cooperative autonomous" driving. An interesting observation that was made is the fact that autonomous driving by definition is currently a local concept, whereas integrating it with IVC could lead to large-scale benefits as it makes the autonomous vehicles much more aware of the state of the network.</p><p>It is no secret that certain capabilities that make autonomous vehicles truly "autonomous" are the massive and sometimes expensive sensors. Using DSRC radios might obviate the use of some of these expensive sensors in autonomous vehicles, thus reducing the cost of autonomous vehicles substantially, which, in turn, might accelerate their massive adoption and use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HETEROGENEOUS VEHICULAR NETWORKS</head><p>A future trend of vehicular networks is moving away from focusing on just a single technology and toward designing systems that can make use of multiple different technologies, creating heterogeneous vehicular networks. Looking into the literature, however, the underlying assumptions, concepts, and even goals of such approaches are fuzzy. This Working Group was formed in an effort to move this research area forward by clarifying the foundations, identifying commonalities and differences of existing approaches, and outlining future research directions.</p><p>In the context of networking in general, the term heterogeneous networking is sometimes used as a catch-all definition: for example, there is a clear consensus within the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to define integrated large-cell/small-cell coverage in LTE-Advanced and its related issues as HetNets. Such definitions do not apply to our case. In vehicular networking it was agreed that a heterogeneous vehicular network refers to a system characterized by the integration of different technologies such as IEEE 802.11p DSRC (together with higher-layer protocols such as WAVE or ITS G5), IEEE 802.11abgn consumer WiFi, and 3G/4G cellular networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHY HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS</head><p>One of the key motivations for considering such heterogeneous vehicular networks is the widespread availability of multiple technologies -both on today's portable devices like smart phones and in modern cars' satellite navigation systems or multimedia units. Furthermore, the team was quick to agree that while cellular networks such as LTE will be a big help during any initial rollout of short-range communication technology, cellular networks will, in the medium term, not be able to offer sufficient network capacity without a drastic increase in deployment density and/or price <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Even in the long term, they might be unable to offer sufficient capacity.</p><p>Heterogeneous vehicular networking is further motivated by the fact that each of the currently available wireless technologies offers unique benefits, but also unique drawbacks. It was argued that the reasons to have WiFi lie in the downloading of value-added content and the creation of a truly integrated environment, which would not be limited to cars as the only road users: indeed, WiFi would foster the integration of bicycles and pedestrians into the network. Furthermore, because of its tailored physical layer, dedicated channel(s), and tight locality, DSRC can offer unique benefits in safety and cooperation awareness applications due to their tight latency requirements. On the other end of the spectrum, cellular technologies are widely available and designed for delivering large amounts of data over arbitrary distances. On the down side, they could face further hurdles when multicasting or local broadcasting is a strong requirement. Indeed, the lack of specific multicast support even in current 3G and 4G networks, coupled with multi-operator terminals, is a critical limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The team identified two basic opposing trends in heterogeneous vehicular networking that can be classified as follows (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>): • Class A pushes for a generalized network stack that abstracts away from lower layers to decouple applications from the employed technology, aiming to provide data offloading services or an always best connected experience to upper layers. • Class B follows a best of both worlds approach, exposing information and control of lower layers to applications, enabling them to selectively use the best fitting technology for a particular task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASS A</head><p>Having multiple technologies at hand gives vehicles the option to communicate in an always best connected fashion. This allows them to efficiently combat hard-to-predict local shadowing and fading effects. Furthermore, it allows them to operate even in sparse networks, unhindered by network fragmentation or similar problems that would plague purely DSRC-based solutions early after market rollout. Also, using multiple technologies in parallel for sending can make the delivery of "one in a million" safety messages much more robust. It can further help thwart physical layer attacks or serve to cross-validate potentially fraudulent messages.</p><p>The discussion then moved to the use of DSRC for cellular offloading to increase capacity. The consensus was that previous work already explored cellular offloading, but the main applications seem to involve some variations of the caching-and-forwarding concept. However, in order to be effective, caching must be applied to popular content. It was remarked that there are no reliable studies of how "popular" content must be to turn offloading into a viable option.</p><p>In a similar vein, it is possible to use one technology to deliver a basic level of service, and another for optional enhanced levels of service, such as the base layer and enhanced layers of scalable video coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASS B</head><p>As an alternative to the more straightforward always best connected abstract approach discussed above, heterogeneous networks could also instrument multiple technologies much more directly, employing each to its full capacity, and according to its particular benefits and drawbacks. We categorized approaches further into two sub-classes:</p><p>Class B1 chooses the underlying technology according to a control/data split. Sending control information via a cellular channel, if available, can ensure that control information reaches the highest number of nodes, independent of network topology, and even kilometers in advance. Sending data via multihop DSRC can serve to ensure that the network load caused by such data exchange remains local only. One example of such a network is the MobTorrent approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which employs a cellular network for transmitting control data to WiFi access points, allowing them to prefetch and cache data to offer Internet access to vehicles. A more recent example turns this architecture on its head, utilizing DSRC for service announcements and a cellular network for supporting infotainment data dissemination <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Class B2 splits data according to a local/global decision. Local collaboration via DSRC/WAVE if necessary (as well as available) can make best use of the low latency offered by this technology. Medium-scale or global collaboration via cellular networks, transmitting only aggregate information, can supplement local collaboration: it can exploit the universal availability of cellular networks without causing undue load and without suffering from its drawbacks for local communication. One example of such a network is a clustering approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which employs short-range radio for near-field information exchange in clusters and cellular networks for interconnecting clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TOWARD HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS</head><p>The group meeting adjourned after identifying the following promising research directions for heterogeneous vehicular networks: • Combining technologies with long-range and short-range coverage: They have different objectives, but a positive effect is expected from their joint deployment. • Investigation of the feasibility of integrating a high number of different radio technologies into one device; investigation of software defined radio (SDR) as a potential way forward <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. • Further investigation of offloading, scheduled downloading, and relaying is needed, identifying promising use cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. • Continuing development of safety protocols and applications. Heterogeneous networks also imply a technoorganizational challenge of how to bring together the diverse standardization bodies and committees involved in the heterogeneous networking world of intelligent transportation. This issue goes along with the question of the "right layer" for standardization, indicated in the above classification of approaches.</p></div>
