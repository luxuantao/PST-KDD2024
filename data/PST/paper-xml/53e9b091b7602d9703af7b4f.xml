<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Numerous robotic tasks associated with underactuation have been studied in the literature. For a large number of these in the plane, the mechanical models have a cyclic variable, the cyclic variable is unactuated, and all shape variables are independently actuated. This paper formulates and solves two control problems for this class of models. If the generalized momentum conjugate to the cyclic variable is not conserved, conditions are found for the existence of a set of outputs that yields a system with a one-dimensional exponentially stable zero dynamics-i.e., an exponentially minimum-phase system-along with a dynamic extension that renders the system locally input-output decouplable. If the generalized momentum conjugate to the cyclic variable is conserved, a reduced system is constructed and conditions are found for the existence of a set of outputs that yields an empty zero dynamics, along with a dynamic extension that renders the system feedback linearizable. A common element in these two feedback problems is the construction of a scalar function of the configuration variables that has relative degree three with respect to one of the input components. The function arises by partially integrating the conjugate momentum. The results are illustrated on two balancing tasks and on a ballistic flip motion.</p></div>

Examples include dismounting from a high bar or platform diving. In these cases, the underactuation is manifest in the lack of contact with any surface. The ballistic phase is normally of short duration since reestablishing contact with a surface (e.g., ground, mat, water,</p><p>) is an objective of the maneuver. A typical control problem would be to execute a predefined motion, with emphasis on achieving a final state that is compatible with an elegant landing on a mat (no rebounding or slipping), or re-entry into the water (no splash). Similar things can be said for back flips, tumbling, and somersaults.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to the control of mechanical systems that are capable of executing such dexterous maneuvers in the plane. The literature on underactuated (a.k.a., super-articulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>) systems and nonholonomic systems is vast. A few representative control works include the study of accessibility in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, stabilization of equilibria through passivity techniques in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and energy shaping in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, stabilization and tracking via backstepping in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, the use of virtual constraints to achieve stabilization of orbits in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, and path planning in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Representative works in the robotics area are cited in Section II. One of the novelties of the present paper is to recognize that balancing on a pivot while executing a motion and planning a back flip share a common mathematical problem: Designing a set of outputs that results in a minimal zero dynamics: Exponentially minimum phase and one dimensional in the first case, and empty, in the second. In part, this is of course related to the maximal feedback linearization problem, which has been solved completely when static state feedback is considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, while only partial results are known when dynamic state feedback is allowed, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and references therein. The additional requirement being achieved here is that the "nonfeedback linearizable part" of the system is exponentially stable, and no general results are available on this aspect.</p><p>Section II identifies a special class of mechanical systems with one degree of underactuation that underlies the study of dexterous maneuvers in the plane as discussed previously. The key feature is that the systems possess a cyclic variable and this variable is unactuated <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Section III formulates and solves two related control problems. If the generalized momentum conjugate to the cyclic variable is not conserved, conditions are found for the existence of a set of outputs that yields an exponentially minimum phase system with a one-dimensional zero dynamics, along with a dynamic extension that renders the system locally input-output decouplable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MOTIVATING CLASSES OF SYSTEMS</head><p>This section uses two classes of systems to set the stage for the mathematical and control developments that follow. The first class consists of planar rigid bodies connected in a tree structure-no closed kinematic chains-with the base attached to an inertial reference frame via a pivot, that is, an unactuated revolute joint. It is supposed that each link has nonzero mass, and that each connection of two links is independently actuated so that the system has one degree of underactuation ( degrees of freedom with independent actuators). It is further supposed that all joints are frictionless, but this assumption is really only important at the pivot. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows an example of such a system. Though not indicated in the figure, massless springs may be attached between links and between links and the inertial reference frame; prismatic joints between links are also allowed. This class of systems clearly includes the Acrobot <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, the brachiating robots of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, the gymnast robots of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> when pivoting on a high Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Planar tree stucture in ballistic motion. All joints are actuated. A coordinate convention is indicated. Though not shown, prismatic joints can be included as can springs that act between links but not between a link and the inertial frame. bar, and the stance phase models of Raibert's one-legged hopper <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, as well as RABBIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The control objectives will be to stabilize the system about an equilibrium point or to track a set of reference trajectories with internal stability. The second class of systems consists of planar rigid bodies, once again connected in a tree structure, but this time, it is assumed that the mechanism is undergoing ballistic motion. As before, it is supposed that that each link has nonzero mass and each connection of two links is independently actuated. In addition, it is assumed that there are no springs between any link and an inertial reference frame. Such a system has three degrees of underactuation: degrees of freedom and independent actuators. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows an example of such a system. This class of systems clearly includes the gymnast robot of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> when dismounting from the high bar, the planar diver of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the flip gait of the robot in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the ballistic phase of the four-link planar robot in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, and the ballistic phase of running in planar biped robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Raibert's hopper <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The control objective will be to maximally linearize the system so as to facilitate the construction of a trajectory that transfers the state of the system from one point to another in finite time.</p><p>Consider the -link system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, along with the indicated coordinates,</p><p>, where, for convenience, the reference frame has been attached at the pivot point. The kinetic energy is quadratic, , with positive definite. Since the kinetic energy is independent of the orientation of the reference frame, is independent of ; that is . The coordinate is said to be cyclic <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (a.k.a., external in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>) whereas are called shape variables. The form of the potential energy depends on whether the system is evolving under the action of gravity (for example, in a vertical plane versus a horizontal plane) and whether or not springs have been attached at the joints. Electromagnetic and electrostatic forces are excluded, and hence, the potential energy depends only on the configuration variables. Mechanical systems where the kinetic energy is quadratic in the velocities and the potential energy depends only on the configuration variables are said to be simple.</p><p>Denote the Lagrangian by , and assume that the system is actuated such that where . Consider next the -link system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, along with the indicated coordinates,</p><p>, where are the Cartesian coordinates of the center of mass. Suppose further that there are no springs between a link and an inertial reference frame. Then, the equations of motion decompose as <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where in a vertical plane is the gravitational constant and if the system is evolving on a horizontal plane without friction, then . As in the first class of systems considered, is also a cyclic variable of because the kinetic energy is independent of the chosen orientation of the inertial reference frame.</p><p>The important point is that the dynamics of the body coordinates, , and the Cartesian coordinates of the center of mass, , are decoupled. Since the center of mass coordinates are unactuated, the control of the system (3) can be reduced to the control of a system having one degree of underactuation as in (2) by eliminating the trivial dynamics , . In this sense, the two systems in Figs. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref> are very similar: They give rise to control problems for systems with DOF, actuators, and the cyclic coordinate is unactuated. One way in which the systems are often different is that angular momentum about the center of mass of (3) is always conserved, whereas (2) may or may not have a conserved quantity depending on the potential energy. For example, consider a system as in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> in a horizontal plane without friction; suppose furthermore there are no springs between any link and the inertial reference frame. Then, the angular momentum about the pivot point is a conserved quantity, and thus this feature-conservation of angular momentum-is possible in (2) as well. Conservation of angular momentum gives rise to a nonholonomic constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and changes fundamentally the nature of the control problem.</p><p>In summary, the models of the simple mechanical systems represented by Figs. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref> present the common feature of an unactuated, cyclic variable. System (2) has one degree of underactuation whereas even though system (3) has three degrees of underactuation, in the proper coordinates, the control problem decouples into the control of a system of the form (2) plus keeping track of the evolution of the center of mass variables. These observations are used in the next section to motivate the class of models analyzed. As a final remark, it is worth noting that <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> has shown quite clearly that even for systems with two degrees of freedom, if the cyclic coordinate and the unactuated coordinate do not coincide-such as in the inverted pendulum on a cart-then the system possesses quite different properties from a control point of view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CONTROL OF SIMPLE MECHANICAL SYSTEMS WITH AN UNACTUATED CYCLIC VARIABLE</head><p>Consider the classes of mechanical systems motivated in Section II. Roughly speaking, the goal is to determine a set of outputs that gives rise to a zero dynamics of "smallest possible" dimension, and if this dimension is nonzero, also to assure that the zero dynamics is stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. More precisely, in the case of a system where the generalized momentum conjugate to the cyclic variable is not conserved, a set of outputs will be found that leads to local dynamic input-output decouplability and a one-dimensional exponentially stable zero dynamics, and for systems where the conjugate momentum is conserved, a set of flat outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> will be determined; that is, a set of outputs will be found that leads to the construction of a regular dynamic feedback and a local change of coordinates in which the system is linear.</p><p>Before proceeding, it is worth noting that if outputs are chosen to correspond to the actuated variables, that is, , for , then each component has relative degree two and the associated decoupling matrix is invertible (one says the system has vector relative degree (2, ,2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). Such a choice leads to a two-dimensional zero dynamics, which, moreover, can be shown to be once again a Lagrangian system <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and, thus, can never have an asymptotically stable equilibrium. One way to get around this problem is to construct a set of outputs such that the associated zero dynamics has dimension one and, hence, is not Lagrangian. For special cases, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> shows how to construct an output component that has relative degree three with respect to one of the input components. This idea is developed in much more generality here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Partial Integration of a One-Form</head><p>This subsection presents a key result that will lead to the construction of outputs for the system (2) so that the associated zero dynamics has dimension one and, hence, may admit an asymptotically stable equilibrium point. As will be seen in the next subsection, the abstract one-form considered here naturally arises from consideration of momentum. The result formalizes and extends previous work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The following lemma can be viewed as a special case of the Pfaff-Darboux Theorem, whose role in control systems theory was first highlighted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. As a point of notation, given a collection of smooth real-valued functions defined on some open set , denotes the corresponding codistribution as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>; that is, the span is computed point-wise over .

The integral in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is well-defined at each point in because the integrand is smooth and the integral is evaluated over a closed and bounded interval.

Model Class and a Normal Form</head><p>Consider a simple 1  DOF Lagrangian system with independent actuators, where the unactuated variable is a cyclic coordinate of the kinetic energy. Specifically, let the configuration space be , an open connected subset of , with local coordinates denoted by , and take canonical coordinates on .

Let the potential energy, , depend only on the configuration variables and be smooth. Denote the Lagrangian by and assume that the system is actuated according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The model can then be written as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.

Note also that does not depend on because is cyclic. Denote the generalized momentum conjugate to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> by . Because the kinetic energy is quadratic and the potential energy depends only on the configuration variables, it follows that <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> From the assumption on the actuation and the assumption that is cyclic <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> For later use, note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> implies that the relative degree of is at least three.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> Using ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) to express the normal form in terms of the state variables , instead of , shows that ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is (globally) static state feedback equivalent to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> which was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and will be called the modified normal form. Since only a change of state variables has been made, the feedback required to go from (2) to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> is the same as that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>Associate to the one-form and the normalized one-form Applying Lemma 1 for , define the function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Direct computation then leads to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where Note that since does not depend on , it must be differentiated at least twice more before appears; in other words, has at least relative degree three with respect to .</p><p>This concludes the preliminary analysis required for subsequent feedback design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Systems Where the Generalized Momentum Conjugate to the Cyclic Variable is not Conserved</head><p>It is first assumed that , the generalized momentum conjugate to , is not constant along solutions of the model (1); that is <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> It is also assumed that there exists a static equilibrium point corresponding to some constant value of the control, and that when defining via <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, is taken as so that vanishes 3 at the equilibrium point. In this case, conditions will be identified under which the set of outputs . . . <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> a constant, yields an exponentially minimum phase system. More precisely, conditions will be given such that the zero dynamics is well defined in a neighborhood of the given equilibrium point, has dimension one, and is exponentially 3 Alternatively, let q be arbitrary, for example, zero, and define y = K(p 0 p ) + , where p is the value at the equilibrium point, q . stable for all , and moreover, the system is dynamically input-output decouplable (equivalently, invertible).</p><p>Before proceeding with the analysis, the intuition behind this choice of outputs is discussed. As stated earlier, a more standard choice of outputs would be , for , where each component has relative degree two. Such a choice leads to a two-dimensional zero dynamics, which can be shown to be once again a Lagrangian system <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, and thus can never have an asymptotically stable equilibrium. By seeking an output component with a relative degree higher than two, the dimension of the zero dynamics can be reduced, opening up the possibility of either having no zero dynamics at all, or, of creating one that is scalar and asymptotically stable. For the class of systems being studied, no output function of relative degree four has been found (see Section V-B for more discussion on this point). The most obvious relative degree three function available is the conjugate momentum , which is a linear combination of the velocity components. If the first component of the outputs were modified to , the resulting zero dynamics manifold would include a one-dimensional submanifold of equilibria associated with and, thus, asymptotic stability of the zero dynamics would be impossible. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, by associating to a one-form and then partially integrating it, a function was determined that depends only on the configuration variables and has at least relative degree three with respect to one of the input components (after a static feedback was used to put the system in normal form). Hence, any function of and has at least relative degree three with respect to that input component. Moreover, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, if , for , then is proportional to through the strictly positive quantity . Thus the choice , , and , for , should lead to the exponentially stable zero dynamics . The main result is now stated. Theorem 1: Consider the simple mechanical system (2) with DOF, independent actuators and the unactuated coordinate is cyclic. Associate to the system the outputs defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, with , and define (16) Then, in a neighborhood of any equilibrium point at which is nonzero, the system is i) exponentially minimum phase; ii) dynamically, input-output decouplable. Moreover, once the system is transformed into the normal form of ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), or into the modified normal form of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, then the dynamic extension . . . <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> renders it statically input-output decouplable.</p><p>Proof: The zero dynamics is invariant under regular static state feedback and dynamic extensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Hence, assume the system has already been transformed into the normal form <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and then apply the dynamic extension <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. It follows that , for . It remains to differentiate the first output component. Equation ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> The arguments will now be dropped so that the formulas remain compact and readable. Differentiating <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> again yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> Due to the dynamic extension <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, have at least relative degree three and has at least relative degree two, thus the inputs do not appear in . Differentiating once more and keeping track only of the terms where the inputs appear yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Therefore, the decoupling matrix is <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> and is invertible at a given point if, and only if, is nonzero at that point. In a neighborhood of an equilibrium point , is nonzero if, and only if <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> Wherever the decoupling matrix is invertible, the zero dynamics is locally well defined and the set of differentials, , is independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and, hence, has dimension . System <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> with the dynamic extension (17) has dimension , and thus the zero dynamics has dimension one.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXAMPLES</head><p>This section will illustrate the theoretical results of Section III on systems of the type depicted in Figs. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref>. The systems are chosen to be simple enough that the calculations are straightforward and sufficiently complex to illustrate a range of possible applications of the main theorems. The first example treats a robot with two rigid links connected via an actuated revolute joint and attached at one end to a pivot; that is, the Acrobot. A novel feature is that the robot is placed on a frictionless horizontal plane to remove gravity. If nothing else were done, the angular momentum about the attachment point would be conserved, so stabilization about an equilibrium would not be possible. A spring is therefore added between the world frame and the first link, and a stabilizing controller is then designed through the use of Theorem 1. The second example treats a robot consisting of three serial links connected by independently actuated revolute joints, attached to a pivot, and constrained to evolve in a vertical plane. For this system, the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> are not applicable for designing a stabilizing controller. Theorem 1 is applied to design a controller that achieves stabilization about an equilibrium point and asymptotic tracking of trajectories. The last problem studied focuses on ballistic motion in a vertical plane, which is a key part of a model of running. The model assumes a robot with two rigid links connected via an actuated revolute joint. The angular momentum about the center of mass is conserved, creating a nonholonomic constraint. Corollary 1 is applied to feedback linearize the accessible part of the system. The linear representation of the dynamics is shown to be advantageous for path planning. The singularities that prevent the system from being globally linearized are explicitly noted and how to plan a path through such a singularity is illustrated.</p></div>

The control law design consists of the preliminary feedback needed to place the system in the (modified) normal form (as explained in the Appendix), the selection of two outputs, the dynamic extension that renders the system statically decouplable (and, hence, statically input-output linearizable), and a second static state feedback used to linearize and stabilize the inputoutput map.

How these two parts interact in a path planning problem is explained next.</p><p>2) Interaction Through Boundary Conditions: The flight phases of a gymnastic robot, such as a tumbler or a bipedal runner, are typically short-term motions that alternate with single support phases. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">4</ref> The creation of an overall satisfactory motion is closely tied to achieving correct boundary conditions at the interfaces of the flight and single support phases. The state of the robot at the end of a flight phase determines the initial conditions for the single support phase, and consequently the state of the robot at the end of a flight phase is typically more important than the exact trajectory followed during the flight phase.</p><p>At the beginning and end of a flight phase, the robot is in contact with a surface, assumed here to be identified with the horizontal component of the world frame. Assume furthermore that the robot is in single support, with the contact point being either the mass or . In single support, there are two holonomic constraints that tie the position and velocity of the center of mass to those of the angular coordinates; in other words, there is a loss of two degrees of freedom. Conservation of angular momentum through yields an additional (nonholonomic) constraint on the angular velocities. In particular, the desired final joint velocities must be chosen to satisfy this constraint.</p><p>The duration of the flight phase is determined from , with the initial conditions coming from the initial positions and velocities of the angular coordinates at lift-off, and the end condition of the height of the center mass coming from the desired final configuration of the angular coordinates at touchdown. Once the flight time is known, determining whether or not there exists a solution of the reduced model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref> that is compatible with a given set of initial and final conditions is a difficult problem: Once a trajectory for is chosen, must be numerically integrated, and if does not have the desired value, then must be altered. Such an iterative procedure is poorly adapted to online computations. Theorem 2 will be applied to simplify this task. It should be noted that the value of the momentum is unknown before the start of the flight phase, and thus it is not even possible to determine the reduced model ( <ref type="formula">54</ref>) before the initial condition of the robot is known at lift-off.</p><p>3) Determining a Ballistic Motion Trajectory in Linearizing Coordinates: Local, input-output linearizing coordinates for the reduced model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref> are constructed from and its first two derivatives.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wherever</head><p>, a linearizing feedback can be constructed such that (59) For arbitrary initial and final conditions of the linear model (59), it is trivial to define a feasible trajectory.

Checking Feedback Linearizability</head><p>This section offers a few observations on the generic nonfeedback linearizability of the model class studied here when generalized conjugate momentum is not conserved. The reason to check this property is that if the systems were feedback linearizable, then it would be possible to achieve an empty zero dynamics instead of a zero dynamics with dimension one. Recall that for single-input systems, it is known that a system is dynamically feedback linearizable if, and only if, it is statically feedback linearizable. For multiple-input systems, dynamic feedback does enlarge the class of linearizable systems, but necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic feedback linearizability are not known. If one restricts the outputs used to achieve dynamic feedback linearizability (often called flat outputs) to being only functions of the configuration variables, however, then for mechanical systems with one degree of underactuation, necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic feedback linearization are known <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>; in particular, for the class of systems being studied in this paper, the conclusion is that there do not generally exist flat outputs depending only on the configuration variables.</p><p>Consider first a two-DOF system written in the form of (64), and suppose that . Such a system has a single input and, thus, necessary and sufficient conditions for feedback linearizability can be checked. Applying the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> , in which case is a linearizing (or flat) output. These conditions are not generally satisfied for the class of systems being studied; in particular, applying them to the two link example of Section IV-B proves that it is not feedback linearizable.</p><p>Consider next a system with three-DOF written either in the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> or (64). Applying once again the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the system is statically feedback linearizable only if (68) moreover, the same obstruction persists if an integrator is added on so the dynamic extension used in this paper does not render the system static feedback linearizable. The obstruction (68) is present in the three-link example of Section IV-C.</p><p>We know of only two mechanical systems that meet the conditions of this paper and are feedback linearizable: The inertia wheel pendulum <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and the RTAC or TORA (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the references therein). Both systems satisfy the condition 5 The Lyapunov function used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> was not shown to be proper or radially unbounded. For the Acrobot, a periodicity property of G can be used to fill this lacuna when the dynamic model is extended in the obvious way to I R .</p><p>, and thus is a linearizing output. The method of this paper also finds the locally linearizing coordinates. This is shown only for the inertia wheel pendulum.</p><p>In the coordinates of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the modified normal form of the inertia wheel pendulum is (69) where (70) and the parameters are as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Since and are constant, ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is trivially integrated about the equilibrium point to obtain</p><p>Defining the output as and using ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">20</ref>), the model (69) in the coordinates becomes (72)</p><p>At the upright equilibrium, and, hence, (72) is linear in the coordinates after the application of a static state feedback.</p><p>Remark 9: More generally, the underlying reason for the static feedback linearizability of the inertia wheel pendulum can be tied to be the following result, which applies to DOF mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Consider again the one-form associated with the generalized conjugate momentum (9) and suppose that is closed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Let</head><p>. Then, a simple computation shows that: a) has at least relative degree four; b) the outputs , , have decoupling matrix (21) with ; c) when the decoupling matrix is invertible, these outputs have vector relative degree (4, 2, , 2) and, thus, the system is static feedback linearizable; and d) the coordinate transformation required to linearize the system is canonical and given by , , where . For the inertia wheel pendulum, is closed because the first row of the inertia matrix is constant; moreover, the relative degree four function is proportional to . In the case of the RTAC, the first row of the inertia matrix is not constant in the appropriate coordinates, but is still closed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>Motivated by a large number of dexterous robots that have been introduced in the literature over the past fifteen years, this paper has analyzed simple planar mechanical systems with an unactuated cyclic variable and an independent actuator for each shape variable. This class of models is naturally associated with balancing tasks and includes -link extensions of the Acrobot, the stance phase of Raibert's hopper and many other robots. Typical control objectives include stabilizing an equilibrium and asymptotically tracking a predefined motion. Through a simple decomposition procedure, models with an unactuated cyclic variable and an independent actuator for each shape variable also arise for certain systems executing a ballistic motion, such as diving, dismounting from a high bar, and tumbling. For these systems, since momentum is conserved, since the initial conditions are usually determined by the end of a single support phase, and since the ballistic phase is usually of short duration, asymptotically tracking a predefined motion is not a reasonable objective. Instead, the main problem is to determine if a of initial and final conditions is compatible, and if so, to generate online a trajectory that joins them.</p><p>The paper presented two novel control results. When the generalized momentum conjugate to the cyclic variable was not conserved, conditions were found for the existence of a set of outputs that yielded a one-dimensional, exponentially stable zero dynamics, along with a dynamic extension that rendered the system locally input-output decouplable. By existing results, a controller that achieves asymptotic stabilization and tracking is then easily constructed. When the generalized momentum conjugate to the cyclic variable was conserved, a reduced system was constructed and conditions were found for the existence of a set of outputs that yielded an empty zero dynamics, along with a dynamic extension that rendered the system locally input-output decouplable. By existing results, a local coordinate transformation and dynamic feedback controller that linearize the input-to-state map are then easily constructed. The solutions to these two control problems had a common underlying element: The computation of a function of the configuration variables that had relative degree three with respect to one of the input components. It was interesting that this function arose by partially integrating a physical quantity, the conjugate momentum.</p><p>The theoretical results were illustrated on three simple examples. Stabilization of an equilibrium was demonstrated on a variant of the Acrobot without the influence of gravity. The purpose of the example was to emphasize the role of the potential energy in determining whether generalized momentum is conserved, and to demonstrate the computations needed to apply the results of the paper in the simplest possible setting. Asymptotic stabilization about an equilibrium and asymptotic tracking were both illustrated on a serial, three-link, mechanism attached to a pivot and constrained to evolve in a vertical plane. This example provided a nontrivial illustration of the results for a system with multiple inputs. The last example illustrated how locally linearizing coordinates can simplify the path planning problem for a ballistic flip motion of a two-link mechanism. The singularities in the decoupling matrix were explicitly computed and related to configuration changes of the mechanism.</p></div>
