The first implementations of the energy minimization methods such as belief propagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and graph cuts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in stereo matching have provided a significant progress in disparity map estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However the occlusion problem introduces uncertainty in the choice of the constraint parameters: overpenalization of the smoothness term can help to overcome the ambiguity in occluded regions but this leads to errors for fine disparity structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivation</head><p>In stereo matching for each pixel we have to choose between several possible correspondences based on decision values (costs). There are three well known base problems in stereo matching, which make a naive pixel-wise correspondence search useless: noise, occlusion, and inherent matching uncertainty due to the possible local color sparseness of scenes.</p><p>To overcome these problems the pixel-wise cost is augmented by a local support region (as proposed by the cost filtering methods) or disparity smoothness is imposed (as proposed by the energy minimization techniques).</p><p>Analyzing these main solutions to stereo matching we observe that:</p><p>• Cost filtering and energy minimization methods work in different ways while addressing noise, occlusion and uncertainty problems. The main assumption of most cost filtering methods (mostly based on bilateral filtering) is that the same color possesses the same disparity, which assumes smoothness primarily in the color space. This works reasonably well, especially when addressing considerable occlusion. However due to the large spatial extend of the bilateral filters required to overcome occlusion this may produce outliers due to violation of the disparity smoothness in the color space. On the other hand, energy minimization approaches produce errors especially in the occluded regions of scenes. • Both cost filtering and energy minimization approaches under certain constraints can be considered as iterative filters over stereo matching cost volume with local support windows. Vice versa the two approaches under different constraints can be represented as the global energy minimization algorithms. These observations give rise to the idea that the drawbacks of both approaches can be compensated by unifying cost filtering and energy minimization methods together into a single twostep energy minimization technique. First, we show that cost filtering can be rewritten as an energy minimization problem.</p><p>The output of this minimization problem yields a more robust unary potential -especially in the presence of occlusionwhich we will then apply as the input to a standard energy minimization algorithm to compute the final disparity map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contribution</head><p>We show that for certain constraints there exists exact equivalence between message passing and the cost filtering based on the bilateral filter equation. This allows us to reformulate cost filtering as an energy minimization problem. Based on this observation we propose to perform stereo matching as a twostep global optimization (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In the first step we solve the energy minimization problem for the fully connected MRF model. In the second step, the marginal function values are used as the likelihood in a locally connected MRF model. The second step of our global optimization can also be considered as the cost aggregation filtering in the correlation volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The core of our method is the two step energy minimization approach to stereo matching. We theoretically show that the bilateral filtering is the feasible solution of the functional minimization under specific cost constraints. In addition, we found experimentally that the required step-transform of the initial cost obtains significantly better results than generally used cost transforms.</p><p>We propose to perform stereo matching as a two-step minimization procedure: first a fully connected model (FCM) is used for cost filtering after which a locally connected model is applied to compute the final disparity maps. Consecutive application (without post processing) of the FCM and the LCM in our method considerably outperforms the pure analogues of the methods which are published on the Middlebury evaluation table (the average rank for the LCM more than 120 and for the bilateral filtering more than 80 in comparison with our 43). The main reason of the obtained result is that the combination of the two models reduces the errors which can arise in the separate processes. The cost calculation part of this scheme will be explained in Section III, and the fully connected MRF processing in Section IV.A, the locally connected MRF processing in Section IV.B. Post processing steps are explained in Section V. Experimental results are presented in Section VI and conclusions are presented in Section VII.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>Cost-volume filtering approaches were summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In this paper authors showed the relationship and similarity between the energy minimization techniques and local filtering methods, but they did not try to merge the approaches. To prevent the computational complexity of the bilateral filtering algorithm a guided filter approach was proposed in the paper. The overall performance of the algorithm was relatively high for the class of cost filter based methods; however it was achieved due to the additional post-processing. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> the classic bilateral filter (they call it cost aggregation) was applied. To speed up the filtering process authors restrict the label space and make the filter support region sparse. We can consider the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> as the best of pure cost-volume filtering approaches. And it is opportunity to compare with our two-step process, because they did not apply post-processing.</p><p>As a pure energy minimization method we can consider two pioneer paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> they propose to minimize the energy function by an accurate graph cut algorithm called alpha expansion. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> the occlusion problem was solved properly by introducing occlusion penalization term in the energy functional, thus this algorithm performs better than <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Generally cost aggregation and global optimization are considered as different techniques. Nevertheless, in two stateof-the-art works authors have proposed methods to combine local preprocessing within a global optimization framework. They combine segmentation based cost aggregation with BP energy minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Firstly, an initial image is divided into relatively small segments also called superpixels; and then an aggregated cost is used for the unary potential in the energy minimization problem. There are two problems that one faces implementing this approach: firstly, segmentation is not a trivial problem especially in context of stereo matching; secondly, the assumption that pixels inside the same segment belong to similar disparity values can possibly produce estimation errors, which are impossible to correct at the stage of disparity map post-processing.</p><p>In this paper we show that bilateral filtering can be written as an energy minimization problem on a fully connected MRF. A solution to fully connected MRF models is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Unfortunately, the minimization algorithm, which they propose, is not optimal for the locally connected smoothness term: graph cut or sequential believe propagation provide noticeably better result in terms of minimization accuracy. On the other hand, the conventional stereo matching methods based on energy minimization are defined on a locally connected model and cannot be implemented on the globally connected model due to unsolvable computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper we propose to unify the approaches in one pipeline consecutively: firstly the energy min-marginals of the globally connected model are calculated, and then these values are used as an input cost for the second step of energy optimization with locally connected model.</p><p>The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> can be considered as a prototype of our calculation scheme. The initial cost is filtered by a bilateral kernel and then is used in the data term of the energy functional. However, this functional is not directly related with the initial correlation volume as in our method. Furthermore, the mentioned scheme differs considerably from ours. The data term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is not only the filtered cost but the merging result of the disparity map initialization by bilateral filtering, a post processing filter of this map and the filtered cost itself. Another important difference with our approach is the cost transform. We formulate our problem as an energy minimization and the bilateral filter is not a preprocessing step but a part of a message passing procedure under several constraints over cost values. In our experiment we show that the proposed cost transform contributes to the obtained state-of-the-art results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROBLEM DEFINITION</head><p>In the framework of the global approach the stereo matching problem is formulated in terms of energy minimization with § the energy function of the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E (l) = p∈V u p (l p ) + (p,q)∈E B p,q (l p , l q )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where set p ∈ V corresponds to pixels and set (p, q) ∈ E to edges of an image graph G = (E, V) ; l p denotes the label of pixel p which belongs to some discrete set of disparities l ∈ L; u p (•) defines a unary potential which corresponds to the conventional penalty cost; B p,q (•, •) is a binary potential which defines edge interaction between pixels (p, q).</p><p>A choice of the unary potential (cost) in stereo matching is very important sub-problem. There are two kinds of costs: a per-pixel matching dissimilarity measure and non-parametric transforms with a support region such as rank and census <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> or normalized cross correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Using a combination of these two costs can significantly improve the result of stereo matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, for our fully connected model the cost with a support region is redundant because dissimilarity measure calculation in this case is similar to cost aggregation. Instead we use a linear combination u S p (l) of two per-pixel dissimilarities: u I p (l) -between left and right stereo images f lf , f rt and u G p (l) -between two corresponding gradient images g lf , g rt :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u S p (l) = u I p (l) + αu G p (l) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where α is an intrinsic parameter, which depends on the statistics of the data u I p (l) and u G p (l) (further explained in the Appendix).</p><p>Our choice is motivated by research papers in the optical flow area where such a combination demonstrates high robustness, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The gradient image in our paper is a six dimensional vector function defined in the same domain as the stereo image itself and this function is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g c,x (x, y) g c,y (x, y) = β 2 f c (x + 1, y) -f c (x -1, y) f c (x, y + 1) -f c (x, y -1) + β 4 1 1 -1 1 f c (x + 1, y + 1) -f c (x -1, y -1) f c (x + 1, y -1) -f c (x -1, y + 1) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where c ∈ {r, g, b}, (x, y) ≡ x, and the digital value of a normalization factor β must equalize the standard deviation of two signals f and g . The first term of sum in (3) is the conventional gradient operator and the second one is the same operator in the coordinate system rotated by π/2. Then we calculate the cost u I p (l) as truncated Birchfield-Tomasi dissimilarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> between stereo images:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u I p (l) = min min l-0.5≤d≤l+0.5 c∈C f lf c (x p ) -f rt c (x p -d) , τ I ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and the cost u G p (l) as truncated dissimilarity between gradient images:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">u G p (l) = min c∈C;x∈{x,y} g lf c,x (x p ) -g rt c,x (x p -l) , τ G ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where τ I and τ G are two truncation thresholds with values 90 and 180 respectively.</p><p>IV. STEREO MATCHING BY TWO-STEP ENERGY MINIMIZATION In this section we incorporate cost filtering into the energy minimization approach to stereo matching. First we show that under certain constraints cost filtering can be written as an energy minimization problem. After solving this energy minimization problem, we will use the computed marginal as the unary potential of a standard energy minimization problem. The objective is to benefit from the desired behavior of cost filtering approaches in the presence of occlusions. An overview of the method is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. MRF fully connected model</head><p>In the case of the fully connected MRF model each combination of pixels (p, q) of the image graph G belongs to the edge set E. And the binary potential for the model must be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">B p,q (l p , l q ) = ω (p, q) ϕ (l p , l q )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Where ϕ (•, •) is a pairwise penalty which enforces smoothness of the estimated disparity function, ω (p, q) is a pairwise weight which defines some reciprocal influence between every node and depends on the distance between pixels (p, q) in the bilateral color-image space. In this paper we consider the classical form, which is usually used in bilateral filtering for cost aggregation methods:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ω (p, q) = e - |xp-xq| 2 2σ 2 x - |fp-fq| 2 2σ 2 f<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Where x p is a coordinate of a pixel p, f p defines the image color vector value of the same pixel, σ x and σ f are intrinsic parameters of the bilateral kernel ω (p, q). The problem of energy minimization in (1) can be solved in the framework of belief propagation (BP) approach. The aim is to find marginal function ūp (•) and then estimate disparity in each pixel p by the simple winner take all (WTA) formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">l (x p ) = arg min l∈L ūp (l)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The core operation of BP is passing a message m p→q from node p to node q for the directed edge (p → q) ∈ E. The marginal function then is expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ūt p (l) = u p (l) + p,q∈E m t-1 p→q (l)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Here t is a number of the iteration, and it is supposed that the related iterative message passing procedure is given <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">m t p→q (i) = min j∈L ūt p (j) -m t-1 p→q (i) + B p,q (i, j) ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where indexes (i, j) ∈ L belong to the discrete disparity domain L.</p><p>For the first step of our optimization we consider only the marginal function which is obtained after one iteration of message passing. Thus, taking into account that m 0 p→q (l) ≡ 0 and ū0 p (l) ≡ u p (l) finally we rewrite <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">m p→q (i) = min j∈L (u p (j) + B p,q (i, j))<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Thus, to follow the BP paradigm for the fully connected model even with one message updating we can face intractable calculation problem: for the single vertex p it is necessary calculating numerous of messages by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Fortunately this problem can be simplified if we assume that the following constraints hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">u ∈ {0, 1} ϕ (i, j ∈ L) = 1 -δ (i, j) ω ≤ 1<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Where δ (i, j) is the Kronecker delta function. Which means that unary potential can be only unity or zero, smoothness potential ϕ is equivalent to Potts potential, bilateral weights less or equal to unity. Then <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> can be rewritten as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">m p→q (i) = ω (p, q) u p (i)<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Consequently, from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>) the marginal of the first message passing iteration is calculated:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ūp (l) = q∈V ω (p, q) u q (l)<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Thus the initial optimization problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is reformulated as the cost (unary potential) aggregation by the bilateral filtering in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. To perform the bilateral filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> in this paper we use the fast version proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. For this step of our algorithm the digital value of σ x and σ f in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>) are equal to 14 and 1.55 respectively. Increasing the number of iteration at this stage of optimization does not improve the final result, thus we take marginal as the unary potential for the next step of our optimization.</p><p>In the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> authors arrive to a similar transform by approximating the exact marginal distribution by the mean field and subsequently maximizing the energy exponent with KL-divergence. Here we show that there exists exact equivalence between message passing in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and the bilateral filter equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> under constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In addition, their model has not been applied to stereo matching.</p><p>To be consistent with the constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> we have to transform u S p (l) of Eq. 2 into a unary potential u p (l) by a step function with a threshold θ. However, a simple threshold transform into 0, 1 values is not robust and better to approximate the step function by error function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">u p (l) = 1 2 1 + erf ϑ u S p (l) -θ θ ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where ϑ and θ are two intrinsic parameters of the method (see Appendix). The transform in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> restricts the family of costs used in bilateral filtering of stereo matching. Fortunately, the proposed transform of the initial cost obtains better results when compared to generally used cost transforms, including the standard exponential cost and the untransformed cost form. We show this experimentally in Subsection VI A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. MRF locally connected model</head><p>For the second step of our global optimization the energy functional can be expressed as the follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Ē (l) = p∈V ūp (l p ) + p,q∈ Ē Bp,q (l p , l q ) (16)</formula><p>Where the unary potential is the output marginal obtained in the previous step of the optimization ūp (l p ), see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. The set of edges p, q ∈ Ē includes only local neighborhoods (in a four connected graph model). Bp,q (l p , l q ) is a binary potential, which enforces the local smoothness of the disparity map:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Bp,q (l p , l q ) = ω (p, q) φ (|l p -l q |)<label>(17)</label></formula><p>The energy minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> with such a functional is well researched in the stereo matching literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Usually the function φ (|l p -l q |) is considered as a truncated linear or quadratic dependency of |l p -l q | and the function ω (p, q) divides the set of edges into two or more subsets corresponding to a high or a low image gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We follow this paradigm and our binary potential consists of edge weights defined as a lookup table function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ω (p, q) =    λ 1 if |f (x p ) -f (x q )| &lt; µ 1 λ 2 if µ 1 ≤ |f (x p ) -f (x q )| &lt; µ 2 , λ 3 if |f (x p ) -f (x q )| ≥ µ 2<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">|f (x p ) -f (x q )| = c∈{r,g,b} |f c (x p ) -f c (x q )|</formula><p>The meaning of the weights in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">17</ref>) is similar to the function ω (p, q) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>): strong dependency between nodes when the colors are similar. In our experiments the constants in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> are chosen: λ 1 = 3.5, λ 2 = 0.6, λ 3 = 0.2, µ 1 = 7, µ 2 = 15. The smoothness multiplier in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> in our method is chosen as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">φ (|l p -l q |) =    0 if |l p -l q | = 0 β if |l p -l q | = 1 1 if |l p -l q | &gt; 1 (19)</formula><p>In stereo matching a nonzero value of |l p -l q | is usually considered as the discontinuity of the disparity map. However this is not true in general and a value 1 for |l p -l q | could be caused by discretization errors. Thus we choose the approximation to the truncated squared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> to stress the particularity of the value 1 and in our case the constant β is equal to 1  6 . In general, the energy minimization problem in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is an NP-hard problem, thus approximate minimization algorithms have to be chosen to solve the problem. To make our choice we follow the analysis given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and finally apply the TRW-S algorithm described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The TRW-S is the method, which was developed in the framework of the belief propagation paradigm. In the case of the functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> and the four connected neighborhood graph the iterative message passing procedure is given:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">m t p→q (i) = min j∈L 1 2 u t p (j) -m t-1 p→q (i) + Bp,q (i, j) ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where u t p (j) is the marginal function for this step of optimization, see calculation analogues in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</p><p>The sequential approach makes the TRW-S algorithm convergent and fast. For the truncated linear and quadratic priors the method usually reaches 0.3% approximation accuracy in a few iterations, thus outperforming the popular graph cut expansion algorithm both in accuracy and speed. The second order marginal u t p (j) uniquely defines the solution l (x) (disparity map) of the two-step global optimization with <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Thus this part of the method can be seen as a consecutive cost processing from u S to u as is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISPARITY MAP POST-PROCESSING</head><p>Post-processing steps are an integral part of stereo methods and indispensable for good results.

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> provides an overview of the usage of post-processing steps in the state-of-the art methods in stereo.

For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> authors make an iterative optimization over energy function, which strongly depends on of two disparity maps: initial-iterative firstly obtained by bilateral filtering approach and the same disparity map after plain fitting filter based on the mean shift segmentation. These methods are indicated from with a star in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. We will quantitatively analyze the impact of the post processing steps in our experiments.</p><p>We describe the post processing which we apply in this section. In our case post processing consists of a weighted median filtering a left-to-right disparity map cross-checking, outliers suppression, and a subpixel level correction. We follow recommendation from the papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, except for the subpixel level correction, where we apply a weighted median filter and Monte-Carlo strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Left-to-right disparity map cross-checking (LRC)</head><p>All left-right cross-checking algorithms are based on the assumption that the left disparity map l lf (x) is equal to the unwrapped right disparity map l rt (x), namely:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">l lf (x, y) = l rt x -l lf (x, y) , y<label>(21)</label></formula><p>Consequently, all pixels where this assumption does not hold are marked as uncertain. Usually, disparity estimation in uncertain pixels is not a trivial problem. We propose to simplify this procedure by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">l lf (x, y) = min l rt x -l lf (x, y) , y , l lf (x, y)<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Surprisingly, we found that this simple algorithm works better than the interpolation algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Weighted median filter</head><p>Weighted median filter usually is a robust extension of the bilateral filter and widely used in stereo matching postprocessing, for example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The main idea is to accumulate a weighted histogram in every pixel based on a previously estimated disparity map:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">h p (i) = q∈V e - |xp-xq| 2 2σ 2 x - |fp-fq| 2 2σ 2 f δ (l q , i) l q (23)</formula><p>Where l q is a disparity map obtained in the previous step, σx and σf are two intrinsic parameters of the weighted median filter. We take the digital value of σx equaling to 2, and the value of σf depends on a disparity map standard deviation that will be explained in the Appendix. Then the new value of the desired disparity map is estimated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">l p = arg med i∈L (h p (i))<label>(24)</label></formula><p>The two post-processing procedures: the left-to-right crosschecking and the weighted median filter in our method are implemented consecutively and twice. After which small area outlier suppression and subpixel correction are applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Small area outlier suppression</head><p>To detect outliers the input disparity map must be segmented. In other words, the set of vertex V of the four connected graph Ḡ = Ē, V is divided into k ∈ K subsets in such a way that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">k∈K V k = V; k∈K V k = ∅; (p, q) ∈ Ēk ⇒ |l p -l q | ≤ ∆ (25)</formula><p>This kind of segmentation can be achieved with strongly connected component analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The threshold ∆ usually is equal to 0, but we found that 1 produces more reasonable segmentation. Thus we use ∆ = 1 and mark all subsets, which satisfy the condition: |V k | &lt; 10 -3 |V| as the uncertain regions of the corrected disparity map. Next all the pixels in the uncertain regions (but only these pixels) are replaced by weighted median filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Note, that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> the weights which correspond to uncertain pixels are zero.</p><p>We found that the small area outlier suppression algorithm is less critical in terms of final accuracy. For example, for the Middlebury data set stereo images Tsukuba, Venus and Teddy the accuracy change is negligible. For the image Cones the disparity estimation accuracy slightly improves. However, the computational cost of this part of our method is insignificant and we included this in our full process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Subpixel accuracy correction</head><p>There are two kind of disparity subpixel enhancement methods:</p><p>1) Methods which interpolate the initial cost near the base disparity map by quadratic polynomial, and then to find a local minimum of the disparity in each pixel (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>); 2) Methods which extend the disparity (label) domain of the correlation volume by addition several intermediate disparity values divisible to 1/N (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>). The first approach is rather coarse and needs an additional filtering. The second, in general, increases the volume of data and the computation time of full method by N .</p><p>Here we propose a method, which is a tradeoff between the first and the second subpixel accuracy approach. The main idea is to disturb randomly the disparity map obtained on the previews step of our process by rational extension of the disparity domain according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">lp = l p + r p N , (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>where lp is the disturbed disparity map, N -a subpixel accuracy parameter, which is taken in our experiments as 4, r p ∈ {-N + 1, .., 0, .., N -1} some uniformly distributed random variable.</p><p>Then the weighted median filter is applied to the disturbed disparity to estimate the final disparity map:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">h p (i) = q∈V e - |xp-xq| 2 2σ 2 x - |lp-lq| 2 2σ 2 l - ũ( lp ) σu δ lq , i lq<label>(27)</label></formula><p>Where the weight term defines importance of this disparity value according to its cost: a low cost dissimilarity is more likely to be the true value of the chosen disparity. The parameters of the filter σx , σl and σu are equaling to 5.5, 0.9 and 16 respectively. The dissimilarity cost ũ lp is calculated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">ũ lp = c∈{r,g,b} f lf c (x p , y p ) -f rt c x p -lp , y p<label>(28)</label></formula><p>Note, the coordinate x p -lp is not integer, thus the value f rt x p -lp , y p in our method is the result of bicubic interpolation of the neighbor pixels.</p><p>The one pixel accuracy in stereo matching is the classic and the base criterion to compare the ability of the methods. The subpixel accuracy is not so important for many stereo vision applications e.g.: object recognition, intermediate view generation, scene segmentation and understanding. In our paper we do not aim to achieve competitive results in this category of the accuracy. The subpixel accuracy step is applied only because it can improve the result in the base category while being computationally cheap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section we evaluate our two-step global optimization approach on the Middlebury data set. We start by considering experiments with the different cost transforms and evaluating the advantage of incorporating cost filtering into the energy minimization approach to stereo matching. Next we will compare our results to other state-of-the-art methods and we analyze the impact of the post processing steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Cost transform analysis</head><p>Here we analyze the performance of the cost transform in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> and compare it to other generally used transforms. Usually, in stereo matching the cost can be applied directly in untransformed form (only simple truncation is applied), or with an exponential pre-transformation like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: u = 1 -exp (-ku s ) , where k is an intrinsic scale parameter. We compare these standard transforms to the proposed transform in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. The result of the experiments is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>. The first part of the table shows the impact of different cost transforms on the result of the two step energy minimization procedure. The second part represents the impact to the full procedure including post-processing. For the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> we also added an experiment which includes the bilateral kernel (for details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). However, we found that this decreased overall performance in our system.</p><p>Experiments in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref> show that the proposed transform considerably improves the performance of the algorithm when compared to the other transforms. To explain this result let us consider the MAP model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The general model supposes that a cost value is inversely propositional to the true solution probability. In fact this is not true. Clusters with small or great cost values have almost the same probability inside these clusters. Thus the distribution of costs is more like a Heaviside step function or even error function. As a result, the transform of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">15</ref>) which approximates a step-function, makes the new cost less sensitive to the energy regularization term. (This is achieved by increasing the number of cost values which most probably belong or not belong to the true solution). Consequently, the energy minimization procedure requires less regularization and avoids over-smoothing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. LCM and FCM analysis</head><p>To demonstrate advantage of the proposed combination of the LCM and FCM (without PPS) we compare the combined version with the results of the pure LCM the pure FCM. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref> we also refer the method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> from the Middlebury evaluation table that can be considered as analogues of the pure LCM algorithm and the algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> can be considered as analog of the pure FCM algorithm. Our results for the pure LCM the pure FCM are slightly better than the analogues in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, but it might be due to our robust cost calculation. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref> the bad pixels error is the percentage of disparity map pixels for which the absolute difference between the ground truth values is more than the error threshold. The base threshold of the Middlebury table is 1 and in our evaluation we hold to this criterion.</p><p>As an illustration of the advantage of incorporating cost filtering into the energy minimization we show the results for the pure LCM implementation and for the consecutive pure FCM plus pure LCM implementation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (a)-(b). We can see that the proposed combination compared with standard energy minimization approaches especially improves in the presence of occlusion: red bounding boxes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (a) focus on the false estimation regions in the presence of occlusion that are the result of the implementation of the pure LCM. Some of those outliers could be corrected with the post-processing steps, but in general better initial disparity maps result in better final result.</p><p>The FCM part of our algorithm performs better in the category all and the LCM part performs better in nonoccluded, which means that the FCM part of the algorithm is less sensitive to occlusion. This mentioned trend results in a significant performance gain in the final result. Thus in general our approach performs better in comparison with other methods in the presence of occlusion rather than in nonoccluded regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Overall results on Middlebury data set</head><p>Here we compare our method to state-of-the-art methods on the Middlebury data set. The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref> and the full version can be seen on the Middlebury evaluation website<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> . Our algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms listed on the Middlebury evaluation table on average rank with the base error threshold 1. We obtain the best reported results for Tsukuba and Cones, and similar to stateof-the-art on Venus. On the Teddy test stereo image our overall rank is 24. The main reason is the abrupt inclination of the scene plain at the bottom of the image plus rich texture in the same region. Here the main assumption that the nearest colors in a neighborhood belong to the same disparity is violated because rich texture adds ambiguities in the cost values domain.</p><p>To show the importance of the two-step optimization, we also evaluated the results when excluding either the fully connected model or the locally connected model. In both cases we apply post-processing. The results are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref>. You can see that in both cases results decrease significantly. Best results are obtained with the fully connected model. This shows that combining both models is important for accurate stereo matching.</p><p>Note, the evaluation in   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Analysis of postprocessing steps</head><p>Here we perform additional experiments to obtain a better understanding of the importance of the post-processing steps. We first run the system only based on the two-step global optimization approach. After which we add the post processing steps one-by-one. This allows us to show the contribution of the postprocessing steps. It should be noted that most state-ofthe-art methods make extensive use of post-processing. However, rarely the relative gain obtained by the post-processing part is explicitly analyzed.</p><p>The results of this experiment are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">V</ref>. One can see that the post-processing steps are crucial to obtain state-of-the-art results. Especially left-to-right cross-checking 2 http://www.cvc.uab.es/people/mozerov/Stereo/ and weighted median filter contribute significant to the overall accuracy. We found that small area outlier suppression is of less importance on this data set.</p><p>In addition, we provide visual comparison of these steps in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5 (a)-(e)</ref>, which confirms the importance of left-to-right cross-checking and weighted median filter post-processing steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Computational complexity analysis</head><p>The computational complexity of the method is O(N L).</p><p>Where N is the number of pixels in the image plain and L is the number of labels. The memory requirement is also proportional to the size of the correlation volume N L and for the Teddy data set the minimal required size of the used RAM is approximately 0.3GB for the float 4-byte calculation version and 0.5GB for the double 8-byte calculation version. The overall running time for the Teddy data set is 20 seconds and 3 seconds for the Tsukuba data set on a computer containing  an Intel Core i5-4300U 1.9-GHz CPU (using a single core only) and a 6-GB RAM. In principle, all components of the algorithm can be implemented in a parallel calculation scheme, but the bottleneck of the multiple core application is the TRW-S sequential message passing algorithm, which parallel processes are restricted by the number of strings or columns of the image grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The main contribution of the presented paper is the twostep global optimization. Its aim is to improve the robustness of energy minimization approach to stereo matching in the presence of occlusions. We do so by incorporating cost filtering, reformulated as a energy minimization problem on a fully connected MRF, into the global optimization. </p></div>
