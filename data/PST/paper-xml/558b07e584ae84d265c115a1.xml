Channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is obtained through limited (i.e., finite-bandwidth) feedback from the receivers that index a set of precoding vectors contained in a predefined codebook. We propose a novel transceiver architecture based on zero-forcing beamforming and linear receiver combining. The receiver combining and quantization for CSIT feedback are jointly designed in order to maximize the expected SINR for each user. We provide an analytic characterization of the achievable throughput in the case of many users and show how additional receive antennas or higher multiuser diversity can reduce the required feedback rate to achieve a target throughput. We also propose a design methodology for generating codebooks tailored for arbitrary spatial correlation statistics. The resulting codebooks have a tree structure that can be utilized in time-correlated MIMO channels to significantly reduce feedback overhead. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the overall transceiver design strategy and codebook design methodology compared to prior techniques in a variety of correlation environments.</p><p>Index Terms-Multiuser MIMO, channel state feedback, quantization, user selection, MMSE combiner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>M ULTIPLE antenna (MIMO) techniques are well known to improve the performance of a wireless link by creating multiple spatial channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In wireless communication systems, a typical scenario has multiple users vying for service from a single transmitter. These users could be served through time-multiplexing, but if multiple antennas are available at the transmitter, multiple users could be served more efficiently by transmitting to multiple users simultaneously over user-specific spatial channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This general technique, sometimes known as multiuser (MU) MIMO, is being considered for the downlink of next-generation mobile cellular systems to improve spectral efficiency.</p><p>MU-MIMO techniques require channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) in order to achieve spatial multiplexing across users. If CSIT is known ideally, an effective and relatively simple linear transmission technique is known as zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming where each user is served by a user-specific beam and receives no interference from the other Manuscript received November 2, 2007; revised April <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">2008</ref>. Matteo Trivellato is with the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova (e-mail: matteo.trivellato@dei.unipd.it).</p><p>Federico Boccardi and Howard Huang are with Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent (e-mail: {fb,hchuang}@alcatel-lucent.com).</p><p>Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/JSAC.2008.081015. users' beams <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. If users have multiple antennas, spatially multiplexed users could each receive spatially multiplexed data streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>The assumption of ideal CSIT may not be unreasonable under time-division duplexing (TDD) where the same band is used for the uplink and downlink. In this case, CSIT for the downlink can be obtained through channel estimation on the uplink. However ideal CSIT is not an appropriate assumption under frequency-division duplexing (FDD). In this case, the base station must rely on uplink feedback from the mobiles to obtain CSIT. In cellular systems, limited uplink bandwidth allows only a few bits of feedback during each interval, resulting in limited, nonideal CSIT. Furthermore, user mobility only makes the CSIT more unrealiable.</p><p>Typically, the feedback bits are used to index a set of vectors (or codewords) in a codebook C which is known to the transmitter and all receivers. For example, B bits per feedback interval can be used to index a codebook with 2 B vectors. For a transmitter with M antennas, each codeword in C is an Mdimensional vector that characterizes the MIMO channel for that user. A well-designed codebook will contain codewords that effectively span the set of MIMO channels experienced by the users. The beamforming function is derived from these vectors, for example, as a linear combination.</p><p>In this paper we propose a multiuser MIMO transceiver architecture and methodology under the assumption of limited CSIT, based on linear zero-forcing beamforming and linear receiver combining. This proposal is motivated by a downlink FDD cellular network where a base station equipped with M &gt; 1 antennas serves a large number (K &gt; M) of users, each equipped with N &gt; 1 antennas. The channel is first estimated by each user, and CSI feedback and the receiver combiner for each user are jointly computed to maximize a novel metric based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the combiner output. Because the actual SINR achieved during data transmission is a function of the beamforming weights, but because users cannot know the beamforming weights in advance, the metric is based on an expectation of the SINR. We call this combining strategy the maximum expected SINR combiner (MESC). Once the transmitter receives the CSI feedback from all K users, it determines the set of users to serve in order to maximize the weighted sum rate. During the data transmission, serviced users can demodulate the data using the previously derived MESC or using an enhanced combiner that requires knowledge 0733-8716/08/$25.00 c 2008 IEEE of the beamformed MIMO channel for maximizing the actual SINR. The proposed MESC is related to a previous ideal-CSIT technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and it is a generalization or extension of limited-CSIT techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> [11] <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>We provide an analytic characterization of the achievable throughput of the proposed combiner in the case of many users. Extending results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we show how additional receive antennas or higher multiuser diversity can reduce the required feedback rate to achieve a target throughput. We show how scaling the number of feedback bits linearly with the SNR expressed in dB we can assure a constant gap from the achievable sum rate with perfect CSIT. Furthermore this constant of proportionality linearly decreases with the number of receive antennas.</p><p>The performance of the proposed MU-MIMO architecture will depend on how well the quantized vectors in the codebook span the realizations of the MIMO channels. The problem of finding the optimal vector quantizer for a MU-MIMO system is not solved in general. In <ref type="bibr">[14] [15]</ref> the problem of maximizing the throughput of a MIMO single user system with limited feedback has been shown to be equivalent to the problem of packing one dimensional subspace known as Grassmannian line packing. This approach has been studied for MU-MIMO systems e.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Nevertheless, in our best knowledge, the optimality of Grassmannian packing has not been extend to the MU case. For spatially uncorrelated channels, random codebooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have been shown to perform well. Alternatively, other codebook designs have been proposed for highly correlated channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, but their performance is very low in the case of spatially uncorrelated channels.</p><p>We propose a more practical, higly adaptable technique for generating codebooks suited for any antenna configuration and level of spatial correlation. Codebook generation is based on the Lloyd-Max algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and extends the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for the case of multiple receiver antennas. In practice, codebook generation would be performed offline for a large variety of channel environments, and each user would measure the MIMO channel statistics and load an appropriate codebook from memory. Different codebooks can be loaded if the mobile moves to a different spatial environment, for example, from outdoors to indoors. Our proposed codebook design creates a nested structure that lends itself to hierarchical indexing. As a result, CSI feedback can be accumulated over multiple signaling intervals in order to index a much larger codebook which results in improved performance for low mobility users <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. We show an example of a simple hierarchical feedback strategy.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the system model. Section III describes the MESC receiver technique under limited feedback and Section IV provides an asymptotic performance analysis of the proposed combiner in case of many users. Section V describes the codebook design technique, and numerical results are presented in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>We consider a narrowband multiantenna downlink channel modeled as a MIMO-BC with flat fading, where K users, each equipped with N receive antennas, request service from the transmitter which has M antennas. The discrete-time complex baseband received signal by the kth user is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y k = H k x + n k , k = 1, . . . , K<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where H k ∈ C N ×M is the kth user's channel matrix, x ∈ C M×1 is the transmitted signal vector, and n k ∼ CN (0, 1) is the complex additive white Gaussian noise at the kth user. Each user is assumed to have ideal knowledge of its channel.</p><p>If N &gt; 1, users could each receive multiple spatial data streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, in this paper we transmit at most a single stream to an active user. In systems where K M (as in the practical cellular systems we consider), this restriction is justified through analytic <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and empirical <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> observations under ideal CSIT. And similar observations were made in the case of limited CSIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Furthermore, limiting the transmission to a single stream results in less uplink feedback per user, providing additional justification for the restriction.</p><p>On a given symbol period, the base serves a subset of users S ⊆ {1, . . . , K}. We assume a linear precoder (beamformer) based on zero-forcing which we discuss later. Because of the transmitter's limited degrees of freedom, the number of active users is restricted: |S| ≤ M . The transmitted signal can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x = |S| k=1 g k d k ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where g k ∈ C M×1 is the precoding vector for user k and d k is the kth-user information symbol. Under an average sum-power constraint the transmitted signal must satisfy E tr{xx H } ≤ P .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE MAXIMUM ESTIMATED SINR COMBINER (MESC) TECHNIQUE</head><p>In this section we describe our proposed transceiver architecture in three phases. In the first phase, each of the K receivers measures its MIMO channel and feeds back information about the channel to the transmitter. In the second phase, the transmitter uses the CQI and CDI information from all receivers to determine the set of active users S and the precoding vectors g k , k ∈ S for each data stream. In the third phase, each user in S demodulates the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Phase I: Determining feedback sent from receivers</head><p>Each receiver estimates its MIMO channel based on pilot signals transmitted on each of the M antennas and feeds back two types of information to the transmitter: a channel quality indicator (CQI) and a channel direction information (CDI). The CQI is an estimate of the user's achievable rate, or equivalently its SINR, and the CDI describes the orientation of the channel. The CDI feedback consists of B bits which are sent to the transmitter on an uplink control channel. These bits are an index into a codebook C that consists of 2 B Mdimensional codeword vectors with unit norm. The kth user's CDI vector vk ∈ C can be interpreted as a normalized, quantized version of its MISO channel at the output of a receiver combiner. In phase 2, the transmitter determines the transmit beamforming weights for a set of served users S as a function of the users' CDI vectors vk , k = 1, . . . , K. The actual achievable rate of a served user in phase 3 is a function of its MIMO channel, the transmit beamforming weights, the residual interbeam interference, and the receiver combining. During phase 1, a user does not have a priori knowledge of the CDI vectors for the other users in S, and hence it cannot know what the beamforming weights or interference will be. We therefore propose to use the expected SINR as the CQI by making a judicious prediction on the interference statistics. This quantity denoted with γ k is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The receiver combiner and CDI vector which maximize the expected SINR are jointly determined according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>In cellular standards, the quantization of CQI feedback uses a large number of bits in order to closely match the channel quality with a fine granularity of modulation and coding options. We use this observation to justify our assumption that the CQI is an unquantized analog value. This is a typical assumption found in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Both the analog CQI and B CDI bits are assumed to be fed back to the transmitter with no errors or delay.</p><p>We suppose that the transmitter serves a set of users in set S. The kth receiver (k ∈ S) processes the received signal using a linear combiner given by a unit-norm N -dimensional vector u k . The signal at the combiner output is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r k = u H k y k = u H k H k g k d k + u H k H k i∈S,i =k g i d i + n k (3)</formula><p>where y k is the received signal given by (1), n k is the unit variance complex Gaussian processed noise, and g i is the M × 1 precoding vector for the ith selected user. The SINR for the kth user is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">SINR k = p k |u H k H k w k | 2 1 + i∈S\{k} p i |u H k H k w i | 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where g k = √ p k w k is the beamforming vector for user k and w k is the ZF precoder to be defined in Section III-B. We consider an average sum-power constraint and impose equal power-allocation for the selected users, i.e. p k = P |S|||w k ||<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . This last restriction is sub-optimum but allows to derive a good approximation of the expected SINR of each user that otherwise would be difficult to predict. We emphasize that the analysis developed in this section is based on the following assumptions: 1) Rayleigh fading channels with i.i.d. elements ∼ CN(0, 1) 2) quantization error vector isotropically distributed in the hyperspace orthogonal to the selected codeword 3) independent codebooks for different users. As a consequence it strictly holds for RVQ but it also provides a good approximation in case of well-designed codebooks with large B.</p><p>We define v k = H H k u k to be the equivalent MISO channel for the kth user and define the CDI vector vk as its unitnorm, quantized version. We also define the quantization error as <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">e H k = v H k -(v H k vk )v H k , with square norm ||e H k || 2 = ||u H k H k -(u H k H k vk )v H k ||. Let us introduce the unit-norm vectors ẽk = e k /||e k || and wk = w k /||w k ||. Then, by decomposing v k as v k = (v H k v k )v k +e k , (</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">SINR k = P |S| (v H k vk )(v H k wk ) + e H k wk 2 1 + P |S| ||e H k || 2 i∈S\{k} |ẽ H k wi | 2<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Let us focus on the term at the numerator. Say φ k ∈ [0, π/2] the angle between vectors vk and wk , which is in general non-zero<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , then by construction of the ZF beamformer</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">cos φ k = |v H k wk | = 1 ||w k || . (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>Moreover, if φ k is small enough, i.e. the users selected for transmissions have nearly orthogonal reported channels, the k-th error vector is almost orthogonal to the k-th beamforming vector such that we have the approximation 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">e H k wk ≈ 0 . (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>We now focus on the sum at the denominator of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>). The unit vectors ẽk and wi are isotropically distributed on the (M -1)-dimensional hyperplane orthogonal to vk . Moreover, as the directional distribution of wi on this hyperplane depends only on vj for j ∈ S \ {k, i}, it follows that wi is independent of the quantization error ẽk , for any i = k. Hence, the inner product |ẽ H k wi | is Beta-distributed with parameters (1, M -1), with mean value 1/(M -1). By taking the expectation of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) with respect to the interference term and noticing that the SINR function is monotonic with this term, Jensen's inequality yields the following lower-bound</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E [SINR k ] ≥ P |S| (v H k vk )(v H k wk ) + e H k wk 2 1 + P |S| ||e H k || 2 E i∈S\{k} |ẽ H k wi | 2 = P |S| (v H k vk )(v H k wk ) + e H k wk 2 1 + P |S| ||e H k || 2 |S|-1 M-1 ≈ p k |u H k H k vk | 2 1 + P |S| |S|-1 M-1 ||u H k H k -(u H k H k vk )v H k || 2 .

It is straightforward to show that <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> represents the exact SINR of the kth receiver when the CDIs of the selected users form a set of M orthogonal vectors.

The maximizing arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> can be determined in a straightforward manner by considering all codewords c i ∈ C. For a given codeword c i , the desired detector is the MMSE linear combiner which can be derived as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">u k = (I + B k ) -1 √ ρ H k c i , (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>normalized to unit norm.

Hence the proposed MESC reduces to choosing the codeword closest in direction to the dominant right singular vector of the channel matrix at low SNR and asymptotic high B.</p><p>For another special case of high SNR, thermal noise becomes negligible with respect to multiuser interference, and (10) reduces to</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">High SNR γ k = |ṽ H k vk | 2 1 -|ṽ H k vk | 2 = cos 2 (Θ k ) sin 2 (Θ k )<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where Θ k = ∠(ṽ k , vk ) and the expected SINR is maximized minimizing the angle Θ k between the normalized equivalent channel ṽk and the quantization vector vk . In other words the quantization vector is chosen as the codeword at minimum chordal distance from the space spanned by the rows of the channel matrix H k completely neglecting the gain associated to the equivalent channel. This corresponds to the quantization-based combing (QBC) solution proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> .</p><p>This analysis reveals how the proposed MESC, according to the receiver SNR and the number of feedback bits B, chooses the combining vector and the codeword that give the best trade-off between quantization accuracy (minimization of Θ k ) and gain of the equivalent channel (||v k ||) in order to maximize the expected SINR. For low SNR and high B, this corresponds to choosing the equivalent channel with the largest gain. Whereas at high SNR, quantization accuracy becomes the dominant factor.</p></div>

Phase II: User selection and precoder determination at the transmitter</head><p>Using CDI vector and CQI feedback from all of the mobiles, the base station chooses a set S of users to serve based on a weighted sum rate given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">R (S) = k∈S α k log 2 (1 + γk )<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where α k is the quality of service weight for the kth user and the CQI γk is given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">9</ref>). For a given set S, we collect the CDI vectors of these users in Λ(S) = [v 1 , . . . , v|S| ] H , and we define the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">W(S) = [w 1 , . . . , w |S| ] = Λ(S) † = Λ(S) H Λ(S)Λ(S) H -1 .

In GUS at iteration i a new user is added only if the estimated achievable weighted sum rate ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">19</ref>) is increased with respect to iteration i -1. Moreover using CDIs it is possible to improve the estimation of the achievable SINR for the set of selected users at each iteration.</p><p>In contrast, SUS has a double selection procedure. First there is a selection among the available users of the ones semi-orthogonal to the users already selected, i.e. users whose channel has a correlation smaller than with already selected users. This gives a set A (i) with A (0) = K. Then the user with highest CQI in A (i) is selected for transmission.</p><p>SUS is more amenable for analysis, and we use it Section IV. Because of the relative simplicity of GUS, it would be easier to use in practice, and we use it in Section VI for the numerical simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Phase III: Data demodulation at the active receivers</head><p>In order for users in the active set S to perform coherent data demodulation, they need coherent channel estimates of the beamformed SIMO channel. An estimate can be obtained from pilot sequences, sometimes known as dedicated pilots, for each receiver modulated using its designated beamforming vector. Data demodulation can be performed using the MESC u k from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Alternatively, as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, each user could estimate the equivalent channels with respect to the precoded streams destined for other users and derive the MMSE detector explicitly for the desired signal in the presence of this interference. Let f (j) k = H k g j , in case of perfect channel estimation, the new MMSE combiner for user k is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">u k = ⎛ ⎝ I + j∈S,j =k f (j) k f (j) H k ⎞ ⎠ -1 f (k) k , (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>normalized to have unit norm.

Because we are interested in a cellular downlink context, we study the case of many users K M and fewer receive antennas than transmit antennas N &lt; M. We assume each user channel matrix H k has i.i.d complex zero-mean Gaussian entries with unit variance. Moreover to simplify analysis we assume that users with orthogonal CDIs are selected at transmitter and that (10) represents the effective SINR for user k. Under these assumptions and adopting MESC, the achievable SINR γ k,i of user k for a generic codeword c i is given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">16</ref>) which can also be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> γ k,i = 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">I + G H H H k H k G -1 k,k -1<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where G is the unitary beamformer and g k = c i is the precoding vector for user k.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Alternative tree structure of the LBG-based codebook and hierarchical feedback</head><p>If the MIMO channel is changing sufficiently slowly, the mobile CDI feedback could be aggregated over multiple feedback intervals so that the aggregated bits index a larger codebook. In general, a larger codebook implies more accurate knowledge of the MIMO channel at the transmitter, resulting in improved throughput. By aggregating the feedback bits over multiple intervals, the codewords can be arranged in a hierarchical tree structure so that the feedback on a given interval is an index of codewords that are the "children nodes" of a codeword indexed by previous feedback.</p><p>The LBG algorithm can be modified to generate a codebook with this type of tree structure using the following steps:</p><p>1) At level L = log 2 M we consider a codebook composed by M orthogonal unit norm vectors. We consider the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix which is an optimum codebook for this level both for an i.i.d and line-of-sight (LOS) channel. 2) We compute the partition regions relative to each codeword and we obtain L subsets of the TS. 3) For level L + 1, L + 2, . . . we compute the optimum codebook with 2 vectors for each subset using the LBG algorithm and split each subset into 2 subsets. This binary construction procedure can be represented by a binary tree of B max levels (B max denotes the maximum number of quantization bits), having at level i the codewords of the codebook with 2 i elements.</p><p>With the designed codebook, quantization can be performed with a binary search on the tree, thus requiring a lower computation complexity than conventional quantization, at the expense of a larger memory and a little decrease in quantization performance compared to a ML brute force search.</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for the case of B max = 6, a binary representation (codeword) of each precoding vector is obtained by associating a bit to each of the two branches exiting a node and identifying a node at level i with the i bits on the branches leading from the root to the node itself. As a consequence, all nodes of the subtree departing from a node at level i have the same i most significant bits. The codeword of i + 1 bits associated to a given channel realization can be obtained by adding one bit to the representation with i bits.</p><p>Moreover, slight changes of the channel in subsequent time slots most probably lead to codewords with the same most significant bits. To reduce feedback overhead in time correlated MIMO channels, instead of feeding back the most significant B bits in each coherence interval (referred as Basic Feedback (BFB)), we use the available feedback bits to update the previous channel vector.</p><p>We assume that at slot n -1, both BS and MT k share the reproduced vector state vk (n -1), represented by a binary word of variable length L s (n -1). At slot n, MT k using a tree search chooses the best codeword vk (n) of B max bits for the current channel realization H k (n) and compares the first L s (n -1) bits of the binary representations of vk (n) and vk (n -1). The comparison leads to two cases, corresponding to a match (Down case) or no match (Up Case) between the two sequences. Let i k (n) be the binary word of B bits fed back by MT k at time slot n. The first bit i k,1 (n) denotes the Up or Down case. The following bits are determined as follows:</p><p>• Down Case. The CSIT is refined by feeding back further B -1 bits of the B max -bits codeword. These additional bits are obtained by going down by B -1 levels into the quantization tree. This is performed by feeding back bits at position L s (n -1) + 1, . . . , L s (n -1) + B -1 of the codeword associated to vk (n). Moreover, L s (n) = L s (n -1) + B -1. • Up Case. The CSIT must be updated and the B -1 bits L s (n -1) -2(B -1) + 1, . . . , L s (n -1) -B + 1 of the B max bit codeword associated to vk (n) are fed back to BS. Now, L s (n) = L s (n -1) -B + 1. The proposed algorithm (referred as Hierarchical Feedback (HFB)) can be easily generalized to account for boundary conditions imposing that B -1 ≤ L s (n) ≤ B max . Thanks to this simple strategy we are able to track channel variations at the cost of an overhead of only one flag bit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>We consider a transmitter with M = 4 antennas and for the purpose of this first comparison we consider a Rayleigh fading channel model with i.i.d elements ∼ CN (0, 1). We adopt the proposed MESC, a simple RVQ and the SUS algorithm with correlation parameter = 0.3. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> we show how scaling the number of feedback bits B according to (30) with c = 9, K = 256 and N = 3 can assure a constant gap in terms of sum rate from the curve of perfect CSIT. Differently using the same amount of feedback bits in a system with N = 2 or N = 1 is not enough to keep a constant gap from the upper bound. This could be achieved only using N = 2 or N = 1 in (30) and scaling B accordingly. Moreover we show how quantities 2 B and K are interchangeable. Indeed setting B = 6 and scaling K according to (30) for N = 3 still provides almost a constant gap from ZF with perfect CSIT.</p><p>In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> we compare the achievable sum rate of MESC, MRC and QBC proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> as a function of  SNR, for K = 20 users, B = 4 feedback bits and N = 2, 4 receive antennas. We still use an i.i.d. channel model and RVQ but adopt the GUS algorithm because as verified by simulations and shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> it generally provides higher performance than SUS and is more practical, not requiring the optimization of the correlation parameter . As an upper bound under perfect CSIT, we show the performance of the MET <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> by restricting transmission of active users to only the dominant eigenmode and considering optimal waterfilling power allocation (we refer to this structure as MET-1). The proposed MESC generally outperforms the other two schemes in all the SNR region with MRC approaching the proposed solution in the low SNR while QBC in the high SNR region. We notice that the gap between MESC and QBC is very small for N = 2 but strongly increases with more receive antennas. Moreover with N = 2 and fixed B,K the system becomes interference limited at high SNR as suggested by (32). It is also interesting to observe that designing in the second phase a new MMSE combiner for the selected users does not provide    significant gain for QBC and the proposed solution. Indeed, the combiner designed in the first phase for the kth selected user would represent the MMSE combiner if the CDI of the selected users were orthogonal. As long as the number of users in the system is much greater than the number of transmit antennas, the user selection algorithm used at the transmitter tries to select almost orthogonal users so that the combiner designed in the first phase becomes a close approximation of the MMSE combiner for the set of selected users.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> using the proposed MESC we compare the performance achievable with RVQ and the new LBG-based codebooks designed for both low (LBG-L) and high (LBG-H) SNR regimes. The transmitter is still equipped with M = 4 antennas, K = 20 users are present in the system with N = 2 antennas each and B = 3 bits are fed back by each receiver. We analyze three different channel models: the i.i.d Rayleigh fading and two spatially correlated channel models. For these last two models the transmit antennas are spaced by Δ T X = 10 and 2 λ, respectively, where λ = c/f c is the wavelength, c = 3 × 10 8 m/s is the speed of light and f c = 2 GHz is the carrier frequency. The channel is modelled as timevariant, flat Rayleigh fading, according to the spatial channel model (SCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The time slot duration is T = 0.5 ms and the receive antennas of each mobile are spaced Δ RX = 0.5 λ.</p><p>First we observe the LBG codebooks outperform RVQ both for independent and spatially correlated channels. Increasing the transmit antenna correlation generally reduces the spatial diversity of the system. Nevertheless, by exploiting multiuser diversity and matching the codebook design to the spatial correlation, the proposed transmission scheme provides better performance as the transmit antenna correlation increases. Interestingly the performance metric used in the design of the LBG codebook does not affect significantly system performance, anyway using LBG-L is preferable in the low SNR regime while LBG-H provides better performance for higher SNR.</p><p>The beneficial effect of transmit antenna correlation for the proposed ZF-based transmission schemes is also emphasized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. In the cases of both perfect and limited channel state information at the transmitter, increasing transmit antenna correlation provides performance improvement when multiuser diversity is available. Especially under limited feedback from receivers, transmit antenna correlation reduces the dimension of the hyperspace to quantize and for a given number of bits the resulting codebook better characterizes the space of the MIMO channel realizations. Hence even if higher transmit antenna correlation implies less spatial diversity, the higher quantization accuracy and the possibility of exploiting multiuser diversity provides significant performance improvement over uncorrelated channels.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> we still compare RVQ with LBG-L for increasing number of feedback bits B. Still the SCM is utilized with M = 4 transmit antennas and N = 2, 4 receive antennas spaced respectively by Δ T X = 10 λ and Δ RX = 0.5 λ at the carrier frequency f c = 2 GHz. We fix an average SN R = 10 dB and compare the achievable sum rate performance. As an upper bound we also include MET-1 with perfect CSIT. We observe as the LBG-based codebook is able to exploit  the spatial correlation of the MIMO channel providing higher performance than RVQ and maintaining a performance gap even when the number of feedback bits B increases and both schemes approach the upper bound provided by MET-1 with perfect CSIT. Furthermore Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> emphasizes as for a given number of feedback bits the additional degrees of freedom provided by more receive antenna can be exploited using MESC and the LBG-L codebook to increase the achievable throughput. Interestingly the proposed solution for B = log 2 M is equivalent to the technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that uses unitary precoding. Indeed for both schemes the codebook is a unitary matrix and the combiner is computed as the MMSE combiner assuming the CDIs of the selected users form a set of M orthogonal vectors.</p><p>Finally in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> we show the performance impact of exploiting time correlation for LBG codebooks designed with a hierarchical structure. A codebook is designed with a depth of B max = 12 levels and is indexed using B = 3 bits per interval. We compare the proposed solution using the  MESC and a hierarchical LBG codebook with the hierarchical DFT codebook based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Since the channel is lightly correlated the performance of hierarchical DFT is poor while the proposed LBG codebooks used jointly with the hierarchical feedback (HFB) provides significant gain with respect to the basic feedback strategy (BFB), even as the speed of the mobiles increases. Still we notice that LBG-H is preferable at high SNR. We observe that the hierarchical approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> results in a degradation of system performance. This is mainly due to the tree search applied with the new CDI quantization strategy that does not guarantee a ML quantization as a brute force approach would do. Indeed since the DFT codebook does not effectively characterize the channel statistics, even increasing its effective size using the hierarchical feedback does not provide a sufficient gain in quantization accuracy to compensate the loss due to the suboptimum tree search.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We propose a new multiuser MIMO transceiver scheme for the downlink of next-generation wireless systems under limited uplink feedback. In contrast to most schemes present in literature, the proposal applies to mobile terminals possibly equipped with multiple antennas. These provide additional degrees of freedom that are exploited to enhance the achievable throughput for a given feedback rate. Using a zero forcingtype of beamformer and allocating at most one stream for each selected user, the proposal jointly designs the receive combiner at each mobile and the feedback information in order to maximize the expected achievable SINR. For this proposal, known as the maximum expected SINR combiner (MESC), we provide an analytic characterization of the achievable throughput in the case of many users and show how additional receive antennas or higher multiuser diversity can reduce the required feedback rate to achieve a target throughput. Simulations results show that MESC generally outperforms other schemes known in literature.</p><p>A second contribution addresses the problem of codebook design and feedback signalling for multiuser MIMO systems. A generalized Lloyd-Max algorithm for multiple receive antenna terminals is applied with two different performance metrics corresponding to the low and high SNR regimes. The proposed approach exploits spatial correlation between transmit and receive antennas, showing how antenna correlation in conjunction with multiuser diversity can provide performance improvement over correlated channels in multiuser MIMO systems with limited feedback. Moreover the codebook can be designed using a hierarchical tree structure, providing an efficient way to enhance system throughput for a given level of feedback in systems with low-speed mobile terminals.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Nevertheless, to maximize the achievable throughput, the user selection algorithm tries to select users with almost orthogonal CDIs and (7) generally holds.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="foot_2"><p>We emphasize that if M = N the channel vectors span C M with probability one. Therefore each quantization vector has zero angle with the channel subspace and when using QBC there is no gain in increasing the feedback rate. Differently MESC accounts for the norm of the equivalent channel and even with N ≥ M is able to exploit additional feedback bits and provides significant gain over QBC as shown in Section VI.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4" xml:id="foot_3"><p>The size of TS has to scale at least linearly with the number of desired codewords to achieve good performance<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, hence the complexity of codebook design scales at least exponentially with the number of feedback bits. Nevertheless codebook generation can be performed off-line, and codebooks can be uploaded from the base station. Therefore the complexity of the algorithm is not an issue.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5" xml:id="foot_4"><p><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> We recall that the LBG algorithm converges to a maximum that is not guaranteed to be global, nevertheless it provides a practical way for codebook design even when the PDF of the source signal is not known or difficult to characterize.</p></note>
