<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Integrating mobile edge computing (MEC) into the Internet of Things (IoT) enables the IoT devices of limited computation capabilities and energy to offload their computationintensive and delay-sensitive tasks to the network edge, thereby providing high quality of service to the devices.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Massive Internet of Things (mIoT) is an essential component of future wireless networks, which has been envisioned to interconnect massive number of devices from various environments and support many novel applications. Traditionally, the IoT applications are operated in a centralized manner. That is, the IoT devices send their data to a remote cloud for further computing and processing. However, according to Cisco's report <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the global machine-type data traffic will reach 25 exabytes per month by 2022, which is a sevenfold increase over 2017. This huge amount of data traffic will introduce significant load to the already-congested backbone networks, making it increasingly impractical to utilize the remote cloud alone to process the ever growing distributed data. Against this backdrop, mobile edge computing (MEC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which deploys computing functionalities and storage resources at the network edge, e.g., small-cell base stations (SBSs), has been recognized as a promising solution to relieve the backhaul load, reduce the latency, and provide fast-response data processing services for users.</p><p>Another key feature of mIoT is high connection density. It has been predicted that the number of the IoT devices will reach 20.8 billion by 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which poses great challenges for the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme to fulfill the high connection density requirement. To address this issue, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> has been proposed as an alternative for traditional OMA, due to the fact that it can achieve massive connections, improve the spectrum efficiency, and reduce the delay. The key idea of NOMA is to allow multiple users to transmit on the same resource block simultaneously, and successive interference cancelation (SIC) is used as an efficient multi-user detection technique at the receiver to reduce the co-channel interference and decode the target signal.</p><p>Motivated by the benefits of MEC and NOMA, increasing research attention has been paid to integrate MEC and NOMA into wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Specifically, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed heuristic algorithms for MEC-aware NOMA single cell, in which the user clustering, computation resource and transmission powers allocation were jointly optimized to minimize the energy consumption. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the authors proposed a joint optimization scheme of SIC ordering and computation resource in a MEC-aware NOMA NB-IoT network, in order to minimize the total execution delay for each bit. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> considered two kinds of users scenarios, including the single user and the multiple users, in which the offloading workloads and transmission time were both optimized to minimize the delay, while satisfying the computation requirement of each user. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the authors proposed a scheduling-based algorithm for the device-todevice (D2D)-assisted and NOMA-based MEC system, in which D2D was applied to enhance the user collaboration and relieve the computing burden on edge server, and the computation resource, power, and channel allocations were jointly optimized to minimize the system cost.</p><p>The aforementioned works <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> focused on the singlecell networks. Recently, the more general and compelling problem of NOMA-assisted MEC in multi-cell networks has been attracting increasing research attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Specifically, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> investigated the joint power and computation resource allocation allocation scheme for the NOMA-</p><p>• We propose an energy-efficient NOMA-based MEC design for multi-cell network with mIoT devices. In this design, we formulate a joint communication and computation resource allocation problem in order to maximize the energy efficiency for offloading, while ensuring successful task execution at each device within their tolerable computation delay. • We decouple the non-convex energy efficiency maximization problem into two separated subproblems, i.e., the communication resource allocation and the computation resource allocation problems, and show how the energy efficiency can be maximized by solving these problems iteratively.</p><p>Beyond the above contributions, the results presented in our work provide the insights into the design of novel schemes for multi-cell networks that simultaneously enable massive access and energy-efficient MEC. Specifically, we examine the impacts of system parameters, such as the number of users accessing the same subchannel, the number of computing RBs, the workload of users, and the tolerable delay for offloading on the energy efficiency of our proposed design, showing how the maximum energy efficiency can be achieved by judiciously matching the communication resources with the computation resources.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system model is presented and the problem is formulated. Section III develops the joint radio and computation resource allocation scheme. Section IV presents the simulation results. Finally, section V draws the conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), we consider mobile edge computing in a multi-cell network with N single-antenna SBSs and U single-antenna IoT devices (e.g., sensors and meters), indexed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N = {1, 2, • • • , N } and U = {1, 2, • • • , U }, respectively. The total system bandwidth, B, is equally divided into M orthogonal subchannels, indexed by M = {1, 2, • • • , M }.</formula><p>We consider the use of the nearest BS association policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. As such, each IoT device associates with the nearest SBS that can provide the maximum average channel gain. We denote the set of devices served by SBS n as U n . Considering the limited computing capabilities and energy storage of IoT devices, the sensed data needs to be offloaded to the MEC server for processing to get some useful information, e.g., the further instruction for IoT devices and the feedback for subscribed users. Therefore, each device u ∈ U offloads its computation tasks to its associated SBS n ∈ N via subchannel m ∈ M. We assume that M &lt; N . As such, the devices associated with different SBSs may access to the same subchannel and interfere with each other. We denote the set of devices served by SBS n on subchannel m as U m n .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Communication and Energy Consumption</head><p>The IoT devices served by the same SBS n on the same subchannel m form a NOMA cluster U m n , where NOMA protocol is adopted to perform the task offloading. Let N m n and h m n,u denote the number of devices in U m n and the channel coefficient of the link from device u to SBS n on subchannel m, respectively. Without loss of generality, we assume that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h m n,1 2 &gt; h m n,2 2 &gt; ... &gt; h m n,u 2 &gt; ... &gt; h m n,N m n 2</formula><p>. In addition, we use a parameter tuple (L n,u , S n,u , D n,u ) to model the computation task of device u served by SBS n (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>), where L n,u is the data size of the task, S n,u is the required CPU cycles for computing one bit of the task and D n,u is the tolerable delay.</p><p>As per the rules of NOMA protocol, the SBSs apply SIC for multi-user detection 1 . Specifically, each SBS n sequentially decodes the signal from devices with higher channel gains and regards all the other signals as the interference. As such, the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of SBS n for device u ∈ U m n is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">γ m n,u = p m n,u h m n,u 2 N m n ∑ v=u+1 p m n,v h m n,v<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">Intra-cell interference + N ∑ l=1,l̸ =n N m l ∑ t=1 p m l,t g m l,t,n 2 Inter-cell interference +σ 2 , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">) where p m n,u is the transmission power of device u ∈ U m n , g m l,t,n</formula><p>is the channel coefficient of the interference link from device t served by SBS l to SBS n on the same subchannel m, and the first and second part in the denominator represent intra-cell and inter-cell interference, respectively. Based on (1), the transmission rate of device u ∈ U m n can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R m n,u = β m n,u B M log 2 ( 1 + γ m n,u ) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where β m n,u represents the subchannel allocation variable. Specifically, β m n,u = 1 means that subchannel m is allocated to device u. Otherwise, β m n,u = 0. Then, the power consumption of all devices are expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">U P = P C +P T = P C + ∑ M m=1 ∑ N n=1 ∑ N m n u=1 β m n,u p m n,u ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where P C and P T are the circuit power consumption and transmission power consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> of the massive IoT system, respectively, and ∑ M m=1 β m n,u p m n,u is the transmission power consumed by each device u ∈ U m n . According to (2) and (3), the energy efficiency of the considered system is obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">η = ∑ M m=1 ∑ N n=1 ∑ N m n u=1 R m n,u U P = U R U P . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Computation and Delay Constraints</head><p>We now describe the computation model considered in this paper. Specifically, we consider that the maximum tolerable delay for IoT device u ∈ U n is D n,u . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>, it consists of the offloading delay T n,u , the computation delay C n,u , and the transmission delay that feeds the computation results back to device u, K n,u . Compared to T n,u and C n,u , the value of K n,u is rather small and therefore can be ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. As such, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T n,u + C n,u ≤ D n,u ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">T n,u = L n,u R n,u ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>1 Since the inter-cell interference experienced by NOMA devices on the same subchannel when offloading their tasks in the uplink is identical, the decoding order is only determined by the decreasing order of the channel gains.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">C n,u = L n,u S n,u y n,u ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where y n,u is the computing resource blocks (RBs) allocated to device u served by SBS n. We assume that each SBS n ∈ N has a computation capacity, CB n , and therefore the total computing RBs allocated to the devices served by SBS n is limited, i.e., ∑ Un u=1 y n,u ≤ CB n . Based on (5), we note that, since C n,u &lt; D n,u , the following inequality can be obtained, R n,u ≥ R min n,u , where R min n,u = Ln,u Dn,u-Cn,u .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Problem Formulation</head><p>The key of this work is to maximize the energy efficiency for offloading in multi-cell networks with massive IoT devices by optimizing the subchannel allocation scheme β * , the uplink transmission power allocation scheme p * , and the computation resource allocation scheme y * . Mathematically, it can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P1 : max β,p,y η s.t.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. JOINT RADIO AND COMPUTATION RESOURCE ALLOCATION</head><p>To solve the problem P1, in this section, we propose a joint radio and computation resource allocation scheme. Note that P1 is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem due to the binary, integer, and real variables β m n,u , y n,u , p m n,u . Thus, P1 is in general intractable. To make progress, we propose a two-phase joint radio and computation resource allocation scheme. The overall algorithm flowchart of the proposed scheme is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> at the top of the next page. The whole procedure consists of two phases. In the 0733-8716 (c) 2020 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. first phase, the radio resource allocation P2 is performed for a fixed computation resource allocation. In the second phase, the computation resource allocation P3 is performed. Note that these two phases are performed iteratively until the maximum energy efficiency is achieved. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the red point I1 is the initial point of the whole procedure. The blue points T21 and T22 are the termination points of P2, and the blue point T3 is the termination point of P3, respectively. Specifically, we decouple P1 into P2 and P3, respectively, given by P2 : max </p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P3 : max yn,u η s.t. y n,u ≥ Ln,uSn,u Dn,u- Ln,u Rn,u , ∀n, ∀u ∈ U n (8b) and (8f ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where P2 is the radio resource allocation problem and P3 is the computation resource allocation problem. In addition, we note that the first constraint in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) is a transformation of (8a). In the following, we examine the solutions of P2 and P3, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Joint Radio Resource Allocation Problem</head><p>The radio resource allocation problem P2 is still a nonconvex mixed combinatorial optimization problem due to the binary variables β m n,u as well as the non-convex objective function. In general, there is no efficient method to obtain the globally optimal solutions. To address this issue, in this subsection, we further decouple P2 into a subchannel allocation problem and a power allocation problem, and solve them iteratively.</p><p>1) Subchannel Allocation: With the given power allocation scheme p, the radio resource allocation problem P2 can be simplified into</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">P4 : max β m n,u η s.t. (8c) -(8e). (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>Note that, although the optimal solution of P4 can be obtained by the exhaustive search over all the subchannels under constraints (8c)-(8e), its computational complexity increases exponentially with dimensions. To reduce the computational complexity, we exploit the binary characteristic of β m n,u and apply matching method to solve P4. Specifically, the subchannel allocation problem in P4 can be modeled as a many-to-one matching game <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, where devices and subchannels interact with each other to find the optimal matching.</p><p>We define the IoT device u served by SBS n as u n and define Ψ as the matching function, which has the following properties</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">1) |Ψ (u n )| = 1, ∀u n ∈ U n , ∀n ∈ F , 2) |Ψ (m)| ≤ Z m , ∀m ∈ RB, 3) Ψ (u n ) = m if and only if u n ∈ Ψ (m) , (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where property 1) corresponds to the constraint (8c) and means that each device can only occupy one subchannel to offload task, property 2) corresponds to the constraint (8d) and means that the number of devices occupying the same subchannel m should not exceed Z m , and property 3) means that, if device u n matches with subchannel m, subchannel m also matches with device u n .</p><p>To initiate the matching process, each device u n and subchannel m need to establish the preference lists UP un and SP m , respectively. To this end, we define the utility functions of device u n and subchannel m, respectively, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">W un = η m n,u ,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">W m = ∑ N n=1 ∑ Un u=1 β m n,u η m n,u . (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>Since each user can access to no more than one subchannel, for ∀m ∈ M do</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">W</formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">8: if N ∑ n=1 Un ∑ un=1 β m u ≤ Z m 9:</formula><p>subchannel m holds all the matched devices and remove them from UN U; </p><formula xml:id="formula_25">Ψ v l</formula><p>un remains the same; 22: end if 23: end while descending order, respectively. Then, the matching process can be performed via the swap operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> , defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">Ψ v l un = {(u n , Ψ (v l )) , (v l , Ψ (u n ))} ∪ {Ψ\ {(u n , Ψ (u n )) , (v l , Ψ (v l ))}} ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where (u n , v l ) forms a swap-pair, u n and v l switches with each other while other matching pairs stay unchanged. The definition of the swap-pair is given as follows.</p><p>Definition 1: Device u n and device v l is a swap pair if and only if they satisfy the following requirements:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">1) W s ( Ψ v l un ) ≥ W s (Ψ) , ∀s ∈ {u n , v l , Ψ un , Ψ v l } , 2) W s ( Ψ v l un ) &gt; W s (Ψ) , ∃s ∈ {u n , v l , Ψ un , Ψ v l } , (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">)</formula><p>where U s (Ψ) is the utility function of player s under the matching state Ψ. The requirement 1) means that the swap operation should not reduce the utilities of related players and the requirement 2) means that the swap operation ought to bring benefits to at least one player. Based on the above analysis, the proposed subchannel allocation algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. We firstly analyze its convergence performance. We note that Algorithm 1 guarantees to converge, due to the fact that it is based on the swap operation. According to Definition 1, there exists a swap operation after which no swap pair can be found to further enhance the energy efficiency. More details on how the swap-enabled matching algorithm converges to a two-sided exchange stable matching state can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We now analyze the computational complexity. Note that there are two phases in Algorithm 1, namely the initialization phase and the swap phase. In the initialization phase, the preference lists for all the players are constructed and remain unchanged during the matching process, thus its computational complexity is</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">O ( U M 2 )</formula><p>. In the swap phase, the maximum number of swap</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">operations is 2 × ( U 2</formula><p>) , and therefore the computational complexity of the swap phase is upper bounded by O ( U 2 ) . As such, the computational complexity of Algorithm 1 is</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">max { O ( U M 2 ) , O ( U 2 )}<label>.</label></formula><p>2) Power Allocation: We now focus on the power allocation problem for fixed radio resource allocation β. Note that this problem is still non-convex due to the co-channel interference.</p><p>To tackle this problem, we first transform the objective function, η, from a fractional form to a subtractive form, and apply some approximations to convert it into a convex form. Then, we use Lagrange dual method to obtain the optimal power solution p * .</p><p>Define the maximum energy efficiency as</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">η * = U R (p * ) U P (p * ) = max p U R (p) U P (p) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Performance Analysis of Communication Resource</head><p>We first examine the performance of our proposed algorithms and analyze the effect of communication resource on the offloading energy efficiency in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> -Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> verifies the convergence of our proposed matching algorithm for different number of devices. It is observed that, our proposed matching algorithm can converges to a stationary point within 5-10 iterations for different number of devices. It is also observed that the number of iterations required for convergence increases as the number of devices increase, due to the increased searching space in matching process. In addition, it is seen that, the performance of the proposed 2 We note that this operation may lead to the case where the devices with high energy efficiency are not assigned with computing RBs, when allocating computing RBs to these devices would violate the computation resource constraint.   matching algorithm is close to the exhaustive searching (ES) method, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed matching algorithm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> evaluates the average energy efficiency of our proposed NOMA scheme for different number of devices. For comparison purpose, we also provide the energy efficiencies achieved by the OMA scheme and the NOMA with equal power allocation (NOMA-EPAA) scheme. Note that, in the NOMA-EPAA scheme, the transmission power of each device is equally distributed among all the subchannels. It is seen that, for all three schemes, the energy efficiency increases as the number of SBSs increases. It is also seen that, when the number of SBSs is small, the advantage of our proposed NOMA-enabled scheme over the OMA scheme is not significant. This is because, the subchannels in the system are able to support the uplink transmissions of all the devices when the number of devices is small.

With the fixed number of devices, the average energy efficiency grows with Z m , due to the fact that more devices can be accommodated by the system with a larger Z m and subsequently the system throughput increases. In addition, the growth rate becomes smaller when Z m becomes relatively large, since more co-channel interference are introduced to the same subchannel as Z m increases.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, we plot the connection density ratio versus the maximum number of devices sharing the same subchannel. Specifically, the connection density ratio is defined as the number of scheduled devices divided by the number of all the devices. The scheduled devices are those scheduled to offload their tasks in the same transmission interval. Similar as in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, it is seen that the connection density ratio increases with Z m . In addition, for a given Z m , the connection density ratio decreases as the number of devices increases. This is because the number of scheduled devices are only determined by the number of subchannels and the value of Z m . Thus, the more devices leads to the larger denominator and the smaller connection density ratio.</p><p>The relationship between the average energy efficiency and the maximum transmission power of each device is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. We can see that, for a fixed number of devices, the energy efficiency increases with the maximum transmission power, which demonstrates that the sum rate grows faster than the system power consumption. In addition, we see that the performance gap between our proposed NOMA scheme and the OMA scheme increases as the number of devices increases, showing how the application of NOMA can significantly enhance the system performance by allowing multiple devices to share the same channel resources simultaneously. Next, we show how the proposed scheme can ensure the device fairness in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. In this figure, Jain's fairness index [?] is adopted as the metric for the device fairness, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">F airness Index = ( ∑ M m=1 η m ) 2 M × ∑ M m=1 (η m ) 2 . (<label>37</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_74">)</formula><p>The value of Jain's fairness index can vary from 0 and 1, and fairness of resource allocation scheme increases as the value increases. It is observed that, for all three schemes, Jain's fairness index decreases with the number of devices in each SBS. The reason is that, with more devices, the competition for limited radio and computation resources becomes more fierce. Consequently, more devices with poor channel conditions are not allowed to access the subchannel and more offloaded tasks of devices with smaller contribution to energy efficiency are not allowed to be computed in the SBS. Moreover, it is seen that, with fixed number of devices, our proposed NOMA scheme achieves the best fairness performance and OMA scheme is the worst, due to the fact that NOMA technique enhances the utilization of multi-device diversity.</p><p>The proposed NOMA scheme outperforms the NOMA-EPAA scheme in fairness due to the fairer and more reasonable power allocation method. Furthermore, it is worth noting that by allowing more devices sharing the same subchannel, both three schemes are able to achieve higher fairness indices, which is also attributed to the utilization of multi-device diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Performance Analysis of Computation Resource</head><p>In the following, we examine the impact of computation resource on the offloading performance in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> -Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> evaluates the average energy efficiency of different schemes versus the number of computing RBs in each SBS. It can be seen that, for a fixed number of devices, the average energy efficiency first increases and then approaches a fixed value as the number of computing RBs increases. This is because, when the number of computing RBs is small, increasing the number of computing RBs enables each SBS to process more offloaded tasks. However, when the number of computing RBs becomes relatively large, each SBS is capable of processing all the offloaded tasks. As such, increasing the number computing RBs at each SBS does not improve the average energy efficiency. This is consistent with our analysis in Section III-B, which again indicates that the number of computing RBs assigned to each SBS should be in accordance with the number of its serving devices. Moreover, it is seen that, as expected, our proposed NOMA scheme outperforms the OMA scheme, and the performance gap increases as the number of devices increases.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, the impact of the size of offloaded tasks at each device on energy efficiency performance is investigated. It is observed that the average energy efficiency decreases as the size of offloaded task increases.  the same constraint of its tolerable delay when the size of tasks increases. Consequently, less tasks can be handled in a slot and thus leads to the reduction of average energy efficiency. It is also observed that the reduction of average energy efficiency becomes less significant as the number of computing RBs at each SBS increases from 800 to 1600.</p><p>Finally, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> examines the relationship between the average energy efficiency and the maximum tolerable delay of each device for a fixed number of devices and different number of computing RBs in each SBS n, i.e., U = 1000 and CB n = {400, 800}. Again, it is seen that our proposed NOMA scheme always achieves a better performance than the OMA scheme, and the performance gap is more profound when the maximum tolerable delay is small. It is also seen that the average energy efficiency of both NOMA and OMA schemes increases as the maximum tolerable delay increases. This is because, when the delay constraint becomes loose, the number of computing RBs required for each device meeting the delay constraint decreases, which in turn increases the throughput of the system. Similarly, the energy efficiency decreases sharply as the delay restriction becomes strict. Besides, it is worth noting that the average energy efficiency tends to be constant when the tolerable delay is relatively large. The reason is that delay is a key limiting factor in energy efficiency performance when it is small. When it is large enough, its influence on energy efficiency is no longer working.</p></div>
