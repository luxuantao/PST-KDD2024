<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formulation an Solution of Least Norm Problems for</head><p>Sabine Van Huffel, Member, IEEE, Haesun Park, Member, IEEE, and J. Ben Rosen Abstract-The total least squares (TLS) method is a generalization of the least squares (LS) method for solving overdetermined sets of linear eqiiiations A x z b. The TLS method minimizes I / [ E l -~] l / r , as that of finding E and x such that where T = b -(A + E ) z , given A E C"'", with m 2 n:</p><p>and b E C m X 1 .</p><p>This problem allows the possibility of error in the elements of a given matrix A so that the modified matrix is given by A + E , where E is a correction matrix to be determined. The TLS solution is commonly obtained from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of <ref type="bibr">[AJb]</ref> [27] and is able to compute a strongly consistent estimate of the true solution IC when the errors in the data matrix <ref type="bibr">[Alb]</ref> are rowwise independently and identically distributed with zero mean and equal variance. If, in addition, the errors are normally distributed, the TLS solution has maximum likelihood properties. However, these nice properties are lost in applications where the matrix A has a special structure since then, the errors are (non)linearly related, and the TLS method does not preserve this special structure. In fact, the matrix E obtained from the SVD will typically be dense, with no structure, even whe,n A is structured or sparse.</p><p>Recently, a new problem known as structured totall least norm (STLN) has been presented and can be formulated as follows [20] and 1:21]. Consider a structured matrix A E CFXn, of which q(5mn) different elements are subject to error, and define a vector Q: E Cq representing the corresponding elements of the structured correction matrix E .</p><p>If many elements of E must have the same value, then q is the number of different such elements. The vector cv and the matrix E are equivalent in the sense that given E ~ a is known, and vice versa. Then, the residual vector r = b -(A + E ) z , is a function of (0, E). Let D E R q x 4 be a diagonal weighting matrix that accounts for the repetition of elements of n: in the matrix E . Then, the STLN problem can be stated as where 1) . \Ip is the vector p n o m for p = 1. 2, or CO. For p = 2 and a suitable choice for D , problem (2) is equivalent to the TLS problem (l), with the additional requirement that the matrix E must have the given structure. Algorithms for computing the STLN solution have been developed <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[2 L]</ref>. The STLN method preserves any given affine structure in E or [El-r] and can minimize these corrections in the discrete L, norm, where p = 1. 2 or 00 <ref type="bibr">[2 11</ref>. A theoretical justification and computational testing of 1053-587)3/96$05.00 0 1996 IEEE the STLN algorithm confirm that it is an efficient method for solving structured problems or when errors can occur only in some of the elements of A or [AJb] <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>. For instance, when the matrix A has Toeplitz or Hankel structure, the new approach guarantees that E has the same Toeplitz structure as A or that only those elements of E that correct possible noisy elements of il are permitted to be nonzero. For earlier work on problems in which the errors occur in a restricted manner, see <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> and [26l, and for the use of 151 norm in total approximation, see <ref type="bibr">[17 and [30]</ref>. The extension of the TLS solution to incorporate the algebraic pattern of the errors in A is also studied in <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> but both for the La norm only. For a comparison of these two algorithms, see <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. The approach in our algorithm is different from these two, as will become clear later on.</p><p>Cur study of STLN problems (in several norms) is motivated by the numerical and theoretical results reported in marly papers (see e.g., <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> and [27] for an overview), which show that a total least norm fitting ( p = 1, 2, m) does give bettlx results than ordinary least norm fitting (in which only b is corrected) when all data in [AJb] have errors. A strategy for choosing p is not simple, and some discussion on this topi; is included in [25]. In particular, for p = 1, it is well kno m that the solution of the ordinary least 1 -norm problem rnin [(Az -15111 is less sensitive to outliers than the solution witl-other norms. A theoretical analysis in <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref> shows that the robustness of least norm fitting and total least norm fitting is similar for p = 1, implying that the TLN solution for p = 1 is also less sensitive to outliers than the TLN solution for other norrns (e.g., p = 2, 00). This robustness of the TLN problem for 11 = 1 compared with that of the TLN problem for p = 2 is also shown for structured problems (i.e., for the STLN problem concidered here) in our preliminary experiments, as reported in a recent paper <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. This is one important aspect of the STLN formulation, in addition to the fact that it can preserve the problem structure.</p><p>This paper extends the study of the STLN problem presented in <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref> in the following way. First of all, we show, in Section IV, how to generalize the STLN problem formulation to structured TLN problems with multiple right-hand side vectxs A X M B and how to compute the corresponding STLN solution. This is an important feature that allows us to solve structure-preserving rank reduction problems for any given rank deficiency. On the other hand, the methods presented in [I] and [6] cannot be directly used for problems with multiple right-hand sides. For clarity of exposition, we brielly describe the STLN algorithms for structured A and [A/hl, as presented in [20] and <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>, in Sections I1 and 111. Second, in Section V, convergence properties in model reduction problems are discussed, and finally, in Section VI, the STLN method is applied to various problems in system iden ification and signal processing in which the data matrix is Toeplitz, and the correction matrix E or [El -7-1 preserves the same structure. The presented results also hold for Hankel structures since Hankel matrices simply transform to Toeplitz matrices by permutations. Although STLN has this flexibility of allowing any vector norm, we focus in this paper on its two-norm solutions, mainly because this norm is most often used in signal processing. In addition, this norm gives a fair comparison to the currently used LS and TLS methods in the applications under study.</p></div>

This is accomplished by defining a matrix X E E C"'q such that X E Q = Ex. The matrix X E consists of the elements of 2 , with suitable repetition, giving X E a special structure. In fact, E and X E have exactly the same number of nonzero elements. The construction of XE (starting with a zero matrix) is carried out according to the following rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">If m.k: is the (i, j ) t h element of E , then xj is the ( i , k)th element of X E , where i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, -G , n,</formula><p>and k = 1, ' " , q.</p><p>For example, assume that all six diagonals of a 4 x 3 Toeplitz matrix are subject to error, and the matrix E is also Toeplitz with first column [as a 4 a 5 a6IT and first row [a3 a2 all.

For a general matrix M , the standard QR decomposition algorithms require 0 [ ( m iq ) ( n + q ) ' 1 flops. When A is Toeplitz, a fast triangularization of M can be performed in O(mn2 + m 2 ) flops, as described in [20, Section VI. Note that when A is Toeplitz, q is at most m + n -1, and when q 5 n , even the general algorithms only require 0 (mn2) flops.</p><p>For p = 2 and q = m n , i.e., A is unstructured, the STLN solution coincides with the ordinary TLS solution according to 'our experiments. Note, however, that the STLN algorithm has a much higher complexity than the SVD-based TLS algorithms [121&gt; [27] and is therefore not recommended for solving unstructured TLS problems.</p><p>In contrast to ordinary TLS, LS, and mixed LS-TLS problems [27], the STLN solution can no longer be expressed as the solution of a set of linear equations, and therefore, no closed-form sollution for the STLN problem can be derived.</p><p>For p = 2, the convergence of Algorithm STLN is proven to be equivalent to satisfying the optimality conditions for the miinimization problem (2) 1211. In addition, it is shown in [21] that Algorithm STLN is essentially a Gauss-Newton method. Of course, the known limitations of the Gauss-Newton method also apply to Algorithm STLN. For example, we need a small residual for fast convergence.</p><p>It should be noted that the differentiable function p(a, x) = r H r + i ceHD2a we wish to minimize in (2) forp = 2, is not a c:onvex function of ((2, 2;). Therefore, there is no guarantee thad a point satisfying the first-order optimality conditions V,,p = -X g r + D2cu = 0 and V,p = -( A + E ) H r = 0, is a global minimum. In fact, it could be any stationary point of CY, x). In general, the Gauss-Newton method will converge to the closest local minimum when the residual r ( ( v , x) is sufficiently small <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. For STLN problems with p : = 1 and p = 00, the objective function is not differentiable. Convergence results can be proven (with suitable assumptions) in a way similar to that given in <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> and are currently being studied (see also <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>). Toeplitz. In this section, it is shown how Algorithm STLN is modified so that it can deal with structured errors in the righthand side vector b as well <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>. First, a vector , ! ? representing possible corrections in selected different elements of b is defined, which is similar to a representing errors in A. When different errors can occur in l ( &lt; m ) elements of b, then the corrections applied to these elements are represented by the vector E C'. A matrix F E RTnx' is introduced so that the corrections applied to b are the same as FP: The matrix F fans out the elements of P to the corresponding entries in the vector b. The (2; j)th element of F is one if is the correction to b;; otherwise, it is zero. Initially, E , CY, and , ! ! I are all zero, and the residual i = r = b -Ax. In general,</p></div>

Preliminary promising results of the former application are reported in [3 1. For the latter application, time-domain algorithms based on the structured TLS method [6] and [8], which are optimal with respect to a finite-horizon &amp;norm, have been developed recently for single-input single-output systems and are discussed in [9] and 1231. Some of these algorithms have been tran:iformed to the z domain, thereby enabling computation of t i e optimal reduced model with respect to the Lz norm (over an infinite horizon) and the Hilbert-Schmidt-Hankel norrn [7], <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The most salient shortcoming of these STLStype approximation algorithms is the fact that they cannot deal with multi-input multi-output systems because the STLS method cannot be easily extended to reduce the rank of a given structured matrix by more than one.

COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS: COMPARISON OF STLN WITH Ls AND TLS IN PARAMETER ESTIMATION PROBLEMS</head><p>The algorithms STLN and STLNB have been implemented in MATLAB in order to investigate their performance in problems where structured matrices are involved. In particular, we here compare the accuracy of these algorithms with that of the currently used LS and TLS methods in several signal processing and system identification problems in order to show the gain in accuracy one can expect by exploiting the structure of the problem. Other computational tests are reported in <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>. For the effect on the algorithm behavior of structure, initial choice of 5 , the magnitude of the minimum norm, and the choice of the L, norm, see also <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Test Procedure: We start from m + n -1 data samples</p><p>x; arranged in an m x n Toeplitz matrix A, and set up the zero residual set of equations A,X, = B, by either choosing a specific exact solution X , or right-hand side matrix B,. Random errors that are normally distributed with mean zerc, and variance C J ~ are then added to the data z; and B,, generating the perturbed set A X E B. We denote the vectorized LS, TLS, and STLN solution of this perturbed set by .cis , xtls , x s t l n , respectively. The relative errors 6 : ' 11x, -x , -~~/ ~~x , ~~ with cv = Is, tls, or stln are averaged over 100 runs per g r , . These tests are repeated for progressively 1argl:r o],. If not stated otherwise, the L2 norm STLN solution is cj3mputed in 10 iterations, and the matrix M always has full column rank.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E s t Problems:</head><p>We first consider a linear prediction (LP) protilem, which is described in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>. In addition to the relalive accuracy of the LP solution vector 2 , we show the rela1 ive accuracy of damping factor and frequency estimates obtained by finding the roots of the computed LP polynomial in each run, as in Prony's method. Observe that STLN improves the accuracy of the TLS estimates with a factor 30 to 40 for noise standard deviations up to whereas the differences in accuracy between TLS and LS remain negligible! For C T ~ = the frequency accuracy improves by a factor of more than 400.</p><p>Algorithm STLNB can also be used for computing the rank T Toeplitz approximation of any m x r i Toeplitz matrix C , as described at the end of Section IV and shown below. The above LP problem is extended to a problem with multiple righ1:-hand sides, as described below. Consider the Toeplitz matrix C, = [A,)B,], where A, is the same matrix as described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I1</ref>   e-10 6.43e-8 6.43e-8 4.38e-9</p><p>1 e-8 I 7.35e-6 7.35e-6 4.47e-7 I e-6 6.20e-4 6.15e-4 4.48e-5 structure. Perturb C, to C. as described in the test procedure, and compute the best rank 8 matrix approximation for C using the LS, TLS, and STLN method. Only the STLN method is able to preserve the Toeplitz structure. The results are described in Table <ref type="table">111</ref>. Observe that STLN improves the solution accuracy by a factor of 15. In all test cases considered here, the d smallest singular values of the STLN approximation [A + E113 + ( F I B . . . Fdp)] were smaller than after 10 iterations. We also computed the average Frobenius norm corrls, corrtls, and corrstln of the corresponding LS, TLS, and STLN correction matrices <ref type="bibr">[E71Fq]</ref> computed by means of method y such that (A + E,)X, = B + F,, where 7 = LS, TLS, or STLN. For ov = lo-', we obtained corrls = 6 . 2 0 ~1 0 -~. corrtli = 1.24x1OP7, andcorrStln = 1.89x10V7. The average Frobenius norm of the true perturbation matrix was = 2.22 x lop7. This is a typical result. As can easily be proven, corrtls is always minimal; corrstln is only slightly larger and always less than corrtrue, whereas corrls is considerably larger than all other values.</p><p>Next, we explore the use of STLN in time-domuin sysi'em identification. If the process can be modeled as an LTI, causal, finite-dimensional system with zero-initial state, then an impulse response model may be used:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">n y(t) = h(k)U(t -k ) .

This so-called deconvolution problem   <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">IV</ref>(a). I f u ( t ) is zero for t &lt; 0, then the strictly upper triangular part of A is zero.

The beneficial effect of taking the structure into account is clearly shown at any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Indeed, for all noise variances considered, the STLN estimates of the coefficients a,, b; are two to four times more accurate than the corresponding TLS estimates. Note also that the gain in accuracy obtained by ordinary TLS compared with LS is negligible for high SNR. Only at very low SNR, the gain in accuracy can improve up to a factor 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI[. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>A recently presented new method [20] and [21] related to total least squares (TLS) known as structured total least norm (STLN) for solving overdetermined sets of linear equations Ax N b has been summarized, where A or [Alb] is structured and affected by noise. The main new features of this approach are that it preserves the problem structure and permits the minimization of error in different norms as well, which is important in certain problems to improve robustness of the solution.</p><p>The STLN problem is generalized to structured sets       converges to the optimal solution in model reduction problems for which the global optimum can be derived analytically.</p><p>The benefits of the STLN method in various parameter estimation problems, such as linear prediction, impulse response estimation of multivariable systems, and transfer funclion modeling, are studied. The Lz norm STLN method is compared with the LS and TLS methods and shown to improve the accuracy of the parameter estimates by a factor 2 to 40 at any SNR.</p><p>In order to more fully investigate the potential of the STLN problem formulation and algorithms for a range of applications, a number of areas need further study. The benefits of thl-STLN approach and the computational performance of the STLN algorithms need to be investigated in much larger problems arising in actual applications, e.g., in signal enhancement and signal reconstruction and NMR data quantification. The STLN algorithms need further improvements in cases of near rank deficiency of A and ill conditioning of the kernel problem solved in each iteration. In addition, the convergence rate needs further analysis. More refined algorithms with better convergence properties are currently under study [ 151.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 and STLN solution x Begin 1 )</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Input-A structured total least norm problem (2), with specified matrices A, D . vector b, and tolerance t 0utput-Cl"rtion matrix [E 1 -7-Set E = 0, CY = 0, compute x from (6) and 2) rer&gt;eatX E from x j and set r = b -Ax. b) Set L := z + Axj N := N + Aa.c) Construct X E from ic and E from cy.
