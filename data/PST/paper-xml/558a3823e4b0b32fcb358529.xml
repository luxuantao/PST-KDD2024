<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper examines the kinematic model of an autonomous mobile robot system consisting of a chain of steerable cars and passive trailers, liked together with rigid bars. The state space and kinematic equations of the system are defined, and it is shown how these kinematic equations may be converted into a multiinput chained form. The advantages of the chained form are that many methods are available for the open-loop steering of such systems as well as for point-stabilization; some of these methods are discussed here. Dynamic state feedback is used to convert the system to this multiinput chained form. It is shown how the dynamic state feedback that is used in this paper corresponds to adding, in front of the steerable cars, a chain of virtual axles which diverges from the original chain of trailers.</p><p>Two different example systems are also presented, along with simulation results for a parallel-parking maneuver.</p></div>

INTRODUCTION</head><p>N this paper, the motion planning problem for a car-like I mobile robot pulling a combination of n passive trailers and m -1 car-like robots is considered and solved. The controls available to the system are the velocity (throttle) of the lead car and the steering velocities of all m car-like robots. The system is referred to as a multisteering n-trailer system. It can be thought of as a generalization of an n-trailer system, in which the only two controls available were the driving and steering velocities of the lead car, and for which the motion planning problem was considered and solved in [16] and [19]. Mobile robot systems of this kind are of interest in practical applications; part of the motivation for this work came from previous work on the fire truck [4], [18].

In all of these applications it is felt that a multisteering system will be more maneuverable than a single-steering system.</p><p>Such systems are modeled as having one constraint on each axle: that the wheels are allowed to roll but not to slip. These nonslipping constraints are nonholonomic, or nonintegrable, and do not reduce the reachable configuration space of the mobile robot. The existence of differentials in systems of this kind results in the two wheels of a single axle moving through different amounts in the course of a turn <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>; this has not been explicitly taken into account in this work.</p><p>The present system appears at first glance to be a straightforward extension of the systems considered in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, but the main motivation in writing this paper is to show how much richer and more complex the current system is in its structure. As before, the kinematic equations will be converted into a chained form. The transformation, however, will require dynamic state feedback. Motivated by the physical structure of the constraints involved in this particular problem, the dynamic state feedback that is used consists of adding virtual axles to each of the steerable cars in the system. The chained form, which was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and used in earlier work on the single-steering n-trailer system in <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, enables a variety of previously developed steering and stabilization techniques to be applied.</p><p>A particularly intriguing aspect of this work is its connection with an emerging body of literature on differentially flat systems by Hiess and his co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. They have shown that chained form systems are a special case of differentially flat systems: the bottoms of the chains in the chained form play the role of flat outputs. For the two input case, it was pointed out by Martin <ref type="bibr">[ l l ]</ref> and Murray [131 that, modulo somewhat different regularity conditions, chained form systems are equivalent to flat systems for the type of drift-free systems that arise in nonholonomic motion planning. The results of the current paper indicate that this is not true for systems with more than two inputs without allowing for the possibility of dynamic state feedback. As such this work provides a valuable counterpoint to the results of Gardner and Shadwick <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Bushnell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>U. THE SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>Consider a multisteering trailer system, i.e., a system of n (passive) trailers and m (steerable) cars linked together by rigid bars, sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Each body (trailer or car) is modeled as having only one axle, since, as has been 1042-296W95$04.00 0 1995 IEEE Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. A multitrailer system with n (passive) trailers and m stemable axles.</p><p>shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, a two-axle car is equivalent (under coordinate transformation and state feedback) to a one-axle car towing one trailer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Conjiguration Space</head><p>The steering axles are numbered from front to back, starting with 1 and going up to m, and the passive axles are numbered similarly from 1 to n. There are a total of n + m axles in the system. The angle of each passive axle with respect to the horizontal will be represented by 0: where i E { 1, . . . , n } is the axle number and j E { 1, . . . , m} is the number of the steerable axle most directly in front of that axle. Each steerable axle together with the passive axles directly behind it is called a steering train.</p><p>The steerable axles may be interspersed among the passive axles in any fashion. The subscript of the passive axle directly in front of the jth steerable axle is nJ-l for j = 2, .. . , m.</p><p>By convention, the first axle is assumed to be steerable, and thus no = 0. The superscripts associate the set of passive trailers behind each steerable car with that car. The angle of the first axle with respect to the horizontal is denoted by 0;. There are n1 passive trailers in the first steering train; their angles are denoted e:, . . . , e,&amp;. The axle directly behind the first steering train is steerable; its angle with respect to the horizontal is the superscript representing that it is in the second steering train. For convenience of notation, let n, E n, although in general the last axle will not be steerable. If the last axle is steerable, then n,-1 = n,.</p><p>This system as defined is very general, and includes the following as special cases:</p><p>1) the standard n trailer system of Let dJ denote the absolute angle (with respect to the horizontal) of the bar connecting the ( j + 1)st steerable axle to the last axle of the 9th steering train (which may be either steerable or passive).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Kinematic Equations</head><p>The most direct way to construct a kinematic model for this system is to write the differential form constraints representing the nonslipping of the wheels in terms of the configuration variables, and then construct the input vector fields as the right null space of the constraints. Dualizing the n + m constraints (one for each axle) in a configuration space of n + 2m + 1 state variables, a control system with m + 1 inputs results.</p><p>The input vector fields for the steering inputs are constant vector fields, but the driving vector field takes on a much more complex form which would take a good deal of organization and bookkeeping to derive in its general form.</p><p>For this reason, the kinematic model in this paper has been constructed in a somewhat different manner. Although eventually, the linear velocity of the front car will be considered as one of the inputs, it is convenient to define the kinematic equations in terms of the linear velocity of the last body. The projections of this velocity onto the horizontal and vertical directions will be the derivatives of the state variables x and y, respectively. Proceeding toward the front of the train, velocities of each body can be recursively defined in terms of the linear and angular velocities of the bodies behind it in the train. This procedure defines all the derivatives of the angles of the passive axles as well as the derivatives of the hitch angles. All that remains are the derivatives of the steering angles, which are defined to be the inputs.</p><p>Starting at the rear of the train, let the linear velocity of the last body be denoted wTm. Then the derivatives of x and y are the projections of this velocity onto the horizontal and vertical directions, y = sin erm vn", x = cos on", Vn",.</p><p>Let vi represent the linear velocity of the axle with angle 0:. Consider first the case of a passive trailer; refer to Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> for clarification. Although this figure has been drawn for two passive trailers, these calculations are still valid when the front body (z -1) is steerable.</p><p>The linear velocity of body i -1 can be broken into its two perpendicular components: one is in the direction of the linear velocity of body i, and the other is along the direction of the angular velocity of body i. The two linear velocities are related by the cosine of the angle between them, (1) U; = cos (O;-l -0;) and the projection of the angular velocity is by the sine of the difference angle, L; 4; = sin (0;--0;</p><p>(2) which gives the kinematic equations for the angles of the passive trailers, 8;.</p><p>The equations are only slightly more complicated when the rear body is a steerable car instead of a passive trailer (refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Projecting onto the line connecting the two bodies, the relationship between the two linear velocities is u;;1 cos (8;;l -$ 3 ) = v i 3 cos ( -$ 3 ) , that is, both velocities are multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the velocity vector and the connecting bar. Now, because the velocity of the rear body, vi:', is no longer perpendicular to the angular velocity vector LA? &amp; , this linear velocity will also contribute to the angular velocity &amp; .</p><p>Adding up the contributions of the two linear velocities, the relationship ~; ~+ , i 3 = sin -q~)v;:~sin -$ 3 ) ~; ~ for j E { 1, .... m -1) defines the kinematics of the hitch angles.</p><p>Since the derivatives of the steering wheel angles are free variables, that is, they are not constrained by the kinematics, they can be considered to be controlled by the inputs, w3.

A more general chained form [ 141 can have more than one generating input, and thus multiple chains leading down from each input.

Some sufficient conditions for converting two-input drift-free systems into chained form were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In later work <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in the context of steering the fire truck, sufficient conditions were given for converting a multiinput system into a multiinput chained form. Necessary and sufficient conditions for converting two-input systems into chained form were given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where a connection was made between the chained form and its dual in the terminology of one-forms, called the Goursat normal form. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> these results were applied to convert the system of a car with n trailers into Goursat form. The calculations in this context were simplified by the use of a coordinatization of the state space of the car with n trailers introduced in [16].</p><p>In fact, the techniques of Sgrdalen were a way of systematically converting systems of n trailers into chained form by noticing that the trajectory of the (x, 3) position of the last trailer determines the evolution of all the state variables of the system, since the ratio of their derivatives will give the angle of the trailer through the relationship Yn tan 8, = , .</p><p>The hitch relationships can then be used to find the position of the second-to-last trailer, and its angle, and so forth. This was also noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>

Extension with "Virtual" Trailers z? = 2+1 i;</formula><p>The technique that is used in this paper to convert the multisteering trailer system into chained form is now straightforward to explain. From a physical intuition about the system, those states which determine the trajectories of the system are identified. These states become the bottoms of the chains of integrators in the chained form, as mentioned above, and the rest of the coordinate transformation is found through differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. It is then verified that the transformation found in this manner is a local diffeomorphism and a valid change of coordinates. There is currently no generalization to the Goursat normal form for multiinput systems which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for converting systems into multiinput chained form using dynamic state feedback. For the multisteering system of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the (x, y) position of the last trailer along with all the hitch angles {$I, . . . , #m-l} between steering trains will determine the entire state of the system. To see this, consider the last steering train: using the technique described above for the n-trailer single-steering case, all the angles of the trailers up to and including that of the last (or mth) steerable axle can be found. However, the hitch angle @"' ahead of this axle will not be determined by anything behind it. This is the reason that its evolution as a function of time is needed to specify the entire state of the system. The knowledge of the hitch angle $m-l will allow the Cartesian coordinates of the midpoint of the last axle of the second-to-last steering train to be found, and this information can be used to find the angles of all the axles in this steering train, and so forth until the front of the entire chain is reached.</p><p>Another possible choice for the states at the bottoms of the chains are the ya values of the midpoints of the axles in front of each of the steerable axles. The resulting chained form is the same, with the same number of states added through dynamic state feedback. The coordinate transformation required to put the system into the chained form, however, will be different.</p><p>In related work (see [6] and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>), the idea that certain variables determine the entire state of the system has been formalized in a more general setting, and these system variables have been referred to as$at outputs. y = h(x, U ) are defined to beflat for the system x = f ( x , U ) if all of the system variables (states and inputs) are differential functions of the outputs y; that is, x and U are meromorphic functions of the outputs y and finitely many of their derivatives. Equivalently, the flat outputs are outputs with respect to which the system has no zero dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. A system is called differentiallyjut if a set of flat outputs can be found. Moreover, there may be many choices for the flat outputs. The multiinput chained form <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> although chained form systems with more than one generator are not in general flat.</p><p>is differentially flat with flat outputs zoo,</p></div>

To keep the resulting system drift-free and affine in the inputs, it will be required that this feedback has the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E = 4 x , t b U =Y(X, 8 . .</formula><p>The states E that are added through dynamic feedback will be interpreted physically as the angles of "virtual" axles in front of the steerable axles, diverging from the chain of trailers. The new input v will correspond to the driving velocity together with the steering velocities of the virtual cars, and the feedback on U will be defined such that the actual steerable cars are controlled through the chain of virtual trailers.</p><p>For some insight into this formulation of virtual axles, consider the well-known example of a unicycle, sketched in Fig. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>. The body is allowed to drive either forward or backward and to spin about its axis.</p><p>The kinematic model takes as inputs the linear velocity 'U and the angular velocity w of the body, j. = cos Bw y = sin Qv 0 = w .</p><p>Since the system is drift-free, the relative degree of any choice of outputs will be equal to one (the input appears directly in every state equation). In the sequel, when considering the multisteering trailer system, the relative degree of the states with respect to the steering inputs will be of interest. Note that the relative degree of the body angle 8 with respect to the steering input is equal to one.</p><p>Consider the dynamic feedback</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">$ = a w = tan($ -8)w.</formula><p>The added state ~ has an attractive physical interpretation of being the angle of another axle added in front of the original steerable axle, and the new input CII is the steering velocity of this "virtual" axle. This is represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. In addition, the relative degree of the body angle Q with respect to the new (virtual) steering input is now equal to two. The linear velocity at the front axle can be denoted by wf, and it is related to the linear velocity of the rear wheel by the cosine of the angle between them,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">U = COS (IC, -Q ) u u ~.</formula><p>Thus, the extended system equations can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x = COS Qw y = sin Qw</formula><p>Remark: Any valid trajectory y = (z, y, 8, 4) of the system (7) can be projected down, via the standard projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Also, for any trajectory C of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> for which O(t) is C1 and for which 8 = 0 whenever ri: = y = 0, there exists a trajectory y such that ~( 7 ) = C. Trajectories where the unicycle spins about its axis without moving either forward or backward cannot be achieved with the extended model. This is the motivation for a dynamic state feedback that adds virtual axles to the system. Each virtual axle that is added in front of a steerable axle increases by one the relative degree of its hitch angle with respect to the steering input at the hitch.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T : IR2 x (S1)2 + Et2 x SI, to give a valid trajectory ~(y) = = (x, y, 6' ) of</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Virtual Extension for the Multisteering System</head><p>It will now be described in detail how the kinematic model ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is locally converted to a multiinput chained form using dynamic state feedback and a coordinate transformation.</p><p>As described in Section III-A, the states at the bottoms of the chains are chosen to be 2, 4l, .... 4m-1, y. Consider the front-most hitch angle 4'; this will become the state at the bottom of the first chain, or z:,+~. Its relative degree with respect to the first steering input u 1 is equal to n1+ 2, or one more than the number of axles in the first steering train. In order to define all the states z1 in the first chain by (5), q 5 l will need to be differentiated a total of n1+ 2 times. However, since 4' depends on all the angles behind it in the trailer system according to (3), the relative degree of $1 with respect to any of the other steering inputs u2, .... um will be equal to two. The derivatives of these inputs should not appear in the coordinate transformation. In order to increase the relative degree of $1 with respect to the other steering inputs, n1 virtual axles will be added in front of each steering axle for j E (2, e . . , m}. The virtual inputs are temporarily denoted by 123, the angular velocities of the axles at the front of each virtual chain.  After continuing similarly for 42, . a , +m-l, y, a total of n3 virtual axles will have been added in front of the jth steerable axle, as has been sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Now there are the same number of passive axles between an axle 0: on the chain and any (virtual) steerable axle, and this is the same as the number of passive axles between the axle Qq and the front steering wheel 6;. After these virtual axles have been added, the jth steering train now contains n3 axles, of which only n3 -n3-1 are real (physical). The only axles which are considered as steerable in this formulation are the first axles of each virtual extension, or 6; for j E { 1, .... m}.</p><p>The state variables that have been introduced, which correspond to the angles of these virtual trailers, are denoted by Q: f o r j E (2, + . e , m } , i E (0, -" , nJ-1-1}.Theirderivatives are defined as if they were actual axles,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">0; = p J , LI<label>(8)</label></formula><p>for j E (2, .... m} and i E (1, .... n3-1 -l}, where LI is an arbitrarily chosen positive parameter (usually chosen to be equal to one for simplicity).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. STEERING CHAINED FORM SYSTEMS</head><p>Once a system is in multiinput chained form, many different algorithms can be used to steer it. Three methods are briefly described in this section; all three of them were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and 1191 for steering two-input systems in chained form. The basic idea behind each of the three methods is to parameterize the input space with at least as many parameters as there are states, integrate the chained form equations symbolically, and finally, solve for the input parameters in terms of the desired initial and final states.</p><p>Various approaches for feedback stabilization of chained form systems are also mentioned. Although most of the work in these areas have concentrated on two-input systems, the decoupled form of the multiinput chained form system will allow the techniques to be generalized in a straightforward manner.</p><p>In this section no particular system of trailers or nonlinear equations will be considered. The problem that is solved in this section is as follows: Given a system of equations in multiinput chained form (4) and a desired initial and final state, find inputs which will steer the system from the initial state to the final state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Polynomial Inputs</head><p>One approach to the point-to-point steering problem is to hold the first input uo constant and identically equal to one over the entire trajectory. The time needed to steer is then determined from the change in the 20" coordinate,</p><p>The parameters for the remaining inputs are chosen to be coefficients of a Taylor polynomial, um = vo + v1t + . . . + vnm+ltn,+l <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref> with the number of parameters on each input chosen to be equal to the number of states in its chain. The chained form equations can be integrated symbolically and the input parameters a3, ,B3, . . ) v3 can be found in terms of the initial and final states. This is a fairly simple procedure since all of the equations that need to be solved are linear. Of course, if the time needed for steering is zero from (25), then this method will not work. This case corresponds in the physical system to the "parallel-parking'' dn-ection, or no net change in the x coordinate. The easiest way to remedy this situation is to first choose an intermediate point and then plan the path in two pieces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Piecewise Constant Inputs</head><p>This steering method was originally inspired by multirate digital control <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, but is most easily understood in terms of motion planning simply as piecewise constant inputs. The first input uo is chosen to be constant over the entire trajectory. This choice will ensure the linearity of the equations that need to be solved for the other input parameters, as well as generate "nice" trajectories (since this input is related to the driving input of the multitrailer system, a constant uo will usually transform to a uni-directional velocity, or equivalently no back-ups).</p><p>The other inputs are chosen to be piecewise constant, and to guarantee that the resulting equations have ,a solution, each input should have at least as many switches as there are states in its chain. There will need to be the largest number of switches on the mth input since it has the longest chain (by definition).</p><p>The time for the trajectory can be chosen arbitrarily as T.</p><p>The first input is constant over the entire trajectory, uo(t) = U&amp; for t E [0, T), where the magnitude is such that the first chained form state will move from its initial to its final position over the time period, The other inputs are piecewise constant. Let the switching times be</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">U$ = on nmow 0 = tt &lt; ti &lt; &lt; t i 3 + 2 = T,</formula><p>where n3 + 2 switching times are needed for each input since there are n3 +2 states in the jth chain. There are many different methods available for choosing these times. They are most commonly chosen so that for the mth input, which has the most switching times, the holding times will be equal. The switching times for the other inputs are then chosen to be some subset of the switching times for the mth input. The jth input will be of the following form: u"t) = ukk fort E [ t k , tk+l). When the chained form equations are integrated using these input values, the final state can be expressed in terms of the inputs and the initial state as where the matrices A3 are assured to be nonsingular whenever the first input U&amp; is nonzero <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Similarly to the previous section, if the first input does come out to be zero from (27), then a slight modification of this method is necessary. A multirate input can also be added on uo, using at least two time periods, or an intermediate point can be chosen and the path can be planned in two steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Sinusoidal Inputs</head><p>A method for steering multichained systems with sinusoids was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This method is step-by-step and uses one step to steer each level of the chain (although the states of all chains at the same level can be steered simultaneously). Since the longest chain has length n, + 2, this is the number of steps that will be needed.</p><p>Although this method works perfectly well, and the magnitudes of the sinusoids are simple to solve for, the algorithms can be tedious in practice because of the many steps that are needed. The trajectories that are generated consist of many segments and do not always follow a very direct path between the start and goal.</p><p>Therefore, an "all-at-once'' sinusoids method, which is an extension of that detailed in [ 191 for the two input single chain case, is proposed here. This method required only one step, and all of the necessary frequencies are applied simultaneously to the inputs uo =a0 + crsin wt u1 =PO + ~1 cos w t + . . . + ,&amp;,+I cos (nl + 1)wt um = vo + vl cos wt + ' . . + vnn+1 cos (n, + 1)wt.</p><p>The input parameters are found in the same manner as in the other methods: the chained form equations are integrated symbolically, evaluated at time T, and the parameters are solved for as a function of the initial and final states.</p><p>The main drawback to this approach is that there will be some interference between the levels (although not between chains) and solving for the input parameters will require solving nonlinear algebraic equations. In the simple cases that we have explored, this has not been a problem for a symbolic mathematical software package.</p><p>When this method is implemented on a multisteering trailer system, the first input, which always goes through one period, will transform back to the driving input, which will usually change direction (at least one back-up). This seems to work well when parallel-parking type maneuvers are desired. The free parameter Q can be adjusted to change the distance that the trailer system drives forward before it backs up.</p></div>

Stabilization for Multiinput Chained Forin Systems</head><p>Chained form systems are open-loop controllable, as shown above by the various point-to-point steering algorithms, but are not stabilizable by pure smooth static-state feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Bearing this result in mind, various researchers have tied to stabilize such systems by time-varying or nonsmooth state feedback.</p><p>Many of the algorithms for point stabilization require the system to be in chained form. For two-input systems, a class of smooth, time-varying control laws for local and global asymptotic stabilization to a point was given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This procedure was extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> to locally asymptotically stabilizing the origin of (m + 1)-input, m-chain, single-generator chained form systems. This method consists of taking the The five-axle, two-steering system showing the virtual exhension which is added in front of the second steering wheel. Such a system could be chained form system and converting it into power form, which is diffeomorphic to chained form. The control laws, which are time-varying functions of the state, will stabilize the system in power fom.</p><p>Many of the other results which have been presented in the literature for two-input chained form systems could also be extended to multiinput single-generator chained form systems in a straightforward manner. kinematics of the second steering axle 6': are thus altered: it is no longer steered directly, but through the virtual steering wheel.</p><p>The bottoms of the chains in the multiinput chained form are the ( 5 , y) coordinates of the rear axle and the hitch angle &amp;, and the rest of the coordinates are found through mfferentiation according to (5),</p><p>To illustrate the procedure presented in this paper for converting multisteering trailer systems into chained form, the algorithms given in Section ID will be followed for two example systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Fire Truck</head><p>Although the fire truck example has been examined extensively in previous work, it can also be considered in terms of the algorithms described in this paper, and in fact, the formulation is somewhat different than in [4]. In that paper, the bottoms of the chains in the multiinput chained form were chosen to be the (5, y) position of the passive axle along with the angle of the trailer (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7</ref>). Because of the relative simplicity of the three-axle system, that choice allowed kinematic equations to be put into multiinput chained form without using dynamic state feedback. The fire truck fits into the class of multisteering trailer systems, thus the kinematic equations can also be converted into multiinput chained form using a virtual extension (and a different choice of states at the bottoms of the chains). Although this extension is not necessary for this particular system, no systematic procedure is known for transforming a general multisteering trailer system into multiinput chained form without using the sort of virtual extension that is proposed in this paper.</p><p>The kinematic equations for the fire truck can be obtained from (3) and will not be repeated here.</p><p>The system has two steering trains, the first has length two and the second has length one. Since there is one passive axle in front of the second steering train, this train will be augmented by the addition of one virtual axle as described in Section III-C. The angle of this virtual axle is denoted 0;. A sketch of the extended system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7</ref>. The 22" 6 y (the chains are written upside down here to show the order in which the coordinates are calculated: starting at the bottom). The resulting equations are in multichained form.</p></div>

The system consists of two steering trains, the first has length two and the second has length three.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. A Parallel-Parking Trajectory</head><p>Once the kinematic equations are in multiinput chained form, the system can be steered by one of the algorithms discussed in Section IV. As an illustration, consider the parallel parking maneuver shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> for the five-axle, two-steering system described in Section V-B. The system parameters have been chosen as n = 3 (three passive axles), m = 2 (two steering wheels), and the lengths of the hitches as Li = Lg = Li = 5, and Li = 3.</p><p>Polynomial inputs in the chained form equations are used to steer the system from an initial point of (2, y) = (0, 20) to a final point of (z, y) = (0, 0), where (z, y) are the coordinates of the midpoint of the last axle. All of the body angles are aligned with the horizontal axis in both the initial and final configurations.</p><p>As noted in Section IV-A, polynomial inputs are not immediately suited to this type of trajectory since the time needed to steer the system, computed from (25), would come out to be zero and the algorithm would fail. Therefore the trajectory was planned in two steps, choosing an intermediate point (z, y) = (30, 10). The virtual angles were chosen equal to zero in both the initial and final states, and the virtual hitch length was chosen as L: = 1. The procedure is first to transform the initial and final states into the chained form coordinates. Then, using the polynomial inputs methods discussed in Section IV-A, the chained form inputs needed to steer the system are found. These inputs can then be transformed back to the original coordinates to find the virtual inputs, and the real inputs can finally be calculated using the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</p><p>The simulation was performed on the system in the chained form coordinates, then the inverse coordinate transformation was used on the simulation data to obtain the trajectory in the original coordinates.
