<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, the study of switched systems has received growing attention. Switched systems are a class of hybrid dynamical systems consisting of a family of continuous-(or discrete-) time subsystems, and a rule that orchestrates the switching between them [1]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. A survey of basic problems in stability and design of switched systems has been proposed recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Among the large variety of problems encountered in practice, one can study the existence of a switching rule that ensures stability of the switched system. One can also assume that the switching sequence is not known a priori and look for stability results under arbitrary switching sequences. One can also consider some useful class of switching sequences (see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and the references therein).</p><p>In this note, we are interested in stability analysis and control synthesis of switched systems under arbitrary switching sequences. The approach followed in this note looks at the existence of a switched quadratic Lyapunov function to check asymptotic stability of the switched system under consideration. To evaluate the interest of this approach for control design problems, we concentrate on the output feedback design problem. By output feedback, we mean the design of output feedback gains for each subsystem such that the closed-loop switched system is asymptotically stable. The results proposed in this note can be considered as a tradeoff between highly conservative results (those using a single quadratic Lyapunov function) and less conservative but numerically hard to check ones. This note is organized as follows. In Section II, we give the problem formulation. Section III is dedicated to stability analysis of switched systems by mean of a switched quadratic Lyapunov function. In Section IV, switched static output feedback control design is investigated. A numerical evaluation is given in Section V.</p></div>

PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>We consider the class of switched hybrid systems given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x k+1 =Ax k + Bu k y k =C x k (1)</formula><p>where x k 2 n is the state, u k 2 m is the control input, and y k 2 p H 1 : matrix C is of full row rank; H 2 : the switching rule in not known a priori, but we assume that its instantaneous value is available in real time.</p><p>Assumption H1 does not impose any loss of generality since it can be achieved by discarding redundant measurement components of the output y k . Assumption H 2 corresponds to practical implementations where the switched system is supervised by a discrete-event system and the discrete state value is available in real time. Here, we are interested in stability analysis and control synthesis problems for this class of switched systems. By stability analysis, we mean stability analysis of the origin for the autonomous switched system.

STATIC OUTPUT FEEDBACK DESIGN</head><p>Consider the synthesis of a switched static output feedback</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">u k = Ky k (12)</formula><p>ensuring stability of the closed-loop switched system (3).

The problem of solving numerically ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">13</ref>) or ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) for (P i , K i ) or (S i , G i , K i ), respectively, is nonconvex in general. This makes the problem of output feedback a very difficult one. A sufficient condition is given in the following theorems. These conditions have the advantage of being convex and are numerically well tractable. Theorem 3: If there exist symmetric matrices Si , matrices Ui and V i (8 I 2 I) such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">8 (i; j ) 2 I 2 I Si (AiSi + Bi Ui Ci) T Ai Si + Bi Ui Ci Sj &gt; 0<label>(15)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">V i C i = C i S i 8 i 2 I (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">)</formula><p>then the output feedback given by (2) with</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">K i = U i V 01 i 8 i 2 I (17)</formula><p>stabilizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Proof: Assume that there exist Si , Ui , and Vi such that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">16</ref>) are satisfied. As C i is of full-row rank and S i is positive definite, it follows from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">16</ref>) that V i is of full rank for all i = 1; . . . ; N and then invertible. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">16</ref>) and (17), we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">U i C i = K i C i S i 8 i 2 I:</formula><p>Replacing Ui Ci in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">15</ref>) by Ki CiSi and applying the Schur complement formula one gets 8 (i; j ) 2 I 2 I S 01 i 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">(A i + B i K i C i ) T S 01 j (A i + B i K i C i ) &gt; 0:</formula><p>Letting Pi = S 01 i and Pj = S 01 j and using the Schur complement formula, the latest inequality is nothing than the stability condition (8) applied to the closed-loop system (3).

Hence, matrices V i satisfying (19) are nonsingular. Following similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 3 we find that satisfying conditions of Theorem 4 leads to</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">8 (i; j) 2 I 2 I G i + G T i 0 S i G T i (A i + B i K i C i ) T (A i + B i K i C i )G i S j &gt; 0 (21)</formula><p>which is nothing than ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) applied to the closed system (3). Hence, by Theorem 2, the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. The previous theorems deserve some comments. Theorems 3 and 4 state how to determine a stabilizing switched output feedback control solving a convex problem. In Theorem 3, the Lyapunov matrices P i (8 i 2 I) are constrained to satisfy the equality constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. In Theorem 4, the Lyapunov matrices Pi = S 01 i (8 i 2 I) have to satisfy the stability condition only. The equality constraint is reported on the slack variables G i (19). Hence, the equivalence between condi- tions given in Theorems 3 and 4 fails. As it is shown in the numerical evaluation, reporting the equality constraint on the slack variables Gi makes the conditions of Theorem (4) less conservative than those given in Theorem 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, evaluation is proposed. Recall that our switched system is characterized by: the number of modes (N ), the system order (n), the number of inputs (m) and number of outputs (p). For fixed values of (N , n, m, p), we generate randomly 100 switched systems of the form (1). For each switched system, we try to compute a stabilizing output feedback control using three methods</p><p>• Method 1 uses constant Lyapunov functions (CLF) V (x k ) = x T k P x k . This corresponds to conditions in Theorem 3 with 8 (i; j ) 2 I 2 I, S i = S j = S a constant matrix.</p><p>• Method 2 uses the conditions given in Theorem 3.</p><p>• Method 3 uses the conditions given in Theorem 4.</p><p>To each method we associate a counter (SuccessCLF, SuccessTh3, and SuccessTh4) which is increased if the corresponding method succeeds in providing an output feedback stabilizing control. The difficulty in performing this evaluation is to generate switched systems for which a static output feedback control is known to exist. Generating dynamical matrices A 1 ; . . . ; A N stable, in the discrete time LTI sense, allows to have more chance to succeed. To check the feasibility of the LMI conditions, the LMI control toolbox for Matlab 5.3 has been used. The results of this evaluation are given in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. One can see that static feedback synthesis conditions given in Theorem 4 reduce significantly the conservatism. This shows the advantage in using the slack variable Gi to satisfy the constraint (19). Notice that the number of randomly generated systems that can not be stabilized by static output feedback grows as the number of modes and the system order increase. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this note, a switched Lyapunov function approach is proposed for stability analysis and control synthesis for switched systems. Motivated by recent results developed for polytopic time varying uncertain systems, a condition has been proposed for stability analysis of switched systems. Even if this condition has been proved to be equivalent to a classical one, it is shown to be less conservative when constrained control design problems are investigated. The difficult problem related to switched-static output-feedback design has been addressed to illustrate such a conservatism reduction. As the proposed conditions are LMI based conditions, they can be easily extended to other control problems (Decentralized control, H1 control, etc.). Moreover, the results presented in this note can be easily applied to the class of piecewise affine and hybrid systems considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> leading to less conservative results for constrained control problems. Finally, the proof technique used in this note holds also when the set of system matrices is infinite. One can take any picewise constant time function within a certain polytope and verify the conditions at edges of the polytope.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shlomo Engelberg</head><p>Abstract-We consider comparator-based nonlinear feedback systems, and use Tsypkin's method to develop a strategy with which to find systems with low-pass linear part for which the describing function technique erroneously predicts limit cycles. We produce an infinite set of examples of systems with very low-pass linear parts for which the describing function technique predicts spurious limit cycles, and also provide a more practical example in which limit cycles are erroneously predicted. Index Terms-Describing functions, limit cycles, Tsypkin's method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Consider a nonlinear feedback circuit which consists of a comparator and a linear element (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>). One way to check for limit cycles is to use the describing function method. This is an approximate method-it  is generally assumed to work well when the system under consideration has low-pass linear part, G(s). We produce examples of systems that are as low pass as one could desire but for which the describing function method predicts spurious limit cycles. We make use of a form of the Tsypkin locus analysis in order to determine the types of systems for which the describing function technique does not work properly.</p><p>Let G(j!) be the frequency response of the linear part of the system and let D(M) be the describing function of the nonlinear element. We show that when the nonlinear elements is a comparator then if G(j!) is tangent, or nearly tangent, to 01=D(M), then the describing function technique erroneously predicts a limit cycle, and we show how to quantify the term "nearly tangent." We provide two infinite sets of examples for which the describing function erroneously predicts limit cycles. We also consider a more practical example in detail.</p><p>The general result that we describe-that the near tangency of the graphs of G(j!) and 01=D(M) can lead the describing function technique to erroneously predict limit cycles-has been remarked upon previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[5, p. 186</ref>]. We prove that the phenomenon exists in the case of a comparator nonlinearity, and we show how to quantify the phrase "nearly tangent" using exact methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE DESCRIBING FUNCTION ANALYSIS</head><p>The describing function of a comparator is D(M) = 4=(M ). For a limit cycle to occur in the circuit of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, the describing function technique requires a frequency for which 0G(j!)D(M) = 1-a frequency for which the total gain "seen" by the limit cycle is one. This condition can be formulated as G(j!) = 0 M 4 :</p><p>Graphically, this condition can be expressed as the necessity of an intersection of the graph of the frequency response and of the negative reciprocal of the describing function for some ! &gt; 0, M &gt; 0. We note that in the case at hand, the graph of 01=D(M), M &gt; 0 is the negative-real axis. We see that for a limit cycle to exist, the describing function method requires a positive frequency such that G(j!) is real and negative. One cannot conclude that this is a requirement for the existence of a limit cycle; the describing function analysis is only approximate. It is generally used for systems whose linear part has at least a double zero at infinity-for systems that are rather low pass.</p><p>In deriving the describing function technique, one assumes that the output of the system is well approximated by a pure sine wave. Thus, the output of the comparator-whose input is just the inverted output-is a square wave that is positive in one half period and negative in the next <ref type="bibr">[4, pp. 586-588]</ref>. In Section III, we see that in such cases there is an exact method for determining whether or not limit cycles exist.</p><p>We make use of the exact method to show that there exist an infinite set of examples with as many zeros at infinity as one desires for which the describing function method predicts the existence of a limit cycle when no limit cycle exists. 0018-9286/02$17.00 © 2002 IEEE</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>is the output vector. is a switching rule which takes its values in the finite set I = f1; . . . ; Ng.
