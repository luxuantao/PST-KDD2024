<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The problem of multiple criteria optimization has been studied for many years, and the models of multiple criteria optimization have found their way into many diverse applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The standard approach starts with an assumption that the criteria are incomparable, i.e. having no basis of comparison. However, there are many applications in which the criteria express ideas of allocation of resources and try to achieve some equitable allocation of resources. The main focus of the current paper is solving this foundational problem for the case of linear multiple criteria optimization.</p><p>We are motivated by general resource allocation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which have a natural requirement for equitable outcomes. Such problems, prevalent among problems of allocation of resources with respect to many criteria have not been handled in a satisfactory way in the literature. Typically, only minimax (maximin) approaches are studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> which ignore the rich mathematical structure of a variety of equitable solutions. Another class of applications, arise in location theory, in which the clients of a system are entitled to equitable treatment according to community regulations. In such problems, the decisions often concern the placement of a service center or other facility in a position so that the users are treated in an equitable way, relative to certain criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Another type of model is that of approximation of discrete data by a functional form. The residuals may be viewed as objectives to be minimized, and in the classical approach, there is no reason to treat them in any way but equitably.</p><p>Indeed, in approaches which seek to scalarize the multiple criteria, some effort is always placed in achieving some comparable functions (pseudocriteria) which are combined to form a final scalar objective function to be optimized. This is done in order to make the physical units of the pseudo-criteria uniform, so that they can be added or otherwise composed. This phase of the modeling discipline seldom questions the process or the consequences of such a uniformization.</p><p>One of the results of our research is to trace the consequences of this uniformization beyond the process of aggregation of functions for scalarization. We will show that there are many logical consequences of the assumption, or the provision, that all criteria are equitable.</p><p>Consider a decision problem defined as a linear optimization problem with uniform objective functions i i</p><p>. For simplification we assume, without loss of generality, that the objective functions are to be minimized. The problem can be formulated as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is an matrix (consisting of rows i ) representing the vectorfunction that maps the decision space n into the criterion space m , denotes the feasible set defined by a system of linear equations and inequalities, denotes the vector of decision variables.</p><p>We refer to the elements of the criterion space as achievement vectors. An achievement vector is attainable if it expresses outcomes of a feasible solution . The set of all the attainable achievement vectors is denoted by , i.e.</p><p>: for some . Model (1) only specifies that we are interested in minimization of all objective functions i for . In order to make it operational, one needs to assume some solution concept specifying what it means to minimize multiple objective functions. The solution concepts are defined by properties of the corresponding preference model. We assume that solution concepts depend only on evaluation of the achievement vectors while not taking into account any other solution properties not represented within the achievement vectors. Thus, we can limit our considerations to the preference model in the criterion space .</p><p>The preference model is completely characterized by the relation of weak preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, denoted hereafter with . Namely, the corresponding relations of strict preference and indifference are defined by the following formulas 0 00 0 00 00 0</p><p>(2) 0 00 0 00 00 0</p><p>The preference model related to the standard Pareto-optimal solution concept also assumes that the preference relation is reflexive.</p><p>(4) transitive 0 00 00 000 0 000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> and strictly monotonic</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where i denotes the -th unit vector in the criterion space. The last assumption expresses the fact that for each individual objective function less is better (minimization). The preference relations satisfying axioms (4-6) are called hereafter rational preference relations. The rational preference relations allow us to formalize the Pareto-optimal solution concept with the following definitions.</p><p>DEFINITION 1.1: We say that achievement vector 0 rationally dominates 00 , or 00 is rationally dominated by 0 , iff 0 00 for all rational preference relations .</p><p>DEFINITION 1.2: We say that achievement vector is rationally nondominated, iff there does not exist 0 such that 0 rationally dominates .</p><p>DEFINITION 1.3: We say that feasible solution is an efficient or Pareto-optimal solution of the multiple criteria problem (1), iff is rationally nondominated.</p><p>Similar to the relation of rational dominance, we can define the relation of rational indifference (indifference for all rational preference relations) and the relation of rational weak dominance (weak preference for all rational preference relations). The relations of rational dominance r , indifference r and weak dominance r satisfy conditions (2-3). So, they define the preference relation r . Moreover, relation r has properties of reflexivity (4), transitivity (5) and strict monotonicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, thus it is a rational preference relation. Relation r is the most general rational preference relation and each rational preference relation is consistent with it in the sense that 0 r 00 0 00</p><p>Therefore, an achievement vector 0 is rationally nondominated, if and only if, there exists a rational preference relation such that 0 for any . The rational dominance relation r may be expressed in terms of vector inequality , where 0 00 0 i 00 i 0 00 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 00 00 0 PROPOSITION 1.1: For any achievement vectors 0 , 00 0 r 00 0 00 0 r 00 0 00</p><p>As a consequence of Proposition 1.1 we can state that a feasible solution 0 is an efficient solution of the multiple criteria problem (1), if and only if, there does not exist such that 0 . The latter refers to the commonly used definition of the efficient solutions as feasible solutions for which one cannot improve any criterion without worsening another <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, the axiomatic definition of the rational preference relation allows us to introduce additional properties of the preferences related to the uniform criteria and their equity.</p><p>While dealing with uniform criteria, we assume that the preference model is impartial (anonymous, symmetric). In terms of the preference relation it may be written as the following axiom</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(1) (2) (m) 1 2 m (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>for any permutation of . The preference relations satisfying axioms ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">7</ref>) we will refer hereafter as impartial rational preference relations.</p><p>Further, according to the theory of equity measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the preference model should satisfy the (Pigou-Dalton) principle of transfers. The principle of transfers states that a transfer of small amount from an outcome to any relatively worse-off outcome results in a more preferred achievement vector. As property of the preference relation, the principle of transfers takes form of the following axiom</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">i i i i i i<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The preference relations satisfying all axioms (4)-(8) we will call hereafter equitable rational preference relations.</p><p>A requirement of impartiality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and the principle of transfers (8) complement the multiple criteria optimization axioms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Therefore, we can consider equitable multiple criteria optimization based on the preference model defined by axioms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. In this paper we develop the basic theory of the equitable multiple criteria linear optimization. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the formal definition of the equitable efficiency is given, and some fundamentals are presented. In Section 3, we develop and analyze generation techniques for equitably efficient solutions. Further, in Section 4 the structure of the equitably efficient set of the multiple criteria linear programs are developed and analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EQUITABLE EFFICIENCY</head><p>Consider the multiple criteria problem (1) with the preference model defined by equitable rational preference relations. The equitable rational preference relations allow us to define the concept of equitably efficient solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, similar to the standard efficient (Pareto-optimal) solution defined with the rational preference relations. DEFINITION 2.1: We say that achievement vector 0 equitably dominates</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>00</head><p>, or 00 is equitably dominated by 0 , iff 0 00 for all equitable rational preference relations .</p><p>DEFINITION 2.2: We say that achievement vector is equitably nondominated, iff there does not exist 0 such that 0 equitably dominates .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEFINITION 2.3: We say that feasible solution is an equitably efficient solution of the mutliple criteria problem (1), iff is equitably nondominated.</head><p>Similar to the relation of equitable dominance, we can define the relation of equitable indifference (indifference for all equitable rational preference relations) and the relation of equitable weak dominance (weak preference for all equitable rational preference relations). The relations of equitable dominance e , indifference e and weak dominance e satisfy conditions (2-3). So, they define the preference relation e . Moreover, relation e holds properties of reflexivity (4), transitivity (5), strict monotonicity (6), impartiality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and satisfies the principle of transfers ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">8</ref>), thus it is an equitable rational preference relation. Relation e is the most general equitable rational preference relation and each equitable rational preference relation is consistent with it in the sense that 0 e 00 0 00</p><p>In a similar way, one may introduce the relation of symmetric dominance as the preference for all impartial rational preference relations and define the concept of symmetrically efficient solution. This is equivalent to the concept of symmetry defined by comparisons of permutations of individual outcomes in the achievement vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The relation of symmetric dominance s can be expressed as vector inequality on the ordered achievement vectors. This can be mathematically formalized as follows: introduce the ordering map m m such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1 2 m</formula><p>, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1 2 m</formula><p>and there exists a permutation of set such that i (i) for . Note that due to impartiality axiom <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, 0 00 implies 0 s 00 . In fact <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, 0 s 00 0 00</p><p>Observe that the relation of equitable dominance e can be expressed as a vector inequality on the cumulative ordered achievement vectors.</p><p>Apply to ordered achievement vectors , a linear cumulative map </p><p>The coefficients of vector express, respectively: the largest outcome, the total of the two largest outcomes, the total of the three largest outcomes, etc.</p><p>Directly from the definition of the map , it follows that for any two achievement vectors 0 00 the following relations hold 0 00 0 00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> 0 00 0 00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> The reverse implication to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> is not valid. For instance, and simultaneously .</p><p>Note that the relation 0 00 0 00</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(12)</formula><p>is reflexive, transitive and impartial. Moreover, the following formulas hold 0 00 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 00 00 0</p><p>Thus the relation ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) is a preference relation with the relations of strict preference and indifference defined, respectively, as follows 0 00 0 00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> 0 00 0 00</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(14) Furthermore i and i i i i i i</formula><p>So, the relation ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) is an equitable rational preference relation. The relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> was extensively analyzed within the theory of majorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where it is called the relation of weak submajorization. The theory of majorization includes the result (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, 2.C.6, p. 28) which can be expressed in the following form. The following propositions and corollaries use this result to show the equivalence of the equitable dominance and the relation (12 , then 0 00 and, due to (10), 0 00 . Otherwise,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">k k01 i k01 i</formula><p>for at least one index . Thus there exists a finite sequence of vectors 0 00 1 t such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">k k01 k i k i , k k01 i k01 i</formula><p>for and 0 t .</p><p>PROPOSITION 2.3: For any two achievement vectors 0 00 0 e 00 0 00</p><p>Proof: The relation ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) is an equitable rational preference relation. Thus 0 e 00 0 00</p><p>In order to prove the reverse implication, notice that due to Proposition 2.2, for any equitable rational preference relation , 0 00 . Hence, due to impartiality of all equitable rational preference relations, 0 e 00 .  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</p><p>We emphasize to the reader the importance of this result, as it provides the relationship between equitable efficiency and Pareto-optimality. In what follows we will use Corollary 2.2 to derive properties of the equitably efficient set and to introduce generation techniques. COROLLARY 2.3: For any strictly increasing linear function , vector 0  is an equitably efficient solution of the multiple criteria problem (1), iff it is an equitably efficient solution of the problem Note that, according to Corollary 2.3, equitable efficiency is scale invariant with respect to linear scaling with a positive factor. This result is very important as such scale invariance is usually considered an axiom of equity measurement.</p><p>The equitable dominance relation may be illustrated with the so-called domination structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, i.e. a point-to-set map <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> For the standard rational dominance relation, the sets are independent of and they take the form of the nonnegative orthant. The domination structure of the equitable dominance depends on the location of an achievement vector relative to the absolute equity line ( 1 2 m ). In the general case, the set is not a cone and it is not convex. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows fixed at , i.e. the set . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref> gives the graphical illustration of the problem in the objective space 1 2 . However, due to the identity objective functions 1 1</p><p>and 2 2 , it can directly interpreted in the decision space ( 1 2 ). The standard efficient set consists of two line segments and , where , and . While taking into account symmetric dominance we eliminate segments and , where , and . Thus, the symmetric efficient set consists of three segments: , and . Note that the symmetric efficient set is not connected. Further, taking into account the equitable dominance we get the segment as the equitably efficient set. In Section 4, we will prove that the equitably efficient set is always connected.  i is strictly convex and symmetric. Hence</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">" s i i</formula><p>Thus, the preference relation corresponding to the minimization of satisfies (8) which completes the proof.</p><p>COROLLARY 3.1: For any strictly convex, increasing function , the optimal solution of the problem ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) is an equitably efficient solution of the multiple criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>Problem (19) corresponds to the study it is not very interesting as it introduces nonlinearity into the multiple criteria linear problem.</p><p>Note that Corollary 2.2 allows one to generate equitably efficient solutions of (1) as efficient solutions of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Scalarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, minimizing the sum of outcomes, corresponds to minimization of the last ( -th) objective in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Similar, the minimax scalarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> corresponds to minimization of the first objective in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Thus, in the case of bicriteria problems (</p><p>), the set of equitably efficient solutions is equal to the set of efficient solutions of the bicriteria problem with objectives defined as the maximum and the sum of the original two objectives. In general the following corollary is valid. then 0 is an equitably efficient solution of (1).</p><p>In the case of efficiency one may use the scalarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> with weighted objective functions to generate various efficient solutions. In fact, it provides a complete parametrization of the efficient set for multiple criteria linear programs. In the case of equitable multiple criteria programming one cannot assign various weights to individual objective functions, as that violates the requirement of impartiality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. However, due to Corollary 2.2, tthe weighting approach can be applied to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> resulting in the scalarization</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">m i=1 i i (21)</formula><p>note that, due to the definition of map with ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>), the can be expressed in the form with weights i m j=i j ( ) allocated to coefficients of the ordered achievement vector. Such an approach to multiple criteria optimization was introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> as Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA). When applying OWA to problem (1) we get  . Thus, due to Corollary 2.2, each optimal solution of ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) is an equitably efficient solution of (1).</p><p>Note that for weights i satisfying (23), for any permutation of the following inequality holds where denotes the set of all permutations of . In problem (24-27) the ordering replaced with ! linear inequalities (27). It generates a large number of constraints but all the inequalities (27) are defined by permutations of the single weights i . Therefore, the dual of (24-27) can be solved by the simplex method with the column generation technique applied to columns corresponding to (27).</p><p>Applying the lexicographic optimization to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> we get the lexicographic problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(28)</formula><p>where first 1 is minimized, next 2 and so on. Due to (9), problem (28) is equivalent to the problem (29) which represents the lexicographic minimax approach to the original multiple criteria problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Problem ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) is a regularization of the standard minimax scalarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, but in the former in addition to the largest outcome we minimize also the second largest outcome (provided that the largest one remains as small as possible), minimize the third largest (provided that the two largest remain as small as possible), and so on. The lexicographic minimax solution is known in the game theory as the nucleolus of a matrix game <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This approach has been recently used for linear programming problems related to multiperiod resource allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and for linear multiple criteria problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The lexicographic minimax problem (29) may be considered a limiting case of the OWA problem (22) when the differences among the weights increase to infinity. As the lexicographic optimization generates efficient solutions, thus due to Corollary 2.2, we get the following corollary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COROLLARY 3.3: The optimal solution of the lexicographic minimax problem (29) is an equitably efficient solution of the multiple criteria problem (1).</head><p>The lexicographic minimax solution is unique with respect to the ordered achievement vectors . It can be considered in some sense the "most equitable solution". Note that one wish to consider the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> as an equitable problem (with an equitable rational preference relation). In such a situation we should apply to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. It results in the problem with doubly cumulative ordered criteria which again may be considered as equitable. As the limit of such an approach we get the lexicographic minimax problem (29). One may wish to look for the "least equitable solution" applying reverse lexicographic minimization to the problem (15), i.e. solving the lexicographic problem m m01</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">1 (<label>30</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where first m is minimized, next m01</p><p>and so on. While the lexicographic minimax ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) is a refinement of the standard minimax approach (18), the problem (30) is a lexicographic refinement of the scalarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Note, that in the lexicographic optimization problem dividing objectives by constants does not affect the solution and i represents the mean of largest coefficients in the achievement vector . Therefore, we refer to problem (30) as the lexicographic mean problem. As the lexicographic optimization generates efficient solutions, from Corollary 2.2, we get the following corollary. COROLLARY 3.4: The optimal solution of the lexicographic mean problem (30) is an equitably efficient solution of the multiple criteria problem (1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">STRUCTURE OF EQUITABLY EFFICIENT SET</head><p>In Section 2 we established the equivalence between the equitably efficient solutions of (1) and the efficient solutions of problem (15) (compare Cor. 2.2). Now, we further use this result to explore the structure of the equitably efficient set. Note that the individual objective functions of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> are convex piecewise linear functions of . They can be written in the form i , and 3 denotes the optimal value of the minimax problem (37). Thus, there exists the optimal solution of the lexicographic minimax problem (29) which, due to Corollary 3.3, is an equitably efficient solution of the multiple criteria problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>The existence of the equitably efficient set and its relationship to the efficient set have been discussed. However, now we point out the fact that the equitably efficient set does not suffer from the difficulties of the symmetric efficient set (lack of connectivity, see Ex. 2.1) and it is therefore a more useful and convenient solution set, both from the theoretical and the practical points of view. Proof: The equitably efficient set of problem (1) is the same as the efficient set of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. From Proposition 4.1, the efficient solutions of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> are in one-to-one correspondence to the efficient solutions of (32-35). (32-35) is a linear multiple criteria optimization problem, its efficient set is a connected set <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>A very important result in multiple objective linear optimization is the association of efficient solutions with optimal solutions of the scalar weighting problem using positive weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The is the analogue for our equitably efficient solution set. It seems that such a result should thus play an important role in analysis of equitable efficiency. PROPOSITION 4.6: A feasible solution 0 is equitably efficient, if and only if, there exist strictly decreasing and positive weights i (i.e. weights satisfying (23)) such that 0 is an optimal solution of the corresponding OWA problem (22).</p><p>Proof: Sufficiency of the condition follows from Proposition 3.2. Thus we only need to show that for each equitably efficient solution 0 there exist strictly decreasing and positive weights i (i.e. weights satisfying (23)) such that 0 is an optimal solution of the corresponding OWA problem (22).</p><p>Due to Proposition 4.1, if 0 is an equitably efficient solution of (1), then 0 0 0 is an efficient solution of multiple criteria linear program (32-35). Thus, from the theory of multiple criteria linear optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, there exist positive weights i (</p><p>) such that . Moreover, weights i satisfy the requirement (23). Thus, there exist strictly decreasing and positive weights i such that 0 is an optimal solution of the corresponding OWA problem (22).</p><p>Recall that in Section 3 several generation techniques for obtaining equitably efficient solutions were derived. Since the equitably efficient set is a connected subset of the efficient set, it is of interest to additional results which could potentially provide an easy way to enter to enter the equitably efficient set as well as serve as an aid to locating the equitably efficient solutions within the efficient set. PROPOSITION 4.7: If there exists any efficient solution 0 of (1) with equal outcomes 1 0 2 0 m 0 , then it is an equitably efficient solution.</p><p>Proof: An efficient solution with equal outcomes is a lexicographic minimax solution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper a theoretical development of a new concept of solution of a linear mutliple criteria optimization problem is introduced. From a foundation of rational preference relations and several additional axioms one obtains the concept of equitable efficiency. By utilizing the results concerning the ordering of achievement vectors and several related ideas, it is possible to obtain a linear multiple criteria optimization problem which serves in a role. That is, by seeking efficient solutions of this new problem, we find equitably efficient solutions of the original problem. Utilizing this key result, some properties of the equitably efficient set are obtained. These include sufficient conditions for existence, connectivity of the equitably efficient set, and characterizations related to weighting problems. Some illustrative examples point to advantages of equitably efficient solutions, as well as to richness relative to their variety.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>j</head><label></label><figDesc>Composition of these two maps results in the cumulative ordering map 1 2m defined as , i.e.,</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We do not suggest equitable efficiency as a replacement for Paretooptimality. On the contrary, it seems to be a supplemental concept, which is rather highly dependent on the existing theory and thus it is actually quite accessible to those using the Pareto theory. There are several multiple criteria decision problems where the Pareto-optimal solution concept is not powerful enough and the equity of individual outcomes is an important issue. Uniform and equitable outcomes arise in many practical problems. We do suggest that the concept of equitable efficiency allows for a rigorous solution of such problems which are not handled in a satifactory way by general Pareto theory.</p></div>

From the following result, we can appreciate that the new concept is consistent with Pareto optimization, but is a refinement. The motivation for making such a refinement derives from the application setting, in general. However, due to the nature of Pareto optimization, it is also often desirable to narrow the solution set and considering equitably efficient points is a natural way to select solutions. PROPOSITION 4.2: Any equitably efficient solution is an efficient solution.</p><p>Proof: Let 0 be an equitable efficient solution. Suppose that 0 is not efficient in the Pareto-optimal sense. Then a feasible vector must exist such that the achievement vectors 0 0 and satisfy 0 . Thus 0 and 0 . Hence, equitably dominates 0 (Cor. 2.1), which contradicts the equitable efficiency of 0 As observed earlier, the domination structure ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) related to equitable efficiency is not necessarily a cone and may not be a convex set (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Thus questions of existence of equitably efficient solutions arise. The next results show that some naturally occurring sufficient conditions resolve this tissue. PROPOSITION 4.3: If and there exists 3 such that 3 e for all , then there exists an equitably efficient solution of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>Proof: Due to Proposition 2.3, 3 3 for all . Thus, 3  for any attainable achievement vector of the multiple criteria linear program (32-35), which is by Proposition 4.1 equivalent to the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Hence, there exists an efficient solution 0 of (32)-( <ref type="formula">35</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Due to Corollary 2.2, 0 is an equitably efficient solution of problem (1).</p></div>			</div>
