<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Motivated by advances in information technology, organizations are placing more emphasis on capitalizing on the increasing mass of knowledge that they accumulate during the course of their business. However, as noted by Stewart <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the attempt to put all corporate knowledge on one huge server in the style of the 18th-century French encyclopedists is doomed to fail. Instead, Stewart continued to assert, the real value of information systems is in connecting people to people so that they can share the expertise and knowledge that they have at the moment, given that the cutting edge is always changing. Studies into the information-seeking behavior of people working in information-intensive fields also show that people searching for information commonly explore personal communications before using formal sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, if technology is to foster the effective use of the whole range of knowledge in organizations, it must be able to support access to not only explicitly documented knowledge, but also, and most important, tacit knowledge held by individuals. By enhancing the visibility and traceability of such knowledge, technology can help catalyze collaboration and knowledge sharing among its holders, both within and among organizations. Moreover, the ability to quickly find information on people's expertise can play a critical role in fostering the formation and sustenance of virtual organizations or enterprises, communities of practice, expertise networks, and the like.</p><p>Recognition of the need to foster expertise sharing has spawned research efforts in, among others, the knowledge management and the computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) communities. Concepts such as expertise capitalization or leveraging, skill mining, competence management, intellectual capital management, expertise networks, knowledge-sharing systems, and so forth are being widely discussed. However, rarely do the discussions go beyond generic assessments and touch on concrete design and implementation challenges. Moreover, systems that support such processes are at a low level of development compared with that of systems that support access to documented information.</p><p>In this article, we investigate the expert-finding problem as well as the various design and development issues, and we present the solution that we are pursuing. We begin with a brief analysis of the expert-finding problem and a review of the previous works on expert-finding aids. Then, after contextualizing expert-finding aids in broader organizational information systems, we present the results of our domain analysis, which allows for a more concrete discussion of current shortcomings and possible solutions. Finally, we describe the approach that we adopted, followed by an outline of our future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PROBLEM ANALYSIS</head><p>A variety of practical scenarios of organizational situations that lead to expert seeking have been extensively presented in the literature (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). McDonald and Ackerman <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> also provided empirical insight into the intricate organizational, personal, and social processes involved in expert seeking. In our extensive survey of the knowledge management literature, we found widespread acceptance of the fact that an effective knowledge management solution should aim at making accessible not only knowledge that is contained in documents, but also knowledge in people's heads (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>). However, much remains to be understood about expert seeking so as to enable the development of effective automated aids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">What Prompts Expert Seeking: Information Need and Expertise Need</head><p>On the basis of interviews that we conducted with researchers at a major research institution and of extrapolation from observations in the relevant literature, we identified two main motives for seeking an expert: (a) as a source of information and (b) as someone who can perform a given organizational or social function. Although fuzzy and sometimes overlapping, this categorization proves useful in analyzing the goals of automated expert finders, as is discussed subsequently in this article.</p><p>People with the first motive may seek an expert as a source of information to complement or replace other sources, such as documents and databases, in various ways. The following five cases are just a few possible scenarios that entail seeking experts as information sources:</p><p>1. The need for access to nondocumented information: Not all information in organizations can be explicitly documented; much important information can only be transferred through apprenticeship, experience, and informal conversation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Documented sources cannot help in novel situations, solutions in progress, or situations that are too focused. In addition, in some cases the needed information is deliberately not made publicly available (in documents or on the Internet) for economic, social, and political reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>2. The need for specification: The information that users need to solve a problem is often not well specified and requires a dialogue with an expert as a way to precisely identify it. For example, so as to effectively retrieve information from a retrieval system, a user must be able to convert the problem into search statements. In the information retrieval literature, this conversion is referred to as a transition from the exploration phase to the formulation phase in the information search process <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. This transition is known to be a pivotal point that is also accompanied by an emotional drift of the seeker, from confusion, frustration, and doubt to clarity. Naturally, people resort to seeking experts to carry them through this drift painlessly.</p><p>3. A desire to leverage on others' expertise (group efficiency): Users often want to minimize the effort and time required to find a particular piece of information (especially because what is "lots of work" for the user is often "little work" for the expert). Leveraging also includes using experts as effective and reliable information filters through which the useful information can be selected from the huge mass of information available.</p><p>4. The need for interpretation: Users are often not interested in a piece of information per se but rather its situated (contextualized) interpretation or the implications that can be derived from it in the given situation. Moreover, the user may fail to understand the information even if he or she manages to find it from documents.</p><p>5. The need for socialization: Users may prefer the human dimension that is involved in asking an expert rather than interacting with documents and computers.</p><p>The second category of expert-seeking motives-the need for an expert who can perform a given function-is generally characterized by a more structured EXPERT-FINDING SYSTEMS 3 search than simply seeking experts as information sources. In these cases, the need is for someone who possesses a certain type of expertise required to play a role in a particular undertaking. This need occurs in cases in which either the expert's involvement in a given activity is required or a continued partnership between the seeker and the expert is intended. Hence, what is involved is more than just acquiring a piece of information. Following are a few such cases:</p><p>â¢ Seeking a consultant, an employee, or a contractor â¢ Seeking a collaborator, a team member, a community or committee member, or a journal or conference reviewer â¢ Seeking a speaker, a presenter, a researcher, a promoter, or an expert interviewee for media</p><p>We can also view the preceding two categories of expert-finding motives as related to information need and expertise need, respectively. In the former case, a user is required to specify his or her information need, whereas in the latter case, a more complex specification of expertise need, replete with qualitative and quantitative parameters, is involved. In other words, when an individual is seeking experts as sources of information, that person is mainly interested in the question "Who knows about topic X?" In contrast, when an individual is seeking experts who can perform an organizational function, that person is equally interested in other questions such as "How much (well) does Y know about topic X?" "What else does Y know?" "How does Y compare with others in his knowledge of X?" and so forth. Therefore, the search process for experts who are supposed to perform an organizational function is usually performed more carefully and in a more formalized manner than the search process for experts who are supposed to deliver information.</p><p>Often, drawing a sharp distinction between these two categories of motives is difficult because they may occur at the same time or because an information need may later evolve into an expertise need. For example, someone who served as a source of information may also be needed to act as an ultimate advisor in the correct interpretation of not only the piece of information, but also the consequences for the concrete problem of the information seeker. Nonetheless, as is shown subsequently in this article, studying these two categories separately seems to be useful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Internal Versus External Expert Seeking</head><p>In organizations, expert seeking (and, consequently, the benefits of finding an expert) can also be viewed from internal and external points of view. A number of reasons exist for wanting to know who knows what within an organization, including knowledge sharing, team forming, project launching, and the like. An organization also benefits if external entities can easily discern the expertise of its staff because this knowledge fosters collaboration, cross-organizational networking, a better image, and so forth. For example, many organizations can deliver efficient customer help services if the customers, or their contact points in the organization, can easily trace and direct their queries to the appropriate expert. Similarly, academic and research institutes want the industry, the public, and potential research sponsors and research collaborators to know about and make use of their staffs' expertise.</p><p>Lewis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> noted that most organizations consider expert-locating services necessary for external expert seeking only, and not for internal expert seeking. This viewpoint is probably based on the presumption that employees know internal experts well. However, on the basis of a survey, Lewis indicated that employees benefit from support for seeking experts within the organization, just as customers do. Internal expert location is more important (a) the larger an organization is, (b) the more geographically distributed it is, and (c) the less homogeneous the composition of its members is (e.g., strict division borders, very different knowledge backgrounds, different histories due to company mergers). All three factors impair informal contact, which so far is the major way of disseminating knowledge about others' expertise within an organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Automated Support: Traditional Approaches</head><p>Whatever their motives, expert seekers need a range of information regarding people's expertise. They need to know whether a person who can answer their queries or who meets their criteria exists, how extensive that person's knowledge or experience is, whether there are other persons who could serve the same purpose, how the person compares with others in the field, how the person can be accessed (contacted), and so forth. This need, in turn, calls for a mechanism that gathers and makes such information accessible. However, doing this manually is a time-consuming and laborious undertaking, which makes automated aids invaluable.</p><p>One way of providing automated assistance is to develop expert databases (i.e., knowledge directories, knowledge maps) by manually entering expertise data. Many organizations took this approach in the past. Microsoft's Skills Planning "und" Development, or SPUD, project <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; Hewlett-Packard's CONNEX knowledge management system (http://www.carrozza.com/atwork/connex/), and the SAGE Expert Finder (http://sage.fiu.edu/) are examples of this approach. Similarly, manual data entry is used in skills inventory systems such as SkillView (http://www.skillview.com/), which are common in the knowledge management and human resource management domains.</p><p>However, expert databases are known to have numerous shortcomings, including the following four:</p><p>1. Manually developing the databases is a labor-intensive and expensive task. 2. These databases usually depend on the willingness of experts to spend time initially providing a detailed description of their expertise.</p><p>3. Because of the continuous change in people's specific expertise and skills (especially organization-specific and environment-specific skills), most expert databases are quickly outdated. Updating expert databases manually is resource consuming for the organization and time consuming for the experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERT-FINDING SYSTEMS 5</head><p>4. On one hand, the expertise descriptions are usually incomplete and general. On the other hand, expert-related queries are very fine grained and specific, and replete with various qualitative requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Normally, identifying an individual's specific area of expertise requires a detailed analysis of his or her works, records of activity, and so forth. Personal Web pages, through which individuals provide information about themselves and their expertise, are also used in tracing people with needed expertise. Searching the Web or the organizational intranet by topic may lead us to such Web pages if the experts have taken their time to maintain up-to-date pages and if the Web pages contain the supplied key words. Although such pages appear to be better sources of information on experts than expert databases are, simply using search engines to trace an expert is not normally an effective approach. For instance, a search on a topic returns a large number of various resources, which makes the selection of personal Web pages a time-consuming task. Because the search process is general and based on simple key-word matching, it also may not always lead to the relevant experts. Moreover, it is entirely the user's task to extract and compile all the required data to conduct such analyses as identifying the best expert, determining the expert's accessibility, discovering his or her relation with other experts, and so forth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">AUTOMATIC EXPERT FINDERS</head><p>The shortcomings of the preceding approaches coupled with the availability of large electronic repositories of organizational and personal records led to the suggestion of more helpful systems known as expert finders or expert or expertise recommenders. These systems aim at mitigating the previously mentioned shortcomings by trying to automatically discover up-to-date expertise information from implicit or secondary sources instead of relying on experts and other human sources only, although experts and their proxies can still complement or refine the automatically generated expertise information.</p><p>Attempts to develop systems that exploit implicit evidence of expertise as a way to augment the process of finding the proper expert dates at least to the visionary work of Maron and his colleagues in 1986 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Their experimental system, called HelpNet, took requests for information and replied with names of people ranked by the probability that the individual will provide a satisfactory answer. This probability was computed by using probabilistic models of information retrieval that combine the estimation of people's expertise in answering a question on a topic with the probability that a given user would be satisfied with the response provided by the source. To do this, the system constructed (a) a profile by asking people to indicate their expertise by selecting from a list of topics and (b) a probability estimate of their ability to provide a satisfactory answer to questions on this topic. Maron and his colleagues envisioned such systems enabling the emergence of "a large, active and fruitful future network of informationally rich people providing help to one another."</p><p>The next notable system was the Expert/Expert-Locator (EEL; also called Bellcore Advisor or Who Knows; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>). This system took natural-language requests for technical help or advice and, using latent semantic indexing, returned pointers to nearby research groups. The system constructed an expertise index of research groups based on a representative collection of the technical documents that they produce. In a test using EEL <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, descriptions of individual experts' current projects were used as a query to compare how well the system predicted to which of the 480 Bellcore work groups an expert belonged.</p><p>ContactFinder <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> is an intelligent agent that monitors discussion groups and extracts contacts in certain areas. It then responds to postings in which questions are asked by providing referrals to relevant contacts. This system uses various heuristics both to extract contacts from e-mail messages and to identify the postings in which technical help is asked for. Mattox et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> developed an expert-finder system that uses MITRE Corporation's corporate intranet to locate relevant experts by identifying relationships between experts and documents.</p><p>Kautz and his group approached the expert-finding problem from a different perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Their work is based on the observation that expert finding is an inherently complex process. Hence, they postulated that the best way of finding an expert is through what is called referral chaining, whereby a seeker finds the needed expert through referral by colleagues. Schwartz and Wood <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> also tried to enable locating people with related interests or expertise by analyzing a graph-which they called the specialization subgraph-formed by e-mail communication patterns (rather than their contents). These researchers used a set of heuristic algorithms to uncover shared-interest relationships among people and to derive a list of people who shared a given interest.</p><p>Vivacqua <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> described an expert-finder agent that is reminiscent of the earlier ideas in Kautz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> in that it employs a personal agent that both profiles a user's expertise and searches for other experts when help is needed. This agent was developed for the Java programming domain. Yenta <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> is also an agentbased system that creates personal profiles of people's interests and uses interagent communication not only to find people who have interests close to those expressed in a query, but also to cluster people on the basis of their shared interests. Expertise Recommender (ER) by McDonald and Ackerman <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> is a system composed of components that implement the functionality and heuristics that they identified from their field study in a software development company <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. ER provides four major components-profiling supervisor, identification supervisor, selection supervisor, and interaction management-that maintain and manipulate expertise profiles. Some more-recent commercial knowledge management systems also provide features supporting expertise profiling and retrieval in organizations. For example, Agentware Knowledge Server from Autonomy (http://www.autonomy.com) includes a feature that identifies employees' areas of expertise on the basis of the documents that they access on and submit to the organizational intranet. Likewise, KnowledgeMail from Tacit Knowledge Systems, Inc. (http://www.tacit.com/) supports finding experts by building profiles of people's skills from their e-mail messages and other documents that they submit. AskMe Enterprise is a similar product (http://www.askmecorp.com). Also noteworthy are organizational memory systems such as Answer Garden <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the Chicago Information Exchange system <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and Organik, by Orbital Software (now a module in Accolade Â® by Sopheon; http://www. sopheon.com/), all of which include expert-finding components. These systems are basically question-answering and routing systems that respond to requests for technical help by retrieving stored question-and-answer pairs, but they also provide facilities to route unanswered questions to a defined group of experts. Similar to such systems are works that incorporate expert-finding capabilities as part of peer help systems in education and training environments. PHelpS <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> is one such system that enables finding peer helpers among course participants or task-specific groups.</p><p>Other systems also consider people's World Wide Web browsing patterns as indicators of expertise. The MEMOIR system <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> enables a person to find experts in a certain domain on the basis of a log database called trailbase, which consists of URLs that people visited and key words for these pages. Likewise, the Expert Browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> enables people in organizations to use logged and indexed browse paths of experts to find relevant documents. (However, the authors describe only the features that require the user to know the expert or his or her group a priori). In general, as regards such systems, their basic assumptions may be questioned on the grounds that browsing just shows someone's interest rather than expertise.</p><p>Although no implementation is provided, a few authors have also tried to formulate techniques that enable finding experts by mining organizational and personal document repositories. Kimbrough and Oliver <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> suggested a retrieval method called associative retrieval, which uses binary term weight-matrix-based procedures called DCB algorithms to identify in organizations the resources (including people) that are closely linked to a given documented issue. Kanfer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> presented the idea of an agent called the know-who agent, which can use term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting to trace relevant experts according to the e-mails that they receive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">POSITIONING AUTOMATIC EXPERT FINDERS</head><p>Before proceeding to the domain analysis, in which we consider the functionality of expert finders, we survey the potential application contexts for these systems, with particular reference to other related organizational systems and services. This survey outlines the bounds of the expert finders' domain and crudely represents the context analysis phase required prior to domain analysis.</p><p>In an organizational information system, expert finders can either stand on their own or form part of other broader systems in the organization (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We believe that their great potential is unleashed only when they are used in integration with other organizational information systems-namely, knowledge management systems, recommender systems, computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) systems, and electronic markets for human expertise.</p><p>As mentioned previously, expert-finding capabilities form an important part of knowledge management systems whose aim is to provide access to knowledge in all forms, including knowledge held by people. Davenport <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> called this the "hybrid approach to knowledge management." Kautz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> also discussed the importance of integrating both the "ask a program or document" paradigm and the "ask a person" paradigm into information seeking. These two approaches are mostly used interdependently (i.e., one is used to find the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). Organizational memory systems such as question-answering and -routing systems (e.g., Answer Garden <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>) can be cited as one realization of this paradigm that necessarily call for expert-finding capabilities.</p><p>The services provided by social-recommender/collaborative-filtering systems can also be enhanced if expert-finding support is integrated into these systems. For example, as HÃ¶Ã¶k et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> noted, a user of a social-recommender/ collaborative-filtering system might be much more interested in what particular experts regard as important information than in the recommendation from a large peer group. It can reasonably be conjectured that users may want to judge the relevance of a piece of information on the basis of its quality (as reflected in the recommender's expertise) in addition to the quantity (the number) of people recommending it. Expert finders can play important roles in this case. For example, their integration allows users to inquire about the extent of recommenders' expertise or enables the recommender systems to factor the recommenders' expertise into their weighting schemes.</p><p>The systems that fall under the rubric of CSCW systems support collaboration of individuals who know of one another. Expert-finding components can also be integrated into these systems so that individuals not knowing with whom they should collaborate can identify the appropriate persons <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. With expert-finding capabilities as a core, so-called electronic markets for expertise or human competencies, wherein expertise sellers and buyers transact, were suggested by Lang and Pigneur <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Moukas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> proposed a software agent-based infrastructure that allows such transactions to occur. Booming services such as Keen Â® (www.keen.com) and www.askanexpert.com that allow users to post their questions and obtain quick expert answers for pay are other examples of such a market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DOMAIN ANALYSIS</head><p>Domain analysis is a method for analyzing a software application domain by studying and characterizing existing systems, emerging technologies, and development histories within a domain of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In domain analysis, common characteristics from similar systems are generalized, objects and operations that are common to all systems within the same domain and that vary from system to system are identified, and a domain model is defined to describe their relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. For our purpose, we used the analysis method based on faceted classification suggested in Prieto-Diaz <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and later improved by Birk <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Before proceeding, let us state that our aim in this article is far less ambitious than conducting a full-fledged domain analysis of expert-finding systems (for which we concur that the expert-finding domain is not mature enough) as is done in software reuse efforts, for which the approach is mainly employed. Instead, our aims are (a) to devise a systematic and structured way to characterize expertfinding systems and (b) to investigate whether better systems that can be used in a variety of contexts can be designed. We analyze the literature of five expertfinder systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to identify and define the feature space of the domain, and we map both implemented and potentially applicable technology to develop an intuitive domain model. Along the way, we also introduce terminology and structures that summarize the common and distinct characteristics of these systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Intuitive Domain Model</head><p>According to Birk <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, an intuitive domain model is a faceted classification scheme that summarizes findings of a domain analysis and describes the domain by using terms from the language of software professionals. Each facet in the domain model is represented by a domain factor (attribute shared by systems). Each domain factor is defined through a set of discrete values (possible values). A facet of a concrete domain is characterized through one or more values (actual values) from the set of possible values. A domain factor together with its actual value(s) is called a domain characteristic. For the expert-finding-systems domain, we identified seven facets or domain factors, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Each column represents one facet or domain factor and its possible values, which are possible implementations of the respective domain factor. Hence, we can classify a given expert-finding system by using its domain characteristics, which consist of the domain factors along with their values.</p><p>In the following discussion of the seven domain factors, we use the term expertise indicator to refer to the data gathered as evidence of expertise and input into an analysis process used to generate or infer people's expertise. By expertise indicator source, we refer to any source of expertise evidence that includes different types of documents, databases, individuals, and so forth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Basis for Expertise Recognition.</head><p>Expert-finding systems use various evidences as indicators of expertise. In general, these evidences can be grouped as explicit and implicit. Although explicit evidences are helpful when available, the focus of automatic expert finders is on using implicit evidences because they are usually far more common and do not impose burdens on the experts. Some of the implicit evidences considered as indicators of expertise are document authorship (formal and informal, individually or in a group), name occurrence in documents authored by other people, use of information sources or system functionality, queries sent to an information retrieval system, and the departments that the expert works in and the projects that he or she works on.</p><p>In theory, all documents in an organization are potential sources of expertise evidence because they are created by or about someone. However, for various reasons, such as computational difficulty, privacy, and coverage, not all sources can be used. Hence, expert-finding systems must employ a procedure for recognizing and gathering potential sources of expertise indicators. We refer to this mechanism as source recognition logic. This mechanism can be static in that the system mines a predefined type or format of sources, or it may be designed to dynamically identify sources of expertise information from the large mass and variety of electronic and human resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Expertise Indicator Extraction.</head><p>Once the sources are identified and gathered, expertise indicators are extracted from them. The expertise indicator extraction techniques that are applied to the aforementioned resources can be grouped as domain knowledge independent or domain knowledge driven. An example of the latter is described in Vivacqua <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, in which Java documentation was used as a domain knowledge base from which indicators of Java programming expertise were extracted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Expertise Models.</head><p>We use the phrase expertise model to refer to a metadescription of an individual's expertise, skills, and the like or to a link to an expert from an independently maintained organized structure of such descriptions. Being an inferred model, it differs, for example, from a record in an expertise database in that it involves a degree of uncertainty about how well it matches the actual expertise of people. Similarly, we use the phrase expertise modeling to refer to the process of generating the expertise model through an analysis of the expertise indicators, including possible inferences on the basis of the findings. Hence, a degree of uncertainty always exists about how well the expertise model matches people's actual expertise. An expert model (profile) refers to all information peculiar to an individual expert, including personal details, his or her expertise model (or links to one), his or her relations with other experts, and so forth.</p><p>Expertise models can be dynamically generated at query time from expertise indicator sources or extracted and stored either by personal agents or as aggregated models to which experts are associated. In query time-generated models, source databases are searched by employing information retrieval systems, and the matching sources are mined for experts and expertise indicators (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). In personal agent-based systems, expertise modeling is distributed to self-managing agents that belong to each expert and reside on his or her machine. As such, the whole system becomes a multiagent system composed of personal agents, which carry out the dual tasks of modeling expertise (from authored documents and other sources) and assisting their owners in searching for other experts. These agents can be endowed with mobility as well as autonomy to do all the processing and control of expertise modeling on their own. In the approach in which experts are associated with aggregated expertise models, experts are linked to a preconstructed or dynamically generated central representation of expertise that can be a kind of knowledge model (ontology), organizational structure, and so forth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4">Query Mechanisms.</head><p>Either the system can require the user to explicitly ask it for experts, or it may infer expertise need from users' communications, activities, errors, help-seeking actions, and so forth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.5">Matching Operations.</head><p>As a way to identify experts, information or expertise needs are matched with expertise models or expert profiles by using retrieval techniques including exact key-word matching or similarity matching such as vector space-based methods. Furthermore, some inference mechanisms can be applied to either or both queries and expertise models. This application allows such inferences as "If X is an expert on topic Y, then she may also/not know topic Z" or "If X knows topic Y, then she may know someone who is an expert on topic Z."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.6">Output Presentation.</head><p>Expert-finding systems may present their outputs with a varying degree of detail and functionality for further exploitation. As in information retrieval systems, some mechanism of ranking the identified experts (which we call expert differentiation) is applied. The ranking of experts may be multidimensional in that various criteria must be taken into account. Apart from relevant details about each returned expert, the organizational and social context and network of the experts can be employed. Some systems also provide the sources in which experts are mentioned, leaving the task of identifying the experts in them to the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.7">Adaptation and Learning Operations.</head><p>Adaptation and learning operations enable output customization by identifying users' preferences and domain knowledge as well as by gathering user feedback (both positive and negative) to the system's output. The system should be able not only to identify the people with required expertise, but also to identify the most suitable persons meeting the user's needs and context. For instance, the system can employ user models EXPERT-FINDING SYSTEMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> (including expertise models) to compare the experts' competence levels with that of the user, make user-tailored rankings, and attempt to describe expertise at a level of granularity that matches what is required by the queries (if an ontology is used). User feedback on the system's accuracy, ranking scheme, and so forth can be gathered and used to refine the expertise and expert models. Because expertise is in part a social construct, the system can also gather expertise evaluations and ratings from users and incorporate them into its expert-differentiation scheme. Users can also be allowed to bring new experts into the system. This facet was implemented in only a few of the systems that we studied. For instance, in Vivacqua <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, an expert profile of users was implemented to enable expertise-level matching. Likewise, Mattox et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> mentioned their plan to enable their system to learn with time on the basis of the results of each query to the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Discussion</head><p>In this subsection, we relate the expert-finding problem as discussed at the beginning of this article to the solution space that we reviewed and analyzed. We also describe the gaps that came to light during this process.</p><p>As we saw in the problem analysis, a user turns to an expert as a source of information, as a candidate for a given organizational role, or as a mixture of both. Each of these purposes imposes its own requirements on the system functionality. As noted previously, a user with an information need tends to seek experts before documents. The reasons for this tendency include using the experts as filters (guides) to documents, avoiding having to search for documents, or the user's being interested in the situated interpretation and application of a piece of information rather than in the mere information itself. Such needs imply a role for expert finders in giving the user expert-oriented access to the information space. Given a certain information space, an expert-finding system must then enable the user to find the appropriate expert who can be used as a gateway to, or in lieu of, the information space. This requirement justifies the approach of mining the information space as an implicit source of expertise indicators, as we saw in the domain analysis.</p><p>Even for the users who seek experts because they believe that the information is not documented, an expert finder that mines the information space can be useful. First, it can confirm the results of information retrieval systems that indicate that the information is not documented. Second, it can be used to trace persons who work in the problem domain at hand. However, to help the user find an expert on something that is not documented, the expert finder must use other means, beyond the organizational information resources, for determining expertise.</p><p>The fact that users need experts as information sources also substantiates the claim that expert-finding systems need to be deployed in complement to, and as part of, knowledge management, information retrieval, CSCW, collaborative filtering, and related services. Furthermore, because expert seeking arises during day-to-day work, it is beneficial if expert-finding systems are embedded in the day-to-day problem-solving and information search environments.</p><p>Users seeking experts who can perform a particular organizational function need more than just information. These users focus mainly on evaluating and comparing the expertise of people. In view of McDonald and Ackerman's <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> dichotomy of expert finding into two phases-expertise identification and expertise selection-these users need more support for the latter phase than that required by those who are seeking experts as information sources. However, in the works we analyzed, only expertise identification was targeted.</p><p>Specifically, while mapping the domain model to the expert-finding problem, we identified four gaps: (a) a source heterogeneity gap, (b) a technique optimality gap, (c) an expertise analysis support gap, and (d) a reusability, interoperability, and extensibility gap. In the following subsections, we describe each of these shortcomings and suggest some ways to address them. This discussion also forms the foundation for the approach that we present in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Source Heterogeneity Gap.</head><p>To adequately exploit the information space as a source of expertise indicators, expert finders need to handle the heterogeneity and distributedness of the information space. This need is also reflected by the wide variety of expertise indicator sources observed in the domain analysis. However, so far, each of the current systems exploits only a few types of mostly centralized sources. Hence, architectures that are flexible enough to address this problem are needed.</p><p>A number of dimensions of heterogeneity and distributedness can be identified. One aspect of heterogeneity that needs to be addressed is the heterogeneity of sources in reflecting expertise. How well expertise indicators such as terms and phrases reflect expertise is mainly a factor of how the source in which these indicators occur relates to the expert, irrespective of the indicators' direct statistical (or otherwise) correlation with the expert. For example, the occurrence of the term software agents in Dr. X's resume and its occurrence in one of his or her publications may not weigh the same. Moreover, the occurrence of this term in the title of a document shows a different distance to his or her actual expertise compared with its occurrence anywhere in the document body. Therefore, expert finders need to determine how a document relates to an expert before going on to extract expertise indicators from it.</p><p>Another aspect of heterogeneity of sources that is important in expertise recognition arises from their differing provenance. The sources include a range of organizational resources, personal information resources of experts, and the experts themselves. This diversity calls not only for functionality that specializes in monitoring each of these sources, but also for mechanisms to calibrate their differing ability to indicate expertise.</p><p>Much remains to be done in addressing the common situation in which expertise indicators are physically distributed across the organization and stored in various formats (databases, document repositories, Web sites, and the like). Furthermore, exploiting personal information resources brings in a range of privacy issues. Unlike the traditional expert database approach in which experts actively supply all information that will be accessible to the outside for evaluation, in this case all available information about the expert will be evaluated by default, unless the expert is allowed to actively block certain pieces of information from being scanned and evaluated. This situation calls for the need to enable experts to guide and control the system in monitoring their personal sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERT-FINDING SYSTEMS 15</head><p>Downloaded by [Ryerson University] at 06:13 18 June 2013</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Expertise Identification Technique Gap.</head><p>Because the expert-finding domain is a relatively nascent research area, until now work in this area was focused more on ascertaining the feasibility of a solution to the problem than on seeking optimal approaches and techniques. Consequently, the techniques used and their underlying assumptions also fall short of realizing systems that properly address the expert-finding problem.</p><p>Admittedly, expertise identification and representation pose immense challenges because the pool of expertise indicators is large and amorphous, expertise descriptors are difficult to extract, expert qualities are multidimensional, and users' expertise needs are mostly fine grained. The methods adopted by the existing systems to deal with these challenges are mainly based on generalizing expert finding with information retrieval assumptions and theories. Although this sort of reductionist approach helps to a certain extent, we believe that there is a need to explore the unique features and requirements of expertise identification and modeling, as well as expertise query formulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Expertise Analysis Support Gap.</head><p>As already noted, current expert finders scarcely address expertise selection. Support for expertise selection can be based on the information space as well as on other sources. From the information space, an expert finder can provide access to the expert's output as demonstrated by documents produced and can determine the expert's influence as demonstrated by citations received, coauthorship and other relationships with other experts, and so forth.</p><p>When setting out to support expertise selection, a researcher should not forget that the user is the individual who makes the selection and that the system can support this process only by providing appropriate analysis functionality. For example, the following system capabilities may considerably enhance the selection of the proper expert:</p><p>â¢ The ability to rank and contrast experts by using different user-selected criteria (rather than the mere provision of a linear listing based on a predetermined criterion). â¢ The ability to perform an example-based search for experts with one expert's model used as a query (or as a frame of reference). â¢ The presentation or explication of multiple relationships among experts. This can be used for visualizing (and catalyzing) collaboration, coauthorship, citation links, project groups, and so forth. (Note that two experts who are otherwise related may be far apart with respect to a query, and, conversely, two experts may be close with respect to a query but have little relationship to each other.) â¢ The ability to provide an ontology-based (i.e., knowledge-based) presentation or ranking of experts (subset-superset relationships, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary expertise, etc.).</p><p>One way to help users in expertise selection is to increase the system's transparency. Viewed within the framework of our domain model, this can be done by providing interfaces to access the expertise indicator sources, the expertise model and the expert model, and the expertise recognition logic. In turn, such access permits the incorporation of functionality that can assist the user in evaluating and exploring (visualizing) the expertise information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4">Reusability, Interoperability, and Extensibility Gap.</head><p>Probably because of the embryonic stage of research on expert finders, current systems focus on solving a particular problem and devising a stand-alone solution (what Cohen and Northrop <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> referred to as the "single-system mentality"). However, to support the wider variety of applications in which expert finders are needed, these systems should be both readily transferable from application to application and interoperable with other systems. Moreover, because different applications and organizational constraints may require tailored implementations of the same facet, their components need to be substitutable and extensible as appropriate. Hence, as much as possible, expert finders should be designed in a generic architecture, with modularity and reusability kept in mind.</p><p>To this end, partitioning the whole system into loosely coupled modules that implement each facet appears to be promising. We believe that the domain model presented in this article will be useful in this regard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">THE DEMOIR APPROACH</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Which Type of Expertise Model Should Be Used?</head><p>In the previous section, we argued that there is a need for an expert-finding system that can exploit heterogeneous sources of expertise indicators, that uses better techniques of expertise modeling and identification, that is flexible enough to be integrated with other systems, and that can support analysis as well as other exploitations of expertise information. A closer look at the seven facets discussed in Section 5.1 reveals that expertise models form the critical architectural foundation that determines performance and usability. Therefore, let us briefly examine the various alternatives for implementing this facet with regard to their ability to form a foundation for a solution that addresses the aforementioned gaps.</p><p>As we indicated before, we have three alternative expertise models: query-time generated, personal-agent based, and aggregated expertise models. Whereas the query-time generated approach uses dynamically generated expertise models, the other two are a priori constructed. The personal-agent based models suggest a decentralized architecture, whereas the aggregated expertise models suggest a centralized approach.</p><p>Mattox et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> argued that query-time generated expertise models have the advantage of avoiding the maintenance of (possibly outdated) information internally and permit operation in real time by using the most recent information available to locate experts. However, not surprisingly, these authors reported that their system suffers from high latency in query processing. We witnessed the same shortcoming in a comparable expert-finding system that we developed for a research department. We believe that, given the availability of search robots that can routinely gather sources of expertise indicators and can construct and update EXPERT-FINDING SYSTEMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> expert profiles, the advantage of query-time generated models is no longer important. Besides, this approach allows for limited manipulations of the expertise information (e.g., analysis, visualization, browsing, and comparison of expert profiles). The reason for this limitation is that the approach lacks persistent expertise data and cannot exploit all document types (e.g., e-mails and other personal sources are difficult to include). Exploiting diverse sources of expertise data other than documents is also difficult (e.g., recommendations from people, social relations, and feedback are difficult to incorporate).</p><p>The trade-offs between the other two approaches (i.e., aggregated expertise model and distributed personal-agent based model) are more difficult to weigh. The main advantage of using distributed personal agents is easy privacy maintenance through locality of expertise modeling, which in turn may give experts the feeling of being in control (although any access restrictions that may be imposed on an agent-based model can also be realized for aggregated models). However, this approach suffers from the limitations of relying on personal sources of information only. The fact that the expertise data are distributed results in limited accessibility and suboptimal utilization. The approach also suffers from problems of scalability when the number of experts grows large, because having individual expertise-modeling agents for numerous people overloads the network during querying in that every query is matched to all distributed personal agents.</p><p>Maintaining an aggregated expertise model overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings of the other two approaches to a great extent but introduces its own shortcomings. This approach allows for an open and multipurpose exploitation of the expertise information, manipulation of the expertise information in the aggregate, and monitoring of a wide range of organizational sources for up-to-date expertise data. It also facilitates using both knowledge-based and statistical expertise modeling (e.g., allows the analysis and grouping of experts on the basis of their expertise profiles, which facilitates inferences about the relationships among experts). However, it fails to afford localization, access to personal information sources of individual experts, and privacy of the expertise data. A more detailed discussion of this point can be found in Yimam-Seid and Kobsa <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</p><p>The optimal solution can integrate the aggregated expertise models with a personal agent-based approach. The DEMOIR (dynamic expertise modeling from organizational information resources) architecture, which we briefly discuss in the following subsection, is motivated by the desire to implement such a hybrid and flexible solution. This approach is our attempt to lay the foundations for the development and testing of better algorithms and heuristics for expertise modeling and identification based on implicit sources of expertise evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">The DEMOIR Architecture</head><p>The DEMOIR architecture, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, is a modular architecture for expertfinding systems that is based on centralized expertise models but also incorporates decentralized expertise indicator source gathering, expertise indicator extraction, and distributed clients. This architecture manages to do this by dissociating functions such as source gathering, expertise indicator extraction, and expertise modeling and delegating them to specialized components that can be separately implemented and readily combined to suit an application environment. Specifically, this architecture has the following six characteristics:</p><p>1. Configurability and extensibility at all its modules, which thereby effectively addresses the reusability, interoperability, and extensibility gap.</p><p>2. Expertise modeling that considers the heterogeneity of sources as valuable metainformation that must be exploited, as opposed to a hodgepodge that must be made uniform. For instance, the DEMOIR architecture tries to explicitly capture how the sources relate to experts and where the expertise evidence stems from and to factor this information into the expertise-modeling process.</p><p>3. A combination of distributed and centralized monitoring of expertise data from both organizational and personal information sources. As such, the DEMOIR architecture allows distributed and expert-controllable expertise indicator gathering components (like robots) that can be tailored to the specific requirements of both organizational and personal sources. This tailoring enables us to tackle some aspects of the source heterogeneity gap and privacy problems.</p><p>4. A centralized expertise information server that aggregates, stores, and supplies expertise information and provides application programming interfaces (APIs) for client implementations and integration with other systems.</p><p>5. A framework that integrates domain knowledge at all steps, and statistical and heuristics-based methods internal to components.</p><p>6. Delegation of application-specific exploitation of the expertise information (e.g., searching, browsing, analyzing, visualizing) to clients. These six characteristics are realized by the following five DEMOIR components (see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Expertise Indicator Source Gatherers.</head><p>Expertise indicator source gatherers are agents that serve as informers to the centralized expertise-modeling server by routinely gathering expertise indicator sources from various parts of the organizational information resource such as Web sites, databases, repositories, personal sources, and so forth. They are envisaged to be independent, adaptable to local constraints of the expertise indicator source that they exploit, and not controlled by any central system. They are equipped with heuristics to recognize potential sources of expertise data (e.g., memorizing experts' names and resolving name variations). They can also use techniques to trace name occurrences without a priori knowledge of experts' names by using, for example, proper noun identification methods employed in natural-language processing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>).</p><p>In addition to collecting implicit indicators of expertise by using automated gatherers, an expert-finding system should be able to collect explicit expertise data from people, when such data are available. To this end, the DEMOIR architecture aims to provide gatherers that enable people to supply expertise information and recommend experts to the system. This architecture also provides interfaces that allow users to monitor and edit automatically gathered expertise information. This feature is particularly useful in situations in which maintaining highly accurate expertise data is critical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERT-FINDING SYSTEMS 19</head><p>Downloaded by [Ryerson University] at 06:13 18 June 2013 6.2.2 Source-Type Identifier. The source-type identifier is a module that analyzes clues in the content and structure of sources to determine how they relate to the experts whose names are contained in or linked to these sources. The output of the source-type identifier is used to invoke the appropriate source wrappers (see the next subsection). Hence, the source-type identifier, along with the source wrappers, implements differentiated extraction of expertise indicators based on types of source-to-expert relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.3">Source Wrappers and Fusers.</head><p>Source wrappers are sets of modules that handle the extraction of expertise indicators from heterogeneous sources. Using both statistical techniques and heuristics, each source wrapper extracts expertise indicators from a particular source type. The expertise indicators thus extracted are merged into aggregated expertise models by the fusers. The expertise models thus constructed, along with expert profiles and other related information (e.g., the local archive of sources, expert networks), constitute what we call an expertise information space, which is maintained and managed by the expertise information space manager (EISM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.4">Expertise Information Space Manager.</head><p>The EISM manages the storage of and retrieval from the expertise information space. It specifically handles the low-level representation and maintenance of, as well as access to, the aggregated expertise model, the local expert models, and the remote expert details, which are the constituents of the expertise information space. The EISM also executes the requests from the APIs. Moreover, it enables a flexible integration of domain models (ontologies) or modules to generate them by using methods such as concept clustering.</p><p>As we distinguished in Section 5.1, the aggregated expertise model represents the expertise space in a certain domain (such as an organization), whereas expert models represent the individual experts, including a link to the aggregated expertise model and other unique information such as personal attributes and links to other experts. In other words, the expertise model represents the conceptual relation and proximity among experts, whereas the expert models represent other relations (e.g., social ties, organizational relations, coauthorship relations). In terms of McDonald and Ackerman's <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> dichotomy, we can also view expertise models as supporting expertise identification ("Who are the experts on topic X?"), whereas expert models or profiles support expertise selection ("What does expert Z know? How extensive is his or her knowledge? Which other experts relate to him or her?").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.5">Application Programming Interface.</head><p>The API facilitates the implementation of various clients to enable searches, browsing, and analyses. The API also supports the integration of the DEMOIR server in other applications.</p><p>As discussed in Section 4, expert-finding systems can be deployed in an organization in various of ways. For example, one such application is allowing people to conduct an expertise search based on keywords or descriptions of problems. Such a system can then be made available on an organization's intranet, for example. The DEMOIR API can easily support the development of such applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>In this article, we analyzed the expert-finding problem by dividing what motivates people to look for experts into two groups: information needs and expertise needs. Then, we took a closer look at the expert-finding-systems domain by using the domain analysis approach, and we presented our findings as a domain model. By overlaying the findings of these two analyses, we discussed the gaps that remain to be addressed and argued that it is more fruitful to approach them with a relatively generic architecture. In line with this, we described the DEMOIR approach that we use as a modular framework for expert finders, and we demonstrated how it addresses the observed gaps to a considerable extent.</p><p>As we suggested throughout this article, a number of issues remain open. Among the questions that need further investigation are the following: How can expertise indicator sources in organizations be identified and exploited? How should expertise and expert models be structured and represented? How should inference rules and algorithms on expert and expertise relationships be applied? And how should users be supported in searching, visualizing, and analyzing the expertise information space?</p><p>An investigation of the contextual and integration issues is also important for the proper positioning and deployment of expert-finding systems within organizations. At the level of the individual user, adaptive features in the sense of identifying and</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERT-FINDING SYSTEMS 21</head><p>Downloaded by [Ryerson University] at 06:13 18 June 2013 fulfilling expertise needs from users' daily activities are necessary (see Kobsa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> for available methods). At the organizational level, the proper organizationwide applications, services, and systems into which expert finders can be incorporated also need to be identified. Finally, privacy and security issues must also be addressed (see Schreck <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> for a reference architecture in the area of user modeling that can also be adopted in the area of expert finding).</p><p>We aim to investigate some of these issues by pursuing the development and testing of the DEMOIR server architecture using various techniques. Specifically, we intend to continue working on (a) the development and testing of heuristics for source identifiers and wrappers; (b) methods of versatile representation of the expertise information space to support a range of purposes including exploitation (search and inference), visualization, and analysis; and (c) evaluation of our approaches and techniques by implementing and testing them with users.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>EXPERT-FINDING SYSTEMS 9 Figure 1 .</head><label>91</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
