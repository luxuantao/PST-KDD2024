<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Random Number Generators (RNGs) are crucial components for the security of cryptographic systems-typical usages including key generation, initialization vectors and even countermeasures against side-channel attacks. Yet it is not easy to design hardware-based RNGs with a proved entropy rate, together with the flaw-tolerance and attack-resistance properties required by cryptographic applications. Most often, cryptographic RNGs consist of two parts: on one side, a physical (or True) Random Number Generator (TRNG) producing a random bitstream by harvesting some entropy source, and on the other side, a cryptographic mode of operation ensuring that the final outputs remain computationally unpredictable even in case of an undetected failure of the TRNG. In this paper, we investigate the design of a hardware-based TRNG with a proved security, following the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This explains our focus on a simple design, suitable for a complete and precise modeling.</p><p>A source of randomness commonly used in FPGA and ASIC implementations of TRNGs is the instability of signal propagation time across logic gates. This instability is typically accumulated in so-called ring oscillators, consisting in a series of inverters or delay elements connected in a ring. The phase jitter of a ring oscillator is then extracted by means of a sampling unit, for instance a type-D flip-flop triggered by another ring oscillator or by an external clock signal. This simple structure and the underlying physical phenomena have been widely studied in the literature as building blocks for many on-chip TRNGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. From a more theoretical point of view, an analysis of phase jitters in oscillators in given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. This paper aims to present a comprehensive statistical model of such a basic random unit, and contribute more generally to improving the security analysis of hardware random number generators.</p><p>Previous work on provably secure TRNGs based on sampled oscillators includes the works <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> that consider mathematical models based on the flipping times T k of the signal, that is, the times of its rising and falling edges. These models are natural to consider as they correspond to what can be experimentally observed on an oscilloscope. Existing works <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> report that the durations X k = T k+1 -T k between the flipping times appear in many cases to be independent and identically distributed (in short, i.i.d.), as one could expect from the physical intuition of electronic noise. This allows one to compute a safe lower bound of the entropy rate of the TRNG <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Yet, we found that such time-oriented models become quickly intractable when one wishes to compute more precise security parameters, such as the maximal bias on a short vector, or the probabilities of outputting certain bit patterns.</p><p>Our first contribution is an original approach to address this limitation using a different family of statistical models based on Wiener processes, a classical tool in the study of noisy oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. More precisely, we identify the phase of an oscillator to a one-dimensional Brownian motion, and see the outputs of the generator as a (periodic, possibly probabilistic) function of the phase. This new, phase-oriented presentation allows us to achieve exact and approximate formulas for the probabilities of occurrence and for the entropy of arbitrary-length bit-vectors, as well as a simple lower bound for the entropy rate. We validate these computations from a physical perspective by arguing, after <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, that the time-oriented and the phase-oriented models should be equivalent whenever the jitters of oscillators are small compared to their nominal periods. (This is always verified in practice.) Our formulas take as input a small number of physical parameters that still need to be measured in order to provide a full security assessment.</p><p>For that purpose, we also present an experiment designed to compute the relevant physical parameters of a given layout and a given technology. The main difficulty here is that the phase jitter of a ring oscillator, according to the model presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, is made up of several different components depending on whether the jitter is from local or global sources, deterministic or nondeterministic. From a security perspective, it is important to be able to distinguish the local Gaussian component, which is the entropy source of the TRNG, from the deterministic jitter from global sources, which can be manipulated from outside the device. Our results show that the measure of the statistical parameters of the jitter usually described in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> can be inaccurate and, sometimes, largely overestimated. To solve this issue, we present an experiment allowing to extract and precisely measure the local Gaussian component of phase jitters, by comparing the signals of two free running oscillators on the same FPGA.</p><p>Finally, we apply our formulas to deduce statistical tests directly applicable to the output sequence of a TRNG. Our tests are specifically tailored to detect over-sampled oscillators, and potentially much stronger than the general-purpose tests routinely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In particular, for a sufficiently large amount of over-sampled bits, we observe that it is feasible to recover the main statistical parameters of a TRNG.</p><p>Organization of the paper In Sect. 2, we recall the classical, time-oriented models for the sampling of oscillators, then we introduce our new, phase-oriented approach and use it to compute the security parameters of oscillator-based TRNGs. Section 3 presents an experiment designed to extract the Gaussian component of the phase jitter of a ring oscillator. Finally, in Sect. 4, we outline two special-purpose statistical tests applicable to the outputs of a TRNG in order to assess its statistical properties. Appendices A, B and C contain related proofs, additional justifications and an extension to a design made of two oscillators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Statistical Models for the Sampling of Oscillators</head><p>Motivated by the example of TRNGs based on ring oscillators, we describe two approaches to model an oscillator subject to phase jitters, and sampled by a time reference (e.g. a quartz clock signal). Whereas the first approach, based on flipping times, is classical <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, to our knowledge, the second approach, based on a Wiener processes, has never been considered in the field of secure random number generators. We focus on this new approach and derive several formulas to compute the security parameters of a TRNG, notably the biases and the entropy of bit-vectors, and as well a lower bound of the entropy rate.</p><p>For simplicity, in what follows, we keep in line with previous work in the area <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> and concentrate on symmetric (in particular, balanced) oscillators, for which the falling and rising transitions are equally distributed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Classical Approach (Time-Oriented)</head><p>A common and natural model for jittered oscillators consists in assuming that the halfperiods, that is, the durations X k = T k+1 -T k between the flipping times T k (k ≥ 0) of the signal, are independent and identically distributed random variables. In the sequel, we write m X = E(X k ) for the mean, and s 2 X = V(X k ) for the variance of X k . Once the flipping times T k are defined, the corresponding signal s(t) ∈ {0, 1} at time t ≥ 0 is described by s(t) = max{k + 1 | T k ≤ t} mod 2. This model of s(t) is often referred to as an alternated renewal process (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). Assuming a start-up time t S and a fixed sampling period t, the successive outputs of the random number generator are finally given by s(t S ), s(t S + t), . . . , s(t S + n t), . . . . This model has been widely studied in the community of cryptographic random number generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, and even generalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to allow for short-term dependencies between the X k . Notably, Killman and Schindler <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> provide an approximate lower bound for the source entropy, and present experimental results on a TRNG based on noisy diodes, which appear compatible with the i.i.d. assumption on the X k .</p><p>Although an elegant explicit formula exists for the Laplace transform of P [s(t) = 1] (see <ref type="bibr">[17, p. 334]</ref>), to our knowledge there is no general way to compute the probabilities of sampling arbitrary-length bit-vectors from alternating renewal processes, let alone if one wishes to abstract away the initial conditions by letting the start-up time t S tend to +∞. Yet, evaluating these probabilities is important to predict residual biases in the outputs of a TRNG, design specific statistical tests, or simply validate the physical model and the amount of Gaussian noise at a higher level. For these reasons, we consider another approach that directly models the phase evolution of an oscillator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">New Approach (Phase-Oriented)</head><p>Motivated by typical solutions of equations in the study of noisy oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we consider a family of models where the phase ϕ of an oscillator is analogue to a (stationary) one-dimensional Brownian motion. Accordingly, we model the evolution of the phase by a Wiener stochastic process (ϕ(t)) t∈R with drift μ &gt; 0 and volatility σ 2 &gt; 0. In other words, for any time t ≥ t 0 , the phase ϕ(t) conditioned on the values (ϕ(t )) t ≤t 0 prior to t 0 follows a Gaussian distribution of mean ϕ(t 0 ) + μ(tt 0 ) and variance σ 2 (tt 0 ). Equivalently, in terms of conditional density of probability, we have for all t, t 0 , x, x 0 ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d dx ϕ(t) ≤ x | ϕ(t 0 ) = x 0 , ϕ(t ) t &lt;t 0 = • • • = 1 σ √ 2π(t -t 0 ) exp -(x -x 0 -μ(t -t 0 )) 2 2σ 2 (t -t 0 ) (1)</formula><p>where the dots denote any set of values. (Note that both μ and σ 2 are frequencies here.) Given a value x of the phase at a given time t, the output bit s(t) is then modeled by a random variable such that the probability of s(t) = 1 is equal to g 1 (x), for some fixed 1-periodic function g 1 . Let g 0 = 1g 1 be the complementary function. Again, in terms of conditional probability, we have for all t, b, x,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P s(t) = b | ϕ(t) = x, ϕ(t ), s(t ) t =t = • • • = g b (x).</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">)<label>2</label></formula><p>The fact that g 1 is 1-periodic is related to the periodicity of the sampled signal, whose average period is thus equal to 1 μ . Another noticeable consequence is that s(t) depends only on the quantity ϕ(t) = ϕ(t) mod 1.</p><p>In the following, we concentrate on the (almost) deterministic sampling process defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">g 1 (x) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 1 if x mod 1 ∈ ] 1 2 , 1[, 0 if x mod 1 ∈ ]0, 1 2 [, 1 2 if x mod 1 ∈ {0, 1 2 }.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In other words, for such a choice of g 1 , we have that ϕ(t) ∈ ]0, 1 2 [ implies s(t) = 0, ϕ(t) ∈ ] 1  2 , 1[ implies s(t) = 1, and ϕ(t) ∈ {0, 1 2 } implies that s(t) is a pure random bit. (This last case is negligible and only motivated by Fourier series.) In particular, this ensures that each ϕ(t 0 ) follows the (same) uniform distribution, and that the source (s(t)) t∈R is stationary, that is, the probabilities of sampling bit-vectors are invariant by time-shifting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Equivalence Formulas Between Models</head><p>For real physical systems, we expect the jitters to be small, that is, σ 2 μ, in terms of Wiener process. Arguably, the sampling of such a Wiener process is equivalent to that of an alternated renewal process where the durations X k follow an inverse Gaussian distribution (a.k.a. Wald distribution):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p X k (x) = λ 2πx 3 1 2 exp -λ(x -m X ) 2 2m 2 X x for x &gt; 0<label>( 4 )</label></formula><p>with parameters</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">m X = 1 2μ and λ = m 3 X s 2 X = 1 4σ 2 .</formula><p>(5)</p><p>Indeed, on the one hand, it is well known that this distribution corresponds to the first passage time, from ϕ(0) = k 2 to ϕ(x) = k+1 2 , of a Wiener process with drift μ and volatility σ 2 (see for instance <ref type="bibr">[4, p. 221]</ref>). On the other hand, the assumption σ 2 μ allows us to ignore the possibility for the sampled signal to flip in a detectable manner because of the phase going backwards: indeed, by another classical result of Wiener processes [4, p. 212], the probability P [∃t ≥ 0, ϕ(t) ≤ ϕ(0)α] = e -2αμ/σ 2 will be infinitesimal for meaningful α &gt; 0.</p><p>Remark 1. We note that (5) allows one to set the parameters m X and s 2 X in function of μ and σ 2 , and use other distribution laws for X k . For instance, we may use a Gamma distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p X k (x) = 1 (k)θ k x k-1 e x/θ (6) with parameters k = E(X k ) 2 V(X k ) = μ 2σ 2 and θ = E(X k ) k = σ 2 μ 2 .</formula><p>In any case, we will have</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">s 2 X m 2 X = 2σ 2 μ</formula><p>1, therefore, we expect that the shape of a given distribution law will have little influence on the behavior of processes. By ex-tension, this suggests that Wiener processes suffice to approximate every physically relevant model based on renewal alternating processes. In the literature of noisy oscillators, we found that Demir et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> do relate phase-oriented processes to time-oriented processes based on Gaussian distributions.</p></div>

As emphasized by Valtchanov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, an important component of such fluctuations, the deterministic jitters from global sources, typically low-frequency and global to a FPGA, should not be confused with Gaussian phase jitters from local sources, as the former generally depends on signals such as the power source, that may leak or even be controlled by an attacker.</p><p>For that reason, we introduce a modified statistical model where the nominal frequency of an oscillator is subject to deterministic variations. We show how to validate this model experimentally by considering a layout made of two ring oscillators, and by simulating the sampling of one oscillator clock using the clock from other oscillator, in a similar manner as it is done in a type-D flip-flop.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Results</head><p>We made a series of experiments on an Altera Stratix II board with a non-well-stabilized switching power supply. We have implemented two different ring oscillators R and R made up of a NAND gate and the same number of delay elements (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The clock signals of the two oscillators are connected to output PINs and analyzed with a digital oscilloscope at 10 giga-samples per second. From the data recorded by the oscilloscope we recover two sequences, t = (t 0 , . . . , t n ) and t = (t 0 , . . . , t n ), corresponding to the flipping times of the signals of R and R , respectively. We obtained that the mean period of R is 14, 5 ns and that of R is 14, 7 ns. We remark that although R and R have identical VHDL specifications, their mean periods are not equal because of the variability of routing. Starting from the sequence t = (t i ) of flipping times of R, we compute the estimator V s ( ) from the time gaps (t (i+1)t i ).

The experiment runs as follows. Consider two similar ring oscillators R and R running on the same FPGA. Let t = (t 0 , . . . , t n ) and t = (t 0 , . . . , t n ) be the two increasing sequences of flipping times observed for R and R , respectively.

From the flipping time sequences t = (t i ) and t = (t j ) of R and R , as described above, we compute the estimator V d ( ) from (τ (i+1)τ i ) in the case of a differential measure. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> represents the graph of V d ( ) as a function of . We can see that the function V d ( ) is well approximated by an affine function. The differential measure has canceled out the influence of the deterministic jitter from global sources. By doing an affine regression on V s ( ) we obtain a line with slope 0.97, while in the case of V d ( ) the slope of the linear regression is 0.09. As a consequence, we see that the usual simple measure leads to a gross overestimation of the variance of the jitter of R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Physical Relevance of the Model</head><p>In order to use the model of Sect. 2, we have to suppose that the Gaussian jitter from local sources of a real oscillator can be modeled by i.i.d. variables X k representing the half-periods of an ideal oscillator, which deterministic jitter from global sources has filtered out. The experiments we have carried out support this assumption, in particular the fact that the graph V d ( ) as a function of , for instance one in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, is well approximated by an affine function. However, as it seems difficult experimentally to prove that the jitters that we assess with a differential measure behave like i.i.d. variables, it would be desirable to be able to qualify the impact of small dependencies of the phase jitter on the entropy rate. We leave this subject for further research.</p><p>Another assumption of our model is that falling and rising edges are equidistributed. In fact, the switching transistors employed in ring oscillators behave as nonlinear analog components and falling and rising edges have different shapes. Although we could not observe any consequence of this fact in our sampling experiments, we mention that it is easy to tweak our model in order to take into account unbalanced and/or probabilistic sampling, simply by adapting the definition of g 1 (see Sect. 2), for instance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">g biased 1 (x) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 1 if x mod 1 ∈ ] 1 2 + , 1[, 0 if x mod 1 ∈ ]0, 1 2 + [, 1 2 if x mod 1 ∈ {0, 1 2 + }.<label>(19)</label></formula><p>However, since such biased sources are easy to detect and disqualify, we have assumed a balanced distribution of 0 and 1 in this article so as to keep the mathematics as simple as possible. We also leave for future work the study of a source for which the noise rate σ 2 may depend on the time t, or, even worse, on the samples s(t).</p></div>

However, these experiments require a direct access to the (possibly multiple) ring oscillators before the signal is digitalized. In this section, we build upon the theoretical model presented in Sect. 2, and report higher-level experiments carried out directly on the bitstream of a sampled ring oscillator and applicable to any source that is presumably equivalent.</p><p>Our tests are based on the biases predicted by the statistical model when the quality factor Q = σ 2 t (see Sect. 2) is insufficient, that is, when the sampling rate 1  t is too high compared to the amount of noise available σ 2 . Such a weakened behavior can be obtained on purpose by accelerating the sampling clock. Interestingly, it could also occur in the case of a bad design or a physical attack on the generator. After discussing a simple autocorrelation test, we present numerical experiments related to the likelihood of a given sample.  </p></div>

Besides, on perfect random sources, by the central limit theorem, c(b) approximately follows a centered Gaussian distribution of variance 1 n-1 . Therefore, we may expect a source with low quality factor Q and cos(2πν) = 0 to be easily distinguished from an ideal source for large enough n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Results</head><p>We have implemented a single ring oscillator R composed of 49 inverters on an Altera Stratix II FPGA. We let the oscillator R be sampled via a type-D flip-flop triggered by a divider applied to the quartz clock signal of the FPGA, running at frequency f = 50 MHz (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Using a digital oscilloscope, we could measure the mean period of the ring oscillator: 2 m X = 33.4 ns. By performing a differential measure, we also estimated the variance of the jitter per half-period of R to be approximately s 2 X = 0.0047 ns 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Maximum Likelihood Estimation</head><p>The autocorrelation test is useful to detect flaws, but is not sufficient to estimate the physical parameters of a generator, namely its quality factor Q and its frequency ratio ν. On the other hand, the techniques used for proving Proposition 1 (see Appendix A) make it possible to compute the probability p(Q, ν, b) of a sample b in function of (Q, ν) efficiently and with good precision. Following the heuristic of maximum likelihood estimators, we may then choose the two parameters (Q, ν) that maximize the probability of a given sample. Note that the mathematical model of sampling entails p(Q, ν, b) = p(Q, ±ν + k, b) for any k ∈ Z. Therefore, we can only observe ν = |(ν + 1 2 mod 1) -1 2 | ∈ [0, 1  2 ].</p></div>

We observe that the maximum likelihood approach succeeds-that is, clearly discriminates the source from a perfect random source-for the samples D = 2559 and D = 22 598, but does not for the last sample D = 40 000. As we discuss below, this is due to the fact that the available bitstream sample is too small. In the case D = 2559, we see that global maximum of the plausibility function leads to the right value of the quality factor Q ≈ 0.01. The case D = 22 598 is less clear as the plot seems to indicate a quality factor twice as big as the expected value Q = 0.11. However, we should emphasize that the initial estimation of the quality factor Q relies on a differential measure that filters out frequency jitters from global sources, whereas the graphical estimation from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, based on maximum likelihood in the plain model, does not. Quality factor (Q) Best case (ν = 0) Worst case (ν = 0.25) &lt;0.05 &lt;1000 &lt;5000 0.1 50 000 100 000 0.2 500 000 1 000 000 0.3 2 000 000 &gt;4 000 000 Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.

In Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, we report the amounts of bits that we found usually necessary for a graphical estimation to be conclusive. Finally, to validate the equivalence between the different mathematical models (Sect. 2), we simulated several sources of 50 000 bits, with parameters Q = 0.15 and ν = 50.2, according to the model of Wiener processes (see left-hand side of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>) and two models of alternating renewal processes using Gamma and Inverse Gaussian laws (see right-hand side of Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>, respectively). The resulting graphs have very similar shapes from which we can estimate the same (correct) values for Q and ν. This confirms the intuition that the three sources behave similarly and the fact that the graphs provide correct estimations of the physical parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We have seen that the family of random bit generators made of a ring oscillator sampled by a clock signal is amenable to a comprehensive statistical study.</p><p>On the conception side, we provide practical formulas and an experimental method to control the main security parameters of a TRNG--in particular its entropy rate and the probability biases in the output bits. Incidentally, our experiments give an explanation for the observation reported in the literature that ring oscillators have a tendency to couple with each other. Indeed, there is at least one coupling between ring oscillators by the way of the deterministic jitters from global sources. Some authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> conclude  that this phenomenon significantly reduces the amount of randomness produced by a TRNG. Our observations tend to show that the deterministic jitters from global sources do not undermine the randomness of a TRNG by itself, but can lead to dangerous overestimations.</p><p>On the attacker's side, we have seen that it is easy to recover the statistical parameters of an over-sampled oscillator from a sufficiently large amount of output bits. In extreme cases, we note that this allows one to implement optimized brute-force attacks on the unknown output vectors of such a generator. Indeed, one may determine the corresponding distributions and try out the most probable values first (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for a detailed analysis).</p><p>Finally, on the performance side, we observe that, in order to achieve a near-to-one quality factor and obtain almost perfectly random bit-sequences, it is necessary to sample the ring oscillator at a very low frequency. Interestingly, our statistical model uncovers some possible approach to improve the throughput of such a TRNG. Indeed, our theoretical study (Proposition 1) suggests that the residual biases of the generator would be considerably lowered if one could lock the term cos(2πν) to a very small value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further Work</head><p>We believe that the framework described in this paper is an important step towards precise security analyses of many other designs of generators based on ring oscillators. For instance, a natural design, presumably more robust to deterministic jitters from global sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, consists of a ring oscillator sampled by another ring oscillator-the random bitstream being accommodated to the system clock through a FIFO-stack. As an encouraging result, we have proved using reasonable heuristics (see Appendix C) that such a design can be well approximated by the model considered in this paper for an appropriate choice of parameters. Another common design of generator, motivated by bit-rate efficiency, is made of a (XOR) combination of several ring oscillators before sampling (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C. Equivalent Physical Parameters of a Dual-Oscillator TRNG</head><p>In Sect. 2, we considered the sampling of an oscillator R by a perfectly stabilized clock signal. The present section is devoted to the study the sampling of an oscillator R by another ring oscillator R . We also allow small global variations of frequency for R and R as considered in Sect. 3. Our goal is to show that such a complex system is still well approximated by the simple framework of Sect. 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model and Physical Assumptions</head><p>We model the phase of the sampled oscillator R by a Wiener process of variable speed μ(t) = μ α(t) and volatility σ 2 . As for the sampling oscillator R , for simplicity, we directly model the flipping times T k and assume the variables X k = T k+1 T k α(t) dt to be i.i.d. according to some distribution of mean m X and standard deviation s X . (Here we omit the prime symbols for readability.)</p><p>As before, the physical assumptions of our models are the following:</p><p>(i) σ 2 μ (small local jitters for R).</p><p>(ii) s X m X (small local jitters for R ).</p><p>(iii) α(t) ≈ 1 (small deterministic perturbations on R and R ).</p><p>(Note that we do not assume α(t) to have low frequency variations, here.) To compare this setting with the simpler model of Sect. 2, we proceed in two steps. First, we generalize the method used in Appendix A to reason about the effect of time evolution on phases. Second, we use the physical assumptions above to argue that the sampling of R by R can be well approximated by the sampling of a single oscillator R by a periodic time reference, that is, following the model initially considered in Sect. 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase Evolution Revisited</head><p>In Appendix A, we noticed that, for an oscillator R with constant statistical parameters μ and σ 2 , the evolution of the conditional distribution of the phase from time t k to time t k+1 ≥ t k is expressed by a convolution product:   <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure">E</ref>[t] operating on the Fourier coefficient of p k (x | ξ) similarly as for the proof of Proposition 3. We now argue that in the physical cases under consideration, these new operators are in fact well approximated by the same operators as before, using suitable parameters.</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">p t k+1 (x | ξ) = p t k (x | ξ) * f μ(t k+1 -t k ),</formula><p>Interpretation Above, we have let σ 2 (t) = σ 2 α(t) instead of σ 2 (t) = σ 2 in the model of Sect. 3.2. This approximation is justified by the assumptions (i) and (iii) that σ is small and α(t) ≈ 1.</p><p>Formula (C.5) is similar to (C.1) except that the Gaussian density is replaced by a function g(x) * g(x) obtained by averaging the durations between two sampling times.</p><p>We note that the two formulas are exactly equivalent when X = t 2 with probability 1: indeed, g(x) * g(x) = f μ t,σ 2 t (x). When X has a very small variance (assumption (ii)), g(x) * g(x) will be very close to a Gaussian function, and therefore we can approximate the behavior of the two composed oscillators by a single one.</p><p>More precisely, we compute the mean and the variance of the approximation of g(x) * g(x) as follows. Let m X and s 2 X be the mean and the variance of X. By assumption (ii), s X m X , therefore, letting f (x, y) = f μy,σ 2 y (x), we have the following approximation: Given that f (x, y) is infinitely derivable and for every i, j, k ≥ 0, for every y 0 , |x k ∂ i+j f ∂x i y j (x, y)| is bounded by a summable function of x, in the neighborhood of y 0 , we may compute the first central moments of g(x) as follows: (C.12) </p><formula xml:id="formula_62">g(x) =</formula><formula xml:id="formula_63">+∞ -∞ x 2 g(x) dx -(μ m X ) 2 ≈ +∞ -∞ x 2 f (x, m X ) dx -(μ m X ) 2 + s 2 X 2 +∞ -∞ x 2 ∂ 2 f</formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acknowledgements</head><p>We are very thankful to Frédéric Valette for his support to this project and for his contributions to the physical experiments. Our work also greatly benefited from early discussions with Sébastien Kunz-Jacques, who brought the idea of using specific statistical tests, and with Jean-Michel Lévy-Bruhl, who suggested the need for a simpler mathematical model. These values must be doubled for g(x) * g(x). Finally, we obtain that the composition of R and R by means of a type-D flip-flop is equivalent to a system made of single oscillator R sampled by a time reference, with frequency ratio ν = 2μ m X and quality factor Q = 2σ 2 m X + 2μ 2 s 2 X .</p></div>
