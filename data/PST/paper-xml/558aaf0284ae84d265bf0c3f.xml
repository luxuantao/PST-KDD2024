<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we propose a new tactile sensor skin ("Skin by Touch Area Receptor" or STAR). The skin consists of two components. One is a sensor element which detects a contact area in addition to a contact force. The element is inspired by the fact that humans can discriminate sharpness of objects sensitively on any part of their bodies in spite of their several-centimeter Two Point Discrimination Thresholds. We have developed the sensor element that has such characteristics in a very simple structure; two layers of compressible insulators (urethane foam) which are sandwiched between three pieces of stretchable conductive sheets (conductive fabric). The other component is a sensor/communication chip. The chips are arranged at the boundaries of the elements, and the chips measure the capacitances between the conductive layers and send signals through the same conductive layers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recently, there is a growing interest in home robots that can care for the aged and young children <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and that can be alternatives to companion animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In that situation, robots at home are required to be more cautious about surrounding environments than robots at industrial factories, because they interact with humans directly and there are obstacles and unpredictable events around them. To meet this requisite, robot skins which give tactile sensation to the robots are demanded in robotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The major requirements for robot skins are the following. They should sensitively detect rich tactile information related to such parameters as shape, pressure, friction, temperature, and so on. They should cover several-square-meter large areas such as whole surfaces of robots. They should be soft and stretchable to contact humans safely and fit robot surfaces. Softness is one of important factors to detect touch feelings, too.</p><p>In order to realize such a robot skin, various arrays of pressure-sensitive tactile sensor elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> have been tried. One approach to enhance the ability of the sensors for practical uses is to array the elements in high density. However, we have no practical techniques available now with which we can mount a million of tactile elements with 1 mm spacing in a stretchable sensor skin.</p><p>We propose a new tactile sensor skin ("Skin by Touch Area Receptor" or STAR) which is based on a new tactile sensing method to solve the problem that is mentioned above. In our method, a sensor element dares to have a large sensing area (several square centimeters) unlike the other elements in the literature, and it acquires not only a contact force but also a contact area . Owing to the additional sensing parameter, i.e. the contact area, a robot skin which detects minute shape features of object surfaces is easily realized by arraying the elements in low density. In consequence, we can cover a whole surface of a robot with a small number of the elements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The above proposition is inspired by the characteristics of the human tactile sensation. While Two Point Discrimination Thresholds (TPDT) of humans are as large as several centimeters except on especially sensitive parts, faces and hands , humans can discriminate sensitively sharpness of objects even on such large TPDT parts. Although we still don't know exactly why and how the human skins perform like that, from these facts, we consider that sharpness is one of key components to produce general human tactile sensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and suppose that sensitivity to sharpness is a high priority for human-like sensor skins.</p><p>Based on the proposition, we developed a new tactile sensor element <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The sensor element consists of two layers of compressible insulators and three pieces of stretchable conductive sheets. In order to acquire the contact force and the contact area, we make use of the nonlinear elasticity of the insulators.</p><p>In this paper, we connect the sensor elements to realize a robot skin by a new connecting method well suited to the elements. In the method, the conductive pieces work not only as sensor elements but also as communication paths when sensor/communication chips are placed at the boundaries of the conductive pieces <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Thus, wires to the sensor elements are no longer needed and stretchable skins can be realized.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Firstly, section II describes the structure and the sensing theory of the sensor element. Results of experiments examining the feasibility of the element are also showed. After that, we explain about the proposed sensor skin system in section III. Developed CMOS LSI chips for connecting the sensor elements without long wires are introduced. Finally, we conclude this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SENSOR ELEMENT</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Structure</head><p>The structure of our sensor element is very simple. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we show schematically the cross-section of the sensor element prototype. The sensor element consists of two compressible insulator layers; the upper and lower layers are soft (15 kg/m 3 ) and hard (60 kg/m 3 ) urethane foam, respectively, and each layer is 2 mm in thickness. There are three pieces of stretchable conductive fabric on the soft layer, between the soft and hard, and under the hard. Each piece has an area of 30×30 mm 2 . The side length of the conductive fabric piece is comparable to the TPDT on human forearms. The insulator layers and the conductive pieces adhere to each other by soft double-faced tape, and two capacitors are formed in the layers. Supposing that a robot surface is hard, we attach the bottom of the sensor element prototype to an acrylic base.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Sensing Theory</head><p>We suppose a surface stress as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; a uniform surface stress distribution σ(x, y) [Pa] is vertically loaded to the surface of the sensor element in a contact field S, that is,  where F [N] is the total intensity of the contact force and S [m 2 ] is the area of S. Now we take note of the area of S, not the shape, so we suppose that S is circular for simplicity. We also assume the following. First, the nonlinear elasticity of the insulator layers is the entropy elasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) ( ) ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ ∉ ∈ ≡ S , if 0 S , if / ) , ( y x y x S F y x (1)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">) 2 , 1 ( 1 3 2 = ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ - = n E n n n λ λ (2) n n n d d Δ - ≡ 1 λ (3)</formula><p>where n is the layer identification; n = 1 means the upper soft layer and 2 the lower hard layer. E n [Pa], λ n and d n [m] are the Young's modulus, the extension ratio and the initial thickness of the layer n, respectively. E 1 is about 4.8 kPa and E 2 is 15 kPa. The following expression of λ n (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) is obtained by solving (2),</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">3 3 3 3 4 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ + - + ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ + + = n n n E E σ σ λ .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Second, the conductive pieces have negligible tensions and the Poisson's ratios of the insulator layers are zero, which means that a displacement distribution Δd n (x, y) [m] is determined simply by the local value of σ(x, y). We measure electric capacitances C n [F] between the conductive pieces to detect Δd n (x, y). Ignoring fringing fields, the capacitances are formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y x y x d d C n n n n d d ) , ( Element ∫∫ Δ - = ε (5)</formula><p>where ε n [F/m] is the dielectric constant of the layer n. If we can make the second assumption mentioned above, (C 1 , C 2 ) is  uniquely determined by (F, S). Then the key question is whether the inverse mapping from (C 1 , C 2 ) to (F, S) is possible or not for the layers, 1 and 2, having different hardness.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows a numerical simulation result for the elasticity moduli E 1 = 4.8 kPa and E 2 = 15 kPa. It shows that (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 )s for various (F, S)s span a two dimensional space, where (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 ) are the capacitance variations by the applied force, and D is the parameter defined as π / 2 S D ≡ <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> to represent the diameter of S for a circular object. It implies that we can determine (F, S) uniquely from (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 ) when F is larger than a threshold, now around 1.0 N.</p><p>Note that the nonlinear elasticity of the insulator layers plays a key role in the sensing theory. In the case of linear elastic insulator layers, i.e. σ &lt;&lt; E n , it is impossible to estimate S from (C 1 , C 2 ). λ n of the linear elastic insulator is calculated by approximating (4) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">n n E σ λ - ≅ 1 (7)</formula><p>Then ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) can be approximated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">n n n n n E d F C C ε + ≅ 0 (8)</formula><p>where C n0 is the initial capacitance of the layer n. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> means that neither C 1 nor C 2 contains the parameter S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Experiments and Results</head><p>We conducted experiments to examine the feasibility of the proposed sensing method. We measured C n of a sensor element prototype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) by a self oscillation method; we generated a RC oscillation including the sensor element as the capacitor, and counted pulses par 2 ms by a 16-bit counter. A PC imported data via a digital I/O, and achieved around 80 Hz effective sampling rate. 2) Effect of Surface Configuration: A robot skin should perform well even when it is attached on a curved surface of a robot. This experiment examined whether the prototype could discriminate the four stimulators A, B, C, and D when it was placed on the base with the hemispherical bump shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. As in 1), each stimulator was vertically pressed at the center of the sensor element by hand with increasing force up to around 10 N in 0.5 s. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, the (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 )s during the motion are plotted. It is also confirmed possible to discriminate the four stimulators when the element is attached to the curved surface.</p><p>3) Effect of Contact Position: The sensitivity of the sensor element is not affected by contact positions because C n is a spatial integration value. This experiment examined whether the outputs of the prototype had some relationship with the contact positions on the surface of the prototype. We pressed the center and the corners of the sensor element as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> by the stimulator B. The other conditions were the same as the experiment in 1). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>, the (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 )s during the motion are plotted. It is confirmed that the maximal deviation is about 0.2 pF and sufficiently small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Effect of Force Direction:</head><p>The sensor element is not sensitive to forces which are parallel to the surface of the element because only normal forces affect the distance between the conductive pieces. This experiment examined whether the outputs of the prototype had some relationship with the force direction, i.e. the existence of the surface shear stress. We pressed the center of the sensor element by the stimulator A not only vertically but also aslope at angles of ±45° from the vertical line. The other conditions were the same as the experiment in 1). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref>, the (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 )s       </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6) Reproducibility of Results:</head><p>This experiment examined whether the outputs of the prototype were reproducible. We used the six acrylic circular-cylinder stimulators with diameters D = 10 mm, 16 mm, 20 mm, 26 mm, 30 mm, and 40 mm. Each stimulator was vertically pressed at the center of the sensor element quasi-statically by a mechanical setup (a zstage) measuring the pressing force. This setup is for more detailed data than the previous experiments, especially about the force. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref>, the averaged (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 )s of the five trials are plotted with the error bars representing the maximal deviations. It is confirmed that the outputs were stable during the five trials. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SENSOR SKIN SYSTEM</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Structure</head><p>We are developing a sensor/communication chip that measures the capacitance C n and transmits signals to the host computer without long wires. Eliminating long wires is crucial to realize a practical elastic sensor skin. In our method, we use the conductive pieces of the sensor elements also for signal transmission. The scheme of the sensor skin system is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref>. The system consists of the arrayed sensor elements and the sensor/communication chips arranged at the boundaries of the sensor elements. While we will arrange the chips at all four sides of the sensor elements in future, we now connect the elements in a row for simplicity of the protocol. Each sensor element has its specific coordinate as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref>. The element with the coordinate (0, 3) is the most upstream, and the element with (0, 0) connected to the host computer is the most downstream. While the number of the sensor elements is only 16 in the current version, additional elements could be connected in the same manner.</p><p>The cross-section of the sensor skin is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">16</ref>. There are four conductive layers; the layers A, B, C, and D are the ground layer, the sensor/signal layer, the other sensor layer, and the power layer, respectively. The chips are connected to the conductive layers through electrode washers and fixed by plastic screws. The layers A and D (the ground and power layers) supply the chips with power. These two layers also function as electrostatic shields. The layers A and B sandwich the soft insulator layer forming the capacitor C 1 , and the layers B and C sandwich the hard insulator layer forming C 2 . The data packets are multi-hopped through the layer B (the signal layer) to the host computer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Packets and Operations</head><p>In the current version of the protocol, two kinds of packets, the data packet and the command packet, are employed. The packets are transmitted downstream (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref>). The data packet contains the measured data and the coordinate of the sensor element, and the command packet contains the cue signal for the next chip to measure the capacitances of the sensor element.  The chip is on standby when there is no packet. In receiving the data packet, the chip transfers the identical packet to the downstream chip through the signal layer. On the other hand, in receiving the command packet, the chip executes the following two-step sequence. Firstly, the chip measures the capacitances C n and sends the data packet containing the measured data to downstream chip through the signal layer. Next, the chip generates and sends the command packet. By the iteration of this process, the host computer can gather the data from the all sensor elements. The most upstream chip connected to the (0, 3) sensor element alone executes the above sequence spontaneously at adequate intervals without waiting for the command packet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Measurement Method</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref> shows the equivalent circuit of the measurement system. There is the reference capacitor Cref inside the chip connected through a switch SW to the junction of the capacitors C 1 and C 2 . The chip measures the divided voltage Vout between the power voltage Vdd and the ground. The divided voltages are represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Vdd C C C Vout 2 1 2 ) OFF ( + = (9) Vdd Cref C C C Vout + + = 2 1 2 ) ON (<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where Vout(OFF) and Vout(ON) mean the voltages of the junction when the switch SW is off and on, respectively. The chip sends the values of Vout(OFF) and Vout(ON) after coding them by an A/D converter on the chip. We can know C 1 and C 2 by solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The chip has the initialization process before the measurement of Vout(OFF) and Vout(ON) in which the charges in C 1 , C 2 and Cref are all released. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Prototype of Sensor/communication Chip</head><p>At the present stage, we have completed fabrication of the first prototype of CMOS LSI based on 0.35 μm rules for the sensor/communication chip (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">18 a</ref>). While the size of the LSI is 5×5 mm 2 , the total area of the analog-digital mixed circuits is within 1.5 mm 2 . The operating frequency of the LSI is 50 MHz. Each chip measures Vout with an 8-bit A/D converter and it has a function to transmit the data to the neighboring chip. We packaged the LSI on a compact (16×18 mm 2 ) flexible substrate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">18 b</ref>). It can be folded in half (16×9 mm 2 ). Although this first prototype needs an additional front-end circuit IC (5×6 mm 2 ), the next version will not need it and can be packaged in a substrate that is half in size from the present one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Test Model of Robot Skin</head><p>We developed a test model of STAR using the first prototype of the LSI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">19</ref>). Because the protocol of the prototype is simpler than explained above, positions of the chips are different from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref> and there are additional layers for signal transmission (i.e. the layer B in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">16</ref> is only used as the sensor layer). The test model is a 2×2 array and the size of each element is 30×30 mm 2 . We verified that the chips measured the capacitances of the sensor elements and the data were transmitted to the host computer successfully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a new tactile sensor skin, STAR. One component is a several-square-centimeter sensor element using the nonlinear elasticity to acquire not only a contact force but also a contact area. The other component is a sensor/communication chip for a sensor network without long wires. By combining these two technologies, we can achieve a soft and stretchable robot skin. The developed test model of the robot skin is presented.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Illustration of STAR (Skin by Touch Area Receptor).

Measured trajectories of (ΔC1, ΔC2)s for the stimulators A: D = 0.5 mm, B: D = 10 mm, C: D = 20 mm, and D: D = 40 mm. 1) Basic Performance: This experiment examined whether the sensor element prototype could discriminate four different acrylic circular-cylinder stimulators; A: D = 0.5 mm (as a concentrated load), B: D = 10 mm, C: D = 20 mm, and D: D = 40 mm (as a whole-area load). Each stimulator was vertically pressed at the center of the sensor element by hand with increasing force up to around 10 N in 0.5 s. Then the values of ΔC 1 and ΔC 2 increased with the contact force. In Fig. 7, the (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 )s during the motion are plotted. It is confirmed possible to discriminate the four stimulators.2) Effect of Surface Configuration: A robot skin should perform well even when it is attached on a curved surface of a robot. This experiment examined whether the prototype could discriminate the four stimulators A, B, C, and D when it was placed on the base with the hemispherical bump shown in Fig.8. As in 1), each stimulator was vertically pressed at the center of the sensor element by hand with increasing force up to around 10 N in 0.5 s. In Fig.9, the (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 )s during the motion are plotted. It is also confirmed possible to discriminate the four stimulators when the element is attached to the curved surface.3) Effect of Contact Position: The sensitivity of the sensor element is not affected by contact positions because C n is a spatial integration value. This experiment examined whether the outputs of the prototype had some relationship with the contact positions on the surface of the prototype. We pressed the center and the corners of the sensor element as illustrated in Fig.10by the stimulator B. The other conditions were the same as the experiment in 1). In Fig.11, the (ΔC 1 , ΔC 2 )s during the motion are plotted. It is confirmed that the maximal deviation is about 0.2 pF and sufficiently small. 4) Effect of Force Direction: The sensor element is not sensitive to forces which are parallel to the surface of the element because only normal forces affect the distance between the conductive pieces. This experiment examined whether the outputs of the prototype had some relationship with the force direction, i.e. the existence of the surface shear stress. We pressed the center of the sensor element by the stimulator A not only vertically but also aslope at angles of ±45° from the vertical line.

After that, a time delay until returning to the initial condition was observed when stimulator was released. This phenomenon is because of the viscoelasticity of the insulator layers. F and S are estimated as wrong values during the phenomenon that lasts about 1 s.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,58.44,451.80,225.12,141.36" type="bitmap" /></figure>
