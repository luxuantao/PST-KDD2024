<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Modern communication systems and networks, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and cellular networks, generate a massive and heterogeneous amount of traffic data. In such networks, the traditional network management techniques for monitoring and data analytics face some challenges and issues, e.g., accuracy, and effective processing of big data in a real-time fashion. Moreover, the pattern of network traffic, especially in cellular networks, shows very complex behavior because of various factors, such as device mobility and network heterogeneity. Deep learning has been efficiently employed to facilitate analytics and knowledge discovery in big data systems to recognize hidden and complex patterns. Motivated by these successes, researchers in the field of networking apply deep learning models for Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis (NTMA) applications, e.g., traffic classification and prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive review on applications of deep learning in NTMA. We first provide fundamental background relevant to our review. Then, we give an insight into the confluence of deep learning and NTMA, and review deep learning techniques proposed for NTMA applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges, open issues, and future research directions for using deep learning in NTMA applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>During the last years, NTMA have received much attention as a significant research topic in supporting the performance of networking <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As common solutions in network management, NTMA techniques have been introduced both by industry and academia <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Although different NTMA techniques have been introduced, emerging networking technologies and paradigms have made establishment of efficient networks complex. New networks with thousands of nodes e.g. Internet of Things (IoT) need to be monitored on a regular basis to maintain their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Different purposes in networking trigger the network managers to evaluate a network in terms of, e.g. security challenges, supporting Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and resource consumption improvement, to name a few <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These purposes are satisfied by applying NTMA techniques e.g. anomaly detection, network traffic classification, fault management, and traffic prediction.</p><p>NTMA techniques are classified into two main groups: (1) active methods, and (2) passive methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Active methods involve generating and injecting probe traffic into a network in order to learn about the state of the network. More precisely, test traffic data is injected into the network based on scheduled sampling, and then different network performance metrics will be measured. Examples of the metrics include network throughput, packet loss ratio, latency, and jitter (or delay variation). Since active monitoring methods present a real-time insight about performance, they are the primary methods to control Service Level Agreement (SLA) based services. In contrast, passive methods are mainly used to monitor and analyze real network traffic in the network. Passive methods have received much interest from industry for managing and planning purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Passive methods, unsurprisingly, do not need another site in the network to be involved. These methods can be used to carefully monitor traffic, particularly in post-event situations e.g. fault tolerance and troubleshooting. Moreover, they are ideally suited for obtaining deep insights into the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). The applications of active and passive methods are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The growth of the communication systems and networks in terms of the number of users and the amount of generated traffic, poses different daily challenges to NTMA, including: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> storing and analyzing traffic data, (2) using traffic data for business goals through gaining insight, (3) traffic data integration, (4) traffic data validation, (5) traffic data security, and (6) traffic data acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. The unprecedented increase in the number of connected nodes and the volume of data amplify the network complexity, calling for continuing studies to analyze and monitor the networking performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Furthermore, the availability of massive and heterogeneous amount of traffic data necessitates adopting new approaches for monitoring and analyzing the network management data. Due to these challenges, most works focus specifically on one aspect of NTMA, e.g. anomaly detection, traffic classification, or QoS <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Among the challenges mentioned above, traffic data acquisition presents enormous technical difficulties in the field of NTMA, particularly for active measurements as one has to use probes to evaluate the progression of crucial network parameters over time. Probes are among the most efficient methods to obtain insights into the end-to-end performance experienced by the end-users. Active and passive probes are two common strategies that can improve the performance of end-toend measurement and determine QoS and QoE by delivering granular traffic data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. An active probe tries to emulate the network traffic and then send emulated traffic within the network to measure the endto-end performance (e.g., latency). In comparison to the active probes, passive probes present a distinct viewpoint of the network. Passive probes are placed on links in the network, and they inquire all the traffic that transmits through the connection being monitored.</p><p>Regarding particular network scenarios and the purposes of traffic data gathering (e.g., traffic classification and intrusion detection), one Non-real-time monitoring Real-time monitoring of end-to-end transport processes Service and customer experience monitoring can define different requirements for traffic data acquisition. In other words, it is not required to acquire all available data from a network in a traffic acquisition task. Hence, the network packets are commonly regarded as the central targets that should be examined in the traffic data acquisition tasks. To monitor the network traffic to evaluate its performance, there are two fundamental methods including Shallow Packet Inspection (SPI) and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). As the former refers to gather information from headers of packets of network traffic, the latter processes all contents of a packet including user's data. Probes can use both techniques to gather network information but DPI has some disadvantages including:</p><p>• Analyzing users' data can jeopardize the privacy of users.</p><p>• Processing the whole packet needs more time and resources compared to processing the header. • In some types of network traffic, e.g. Virtual Private Network (VPN) and encrypted network traffics, DPI is unusable.</p><p>Based on the challenges mentioned above for using DPI, most of probes in new NTMA techniques use SPI. After providing a background to the probes, we highlight that one of the significant challenges in NTMA is acquiring a large amount of reliable traffic data. To deal with this challenge, some tools, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, as data acquisition and data collection architectures have been proposed during recent years. However, an adaptive and efficient data acquisition approach that can be pervasively used within heterogeneous and large-scale modern networks is still missing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The network packets are yet the most widespread data format for network traffic collection. However, the majority of the network packet collection methods are confronted by the packet loss problem, particularly when they confront a large amount of traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Moreover, these methods have difficulties with high-speed links and become ineffective due to their low capability. The flow-based data gathering techniques are another popular data collection mechanism. A flow network is a set of network packets with the same features, such as source/destination IP address and source/destination ports. Compared to the packet-based mechanisms, the flow-based data gathering techniques can decline the number of needed tasks for packet analysis and provide a better performance, especially in Gigabit Networks. Nonetheless, packet and flow filtering can seriously challenge these techniques. Several survey papers about traffic data acquisition methods, approaches, and architectures have been published e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Modern networking solutions are under pressure of new phenomenon, known as big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This fact is based on special characteristics of network management data e.g. high volume, high velocity, high veracity, and high variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Network management data refers to all data that reflects the network situation, mainly extracted from headers of packets (packet-level feature) e.g. packet delay, time stamps, and type of packet. NTMA techniques can be considered as one of the main consumers of big data. Besides, it is becoming a critical field of study in the context of big data analytics due to data complexity. Conventional data processing techniques for NTMA include:</p><p>• Mathematical and statistical methods (e.g. regression for timeseries analysis)</p><p>• Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and big data processing approaches (e.g. supervised learning for intrusion detection)</p><p>NTMA techniques should perform a sequence of steps for transforming raw traffic data into useful information. Using the conventional methods for big data analytics faces multiple challenges and issues, including accuracy, high-speed analytics, and effective processing of big data in a real-time manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Furthermore, based on new paradigms like Internet of Things (IoT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a high number of connected devices produce a massive volume of raw data every day, and thus, we need more effective methodologies to monitor and analyze such massive amount of raw data in a more efficient way in terms of processing time and space.</p><p>As mentioned above, ML techniques have received much attention in NTMA techniques. ML techniques are grouped into four groups as mentioned below: (1) Supervised Learning, (2) Semi-supervised Learning, (3) Unsupervised Learning, and (4) Reinforcement Learning. Among various ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) is a key step to considerably ease the analytics and knowledge discovery in the big data field <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. DL has been used in many fields, including computer vision, healthcare, transportation, and smart farming. In addition, DL has also gained attention from technology-based companies (TBC). Large companies such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook produce huge amounts of data every day, and hence, it is crucially important for them to handle this big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. DL algorithms are utilized to analyze produced data and extract meaningful information because for traditional data processing techniques it is almost impossible to handle such a huge amount of data. This paper gives an insight into the confluence of two emerging technologies, i.e. NTMA and deep learning. The paper does not cover all the possible NTMA applications as there is a long list of NTMA applications in the literature. We only investigate four key applications, including traffic classification, traffic prediction, fault management and network security as the main topics of NTMA, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Contributions</head><p>This work is intended for the vertical domains and researchers in the field of communication systems and networks, who want to use AIbased analytics systems on top of their communication infrastructures. The main contributions of our work in this paper include the following:</p><p>• We review the well-known literature that has surveyed traditional learning-based techniques for NTMA and highlights their differences with our work. • To use deep models for NTMA, we discuss the key characteristics and applications of NTMA. • We review the advanced DL techniques used in the main NTMA applications and their applicability in the NTMA domain. • We survey the literature that uses DL techniques in four fields of NTMA including traffic classification, fault management, traffic prediction, and network security. • We present the challenges and future research directions regarding NTMA and DL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first that investigates the relation between NTMA and DL and reviews the applications of DL models in NTMA. A few works exist in the literature that have focused on data mining applications and traditional ML models in NTMA. It is noteworthy to mention that a limited number of papers present DL models for some NTMA applications, e.g., traffic classification. The work presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> by Rezaei et al. surveyed DL models for encrypted traffic classification. This paper addressed different DL-based classification models for network traffic classification. Nevertheless, it did not review other NTMA applications, which are the focus of our paper.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Aniello et al. surveyed basic ML models (supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning) in the context of malware analysis. Moreover, the related challenges and issues are discussed in this paper. However, the authors did not investigate the importance of DL in malware analysis and detection.</p><p>The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> by Conti et al. conducts an in-depth survey on network traffic analysis. They categorize the relevant works into three criteria: (1) the aim of the analysis, (2) the point in the network where the traffic is monitored, and (3) the selected mobile platforms. They reviewed several algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, C4.5 decision tree, Random forest, k-means, to name a few. The work focuses on mobile devices and compares analysis methods, validation techniques, and achieved results. In addition, the focus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> was mainly on conventional ML algorithms, whereas our work targets DL models.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, DL models and architectures for network traffic control systems have been studied by Fadlullah et al. Since this paper primarily covers the network infrastructure, it differs from our survey that targets the use of deep models in NTMA. D'Alconzo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> addressed a big data approach for NTMA. The authors surveyed the works that employ big data approaches to understand network traffic data in that work. Moreover, they briefly reviewed big data analytics (e.g., traditional machine learning) for four main NTMA applications, i.e., traffic classification, traffic prediction, fault management, and network security. As the main difference, DL models have not been considered in this paper.</p><p>Finally, Verma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> surveyed real-time analysis of big IoT data. In this work, the authors reviewed the latest network data analytics methods, which are appropriate for real-time IoT network data analytics. Moreover, in that paper, the foundations of real-time IoT analytics, use cases, and software platforms are discussed. Similar to the works mentioned above, that paper did not study DL models for data analytics purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Overview of NTMA</head><p>NTMA refers to a range of techniques to monitor the network traffic at an appropriate level of granularity (e.g., at the packet level). The NTMA techniques obtain deep insight into the operation and performance of the network and users' behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In the context of communication systems and networking, NTMA has played a critical role in:</p><p>1. understanding how networks work and monitoring the performance of networks 2. how consumers are using resources and optimizing the use of resources 3. how to effectively control and manage the telecommunication infrastructures to provide SLA Due to the explosive growth of connected devices and the volume of traffic data, more advanced NTMA techniques are needed to ensure communication systems' stability and availability. In the following, we focus on the general framework for NTMA, comprising five steps. Most existing research works follow all or part of the framework based on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The first step towards NTMA is to clearly define the goals of NTMA. As mentioned above, the typical goals include traffic classification, traffic prediction, fault management, and network security. Depending on the target goal, one may need to work towards different sub-goals in order to serve the primary goal. For example, if the aim of NTMA is to classify network traffic, the sub-goal can be the categorization of traffic data into different classes based on their labels, such as VPN and non-VPN traffic or Firefox and Chrome. The second step is to gather network management data by using passive or active monitoring methods. Due to the fact that these two methods provide different views of the network status, they can be used in cooperation to take benefit of both methods.</p><p>Data preprocessing and cleaning can greatly affect the performance of NTMA, especially ML-based approaches. In a network, the distribution of packet-level features may change by some common activities, such as packet retransmission and duplicated ACKs. Hence, removing such network management data can improve NTMA applications' performance, e.g., traffic prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Normalization is another preprocessing technique towards improving the performance of NTMA applications, especially it is crucially important for ML-and DL-based approaches.</p><p>Then, after data preprocessing, NTMA has to go through a feature selection step to select the most informative features for serving the goal. Feature selection can be performed automatically or manually. In the former, feature selection algorithms are used to extract the most relevant features, and the latter uses domain knowledge to perform feature selection.</p><p>After the above steps, data analysis experts perform an in-depth analysis of the preprocessed data in order to extract meaningful information. As mentioned in the introduction section, mathematical and statistical methods, ML algorithms, and big data approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> are the traditional approaches to retrieve meaningful knowledge from the raw data. Selecting the most appropriate model or technique from the existing approaches is important for a reliable and reproducible statistical inference. ML-based approaches overcome the mathematical and statistical methods by their abilities to discover hidden patterns about the raw data. In communication systems and networks, ML methods have been used in many applications such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, anomalies detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and pattern discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The enormous volumes of human-and machine-generated traffic, e.g., web surfing and IoT networks, calls for the design of scalable algorithms and tools to handle such a huge amount of data in a short time. Fortunately, big data frameworks such as Hadoop <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and Spark <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> are introduced to process a huge volume of data in a short time. This is mainly due to their distributed architecture and the possibility to accelerate the process through parallel processing and moving the computation program to the node, which generates the data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Network management data is different from conventional big data. Hence, to ease understanding the requirements for analysis of the data, we find it necessary to investigate the characteristics of the network management data and highlight its major differences with conventional big data. The network management data possesses several characteristics in common, including: Despite this fact that extracting hidden patterns and knowledge from big data is critical <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, it is not a complicated task as it looks. For such a difficult and demanding task that needs capabilities beyond the conventional learning-based mechanisms, novel learning approaches, learning models, and techniques are required <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>In the past few years, many NTMA applications, such as traffic classification, traffic prediction, and network security, gained attention of the academia and industry. The reason behind using NTMA consists in this fact that NTMA applications play an important role in network and resource management, network auditing methods, and intrusion detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Deep learning is one of the powerful AIdriven techniques for gaining insights into communication systems and networks. DL has been employed for many NTMA applications in recent years, e.g., traffic classification and prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. Motivated by this fact that classical ML algorithms are not able to effectively meet the emerging analytic requirements of communication systems and networks, DL achieves increasing popularity among scholars to address these requirements. Generally, DL algorithms represent two significant improvements upon the classical machine learning methods.</p><p>• They eliminate the need for the feature engineering phase via deploying automatic feature learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Hence, some useful and meaningful features that might not be apparent to manual feature engineering approaches can be obtained easily by DL algorithms. • DL algorithms improve learning performance in terms of accuracy and loss through learning hidden and high-level patterns from data. It can be achieved by feeding a huge volume of traffic data into DL models.</p><p>In this work, we explain a broad spectrum of DL architectures and survey the NTMA use cases that take advantage of DL models. This paper focuses on four main NTMA applications that can be utilized for different services and vertical domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Deep learning models</head><p>AI has attracted lots of interest in recent years for many use cases, such as self-driving cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, chatbots <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, virtual assistants <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. AI's history goes back to the 1950s, when researchers tried to automate intellectual tasks that humans normally perform. For a very long time, many experts were arguing that by formulating a large set of explicit rules for manipulating knowledge, they can realize human-like artificial intelligence. This approach, also known as symbolic AI, was a dominant method for achieving human-level artificial intelligence between the 1950s to the late 1980s. Despite this fact that symbolic AI successfully dealt with well-defined tasks, such as playing chess, it encountered difficulty with solving more complex tasks, such as speech recognition and image classification. To address this challenge, machine learning has arisen as a new approach.</p><p>The emergence of machine learning introduces a new paradigm in programming. In the paradigm of symbolic AI, human-agent enters rules (a program) and data to be manipulated according to these rules, and yield results. In contrast, in machine learning, the human agent enters data and the expected results from the data, and then the learning model yields the rules. Then, these rules are applied to new data in order to achieve original results. Machine learning systems are trainable rather than explicitly programmable. This means a massive amount of data feed into these systems to find meaningful features in this data. Then, these features can be used to produce rules for automating the task. Machine learning usually struggles with big and sophisticated datasets, such as image datasets with thousands or even millions of instances. For the classical statistical analysis, such as Bayesian analysis, it is almost impossible to handle such big datasets. Consequently, machine learning and particularly DL shows relatively little theory of mathematics and is an engineering-oriented approach.</p><p>DL is a specific sub-field of ML, in which Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used to find data representation at each layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. The deep in DL definition refers to the idea of successive layers of representations. Moreover, the number of layers for modeling the data is known as the depth of the model. For complex tasks such as image recognition, DL models often have tens or even hundreds of successive layers of representations. In contrast to DL, other machine learning models often involve one or two layers for the data representation. A DNN architecture is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>.</p><p>As a general definition, one may argue that machine learning is mapping inputs data (e.g., video and images) to targets (e.g., the label ''dog''), which is achieved by exposing the model to many instances of input and targets. Similarly, one sees that DL performs the input-to-target mapping through deep successive layers of data transformations. The DL model learns these transformations by observing many examples of input/target.</p><p>In a DL model, the layer's weights, also known as parameters, determine what transformations would be performed to a layer's input data. According to a simple definition of 'weights', they are a set of numbers (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). In the context of DL, learning refers to finding a set of correct values for the weights of all layers in a model so that the model will precisely map inputs to their related targets. Due to the fact that DL models may have tens of millions of parameters (weights), determining the correct value for all of these parameters is a challenging task. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the relationship between AI, machine learning, and DL in summary. In the following, we investigate the major DL models in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Multi-layer perceptron</head><p>A well-known category of a DL model is the feed-forward deep network or multilayer perceptron (MLP). An MLP model is an artificial neural network mapping some examples of input data to target values <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. The network is formed by composing multiple simple layers (at least three layers). We can consider the application of each layer as providing a new representation of each data point.</p><p>The main objective of an MLP model is to approximate some function 𝑓 * . For instance, in a classifier model, 𝑦 = 𝑓 * (𝑥) maps an input data x to a label y. An MLP defines a mapping 𝑦 = 𝑓 (𝑥; 𝜃) and finds the correct values for parameters 𝜃 that lead to the closest function approximation. In the feed-forward deep networks, the feedforward definition refers to the idea that input data goes through the function being evaluated from 𝑥, then flows through the intermediate computational units employed to define 𝑓 , and finally flows to the output 𝑦. One must note that in an MLP model, there are no feedback connections to feedback the outputs of the model into itself.</p><p>An MLP has at least three layers, in which computational units (or neurons) are densely connected to the next layer units (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). We assume an input data vector 𝑥 and a standard MLP network. Given these settings, the MLP carries out the following operation: 𝑦 = 𝜎(𝑊 .𝑥 + 𝑏).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>1</label></formula><p>In this expression, 𝑦 is the output of the layer, 𝑊 denotes the learning weights, and 𝑏 indicates the bias neurons. Also, 𝜎(.) is an activation function that aims to improve the model's training by allowing the nonlinearity of it. The most common non-linear activation functions are as follows:</p><p>• Sigmoid (or logistic), Where 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑(𝑥) = 1 1+𝑒 -𝑥 ,</p><p>• Tanh (or hyperbolic tangent), Where 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑥) = 𝑒 𝑥 -𝑒 -𝑥 𝑒 𝑥 +𝑒 -𝑥 , • ReLU (or Rectified Linear Unit), Where 𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈 (𝑥) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥, 0), • Leaky ReLU, Where 𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑦𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈 (𝑥) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝛼 * 𝑥, 𝑥), and 𝛼 is a small constant, e.g., 0.1.</p><p>ReLU and Leaky ReLU activation functions are proposed to deal with a critical problem in other activation functions, called gradient vanishing. The problem refers to when the loss function gradients will be vanishingly small and cannot propagate through layers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Convolutional networks</head><p>Convolutional networks, also called Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are a specific type of neural network that specialize in processing grid-like data <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Examples of this data type are time-series and images, which can be regarded as a 1-dimensional grid and 2dimensional grid of pixels, respectively. Convolutional networks have been extensively used in diverse real-world problems, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, speech recognition, etc. The term ''convolutional'' in convolutional neural networks supports this idea that CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution. In its most common form, the convolution operator is a specific type of linear operation that performs the integral of the product of two functions/signals. In other words, CNNs are neural networks that employ convolution operators instead of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their network layers. CNNs apply three key principles that can be applied to promote the performance of an ML system by reducing a model parameter space: parameters or weights sharing, sparse interactions, and equivariant representations.</p><p>The large dimensionality is an obvious disadvantage of DNN architecture, especially when the input data is too large and complicated, e.g., images. Towards dealing with this problem, the convolution operator (or convolution layer) has been introduced as an alternative for full connectivity in the DNN architecture. A graphical description of deep CNN architecture is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The CNN accepts multi-channeled images (e.g., cars and ships) as the input for training purposes. The CNN takes the benefit of multiple convolution layers with non-linear activation functions to alleviate the input's complexity (i.e., images) and produce the output, i.e., the probability of each image belonging to a class (or category). In CNN, each input zone is connected to a neuron in the output, aka local connectivity. Each layer employs various filters to recognize abstract concepts, e.g., the boundary of a vehicle. The CNN can learn higher-level features, such as different vehicle parts, at the deeper layers. Filters are not defined beforehand in a CNN; instead, it automatically learns each filter's value during the training phase. Moreover, the CNN uses the pooling layer as a method for down sampling. In the output layer, a classifier is applied to use the high-level features for the classification task. The interested readers are referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Recurrent neural networks</head><p>Recurrent neural networks (also known as RNNs), are a category of artificial neural networks appropriate for analyzing sequential data <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Unlike CNNs that are designed to work with the grid-like topology data, e.g., images, RNNs are neural networks that have specialized characteristics for operating on a sequence of values 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , … , 𝑥 𝑡 . In addition, most RNNs are able to handle variable-length sequences. The clever idea behind the recurrent networks and some other machine learning and statistical methods are to share parameters over different layers of a model to extend the use of the model for data instances with different forms. The parameter sharing task is especially crucial when a particular item of data may appear at multiple positions within the sequence. This optimization technique typically leads to significant savings of memory in machine learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. It is also possible to employ RNNs for 2-dimensional spatial data such as images. The key advantage of using recurrent networks over conventional neural networks is that RNN is able to handle sequence of data so that each sample can be considered to be dependent on previous ones.</p><p>As mentioned, RNNs are specialized to model sequences, where there is a strong sequential correlation among the sequence samples. At each time step, RNN uses the given input and the information related to what has been observed as yet (i.e., state) to generate output. Note, this information is transferred through recurrent connections between units, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>. Assume we have a sequence of input elements 𝐱 = (𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , … , 𝑥 𝑡 ). Under this setting, a RNN conducts the following computations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑆 𝑡 = 𝜎 𝑠 (𝑊 𝑥 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑊 𝑠 𝑠 𝑡-1 + 𝑏 𝑠 ) ℎ 𝑡 = 𝜎 ℎ (𝑊 ℎ 𝑠 𝑡 + 𝑏 ℎ )</formula><p>where 𝑆 𝑡 is the state of the RNN at time step 𝑡 and it acts as a memory unit for the RNN. To compute the value of 𝑆 𝑡 , a function of the input value at time 𝑡 (i.e., 𝑥 𝑡 ) and previous state of the RNN, i.e., 𝑠 𝑡-1 , has been calculated. Moreover, 𝑊 𝑥 and 𝑊 ℎ are weights to be learned during the training process, and 𝑏 𝑠 and 𝑏 ℎ are biases. In the RNN, the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> is used to update the weights or train the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Long short-term memory</head><p>RNN can use self-loops to store the gradient of recent input events for long durations. This is the core idea of long short-term memory (LSTM) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. This feature is potentially important for a wide spectrum of applications, such as speech recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, handwriting recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, handwriting generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, image captioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> and parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. LSTM has been introduced to deal with two serious problems, i.e., gradient vanishing and gradient blow up, in the former techniques. More specifically, by using the conventional gradient-based learning methods such as BPTT and real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), error signals may reduce or increase when they back-propagate over the model. LSTM network is proposed to solve the problems of error signals back-flow, by introducing the idea of using a collection of gates. LSTM has been successfully applied to many problems, such as speech recognition and text classification. A graphical illustration of the structure of an LSTM is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>. In this structure, 'forget gate' decides what information from the cell state will forget as they are unrepresentative. Indeed, the forget gate makes this decision through a sigmoid layer. The forget gate performs the following operation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑓 𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊 𝑥𝑓 𝑋 𝑡 + 𝑊 ℎ𝑓 𝐻 𝑡-1 + 𝑊 𝑐𝑓 ⊙ 𝐶 𝑡-1 + 𝑏 𝑓 ),</formula><p>In this expression, '⊙' operation is Hadamard or element-wise product, 𝐶 𝑡 represents the cell state outputs, 𝐻 𝑡 denotes the hidden states. Forget gate alleviates the gradient vanishing and gradient blow up and significantly promotes the performance of LSTM than RNN.  Another essential function of the LSTM is to decide what new information should be stored in the cell state. Towards this end, input gates 𝑖 𝑡 decides which information will be updated, and this information will provide an update to the old cell state (i.e., 𝐶 𝑡-1 ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑖 𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊 𝑥𝑖 𝑋 𝑡 + 𝑊 ℎ𝑖 𝐻 𝑡-1 + 𝑊 𝑐𝑖 ⊙ 𝐶 𝑡-1 + 𝑏 𝑓 ), 𝐶 𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑡 ⊙ 𝐶 𝑡-1 + 𝑖 𝑡 ⊙ 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑊 𝑥𝑐 𝑋 𝑡 + 𝑊 ℎ𝑐 𝐻 𝑡-1 + 𝑏 𝑐 ),</formula><p>And the final step for the LSTM is to decide what should go to output, based on the cell state. It can be done by output gates (i.e., 𝑜 𝑡 ), which decides what information of the cell state will go to output. The cell state also goes through a tanh and then multiply by the output gates.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑜 𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊 𝑥𝑜 𝑋 𝑡 + 𝑊 ℎ𝑜 𝐻 𝑡-1 + 𝑊 𝑐𝑜 ⊙ 𝐶 𝑡 + 𝑏 𝑜 ), 𝐻 𝑡 = 𝑜 𝑡 ⊙ 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝐶 𝑡 ),</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Auto-encoders</head><p>In the most general sense, an auto-encoder or AE is a neural network that is used to efficiently learn how to copy its inputs to its outputs. AE has a hidden layer, called h, which is responsible for describing a code that stands for the input. An AE network consists of two main components: an encoding function ℎ = 𝑓 (𝑥) and a decoding function 𝑟 = 𝑔(𝑥). A graphical description of the structure of an AE is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. AEs are not designed for this purpose to copy their inputs to their outputs. Instead, they attempt to copy only essential aspects of the inputs that contain useful properties of the data. Assume there is a training set of {𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , 𝑥 3 , … , 𝑥 𝑛 } where for each data sample we have 𝑥 𝑖 ∈ 𝑅 𝑛 . The objective of the AE is to reconstruct the network input by reducing the reconstruction error, i.e., 𝑦 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 for 𝑖 ∈ {1, 2, 3, … , 𝑛}. In other words, the AE attempts to learn a compressed representation of the input data. Given this objective, the AE tries to minimize the following loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝛤 (𝑊 , 𝑏) =∥ 𝑥 -𝐹 𝑊 ,𝑏 (𝑥) ∥ 2 ,</formula><p>in which 𝑊 and 𝑏 are the vectors of the network weights and biases, respectively, and 𝐹 𝑊 ,𝑏 (𝑥) is the identity function that the AE tries to learn. AEs are primarily employed as an unsupervised framework for the automatic feature extraction process. More specifically, the outputs of AE's output layers can be assumed as an abstract set of discriminative features for the categorization task, especially for high dimensional data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Deep generative models</head><p>Deep generative models or generative deep learning is an effective learning mechanism for any input data distribution through unsupervised learning. There are several kinds of generative models, such as Boltzmann machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, restricted Boltzmann machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, deep belief networks (DBNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, deep Boltzmann machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, and Boltzmann machines for real-valued data <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. According to a broad definition, a deep generative model characterizes how a specific dataset is generated with regard to a probabilistic model. Through sampling from this model, one can produce new data. Deep generative models attempt for integrating the interpretable representations and quantified uncertainty (UQ) provided by probabilistic models, into the scalability and flexibility of deep learning.</p><p>Generally, most machine learning models are discriminative models in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Discriminative models do not care about how the data was produced; they categorize a given input data. In contrast, generative models specify how the data was produced in order to categorize input data. Another critical difference between discriminative and generative modeling consists in the fact that in the former, each instance in the training dataset has a label. Hence, discriminative models are considered synonymous with supervised learning. In contrast, generative models usually use unlabeled dataset; however, they can also be employed with a labeled dataset in order to learn how to produce data instances from each distinct class label.</p><p>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a widespread method for DL-based generative modeling. GAN is a supervised training framework that simultaneously trains two sub-models: the generator model 𝐺 that tries to create new instances from training data and the discriminative model 𝐷 that attempts to categorize instances into real (from the training data domain) or fake (generated). Both 𝐺 and 𝐷 are trained through playing in a zero-sum game. More specifically, 𝐺 tries to produce new instances as real as possible and to maximize the probability of 𝐷 to be confused in recognizing these instances. The responsibility of 𝐷 is to differentiate between real instances and fake instances. In a GAN network, the overall goal is to solve a two-player minimax problem. The overall structure of a GAN has been presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> The aforementioned deep models, their attributes, and characteristics are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DL and NTMA</head><p>Machine learning techniques, especially DL algorithms, are among the most popular techniques for network traffic data processing. This is arguably explained by the fact that modern communication systems and networks, e.g., IoT and cellular networks, have distinguishing characteristics that fit DL algorithms. These features include big data generation, complexity, multimodal data, being large-scale, the growing number of protocols in such networks, etc. The traditional methods for NTMA have their own problems; for example, they are inaccurate or highly dependent on human experts. Unlike the traditional methods, DL-based techniques have some advantages to be used as NTMA techniques listed below:</p><p>• DL models do not require considerable human effort and they are not dependent on the choice of features. DL models can employ different representative layers and efficient algorithms to extract hidden knowledge from massive amounts of traffic data without feature engineering. This advantage of the DL models is very efficient for NTMA techniques as most of the network management data is unlabeled or semi-labeled <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. In the next subsections, we explore the abilities of DL models for four main NTMA applications, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">DL for traffic classification</head><p>In its broadest definition, network traffic classification refers to a system in which a program assigns traffic flows to the sources (e.g., applications and protocols) that produce them. Traffic classification has attracted ever-increasing interest over the years as a crucial step towards the network management process. Moreover, traffic classification covers a wide variety of applications in QoS purposes, pricing in Internet service providers (ISPs), anomaly detection, etc. Due to the continuing growth in Internet-based applications and the number of connected devices, applying efficient traffic classification methods is critically important. Generally speaking, one can categorize network traffic classification techniques into three basic classes as listed below <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>:</p><p>• port-based: These techniques simply associate services/applications to registered port numbers, e.g. HTTP port, and categorize the traffic according to the used port number. Port-based techniques are among the earliest traffic classification methods. Despite the advantages of port-based techniques such as simplicity on implementation, deploying new communication methods such as tunneling and random ports assignments techniques cause serious difficulties and affect the performance and applicability of them. • payload-based: Payload-based methods, also known DPI, closely investigate the content of the captured packet, especially the application layer-related information, in order to associate the packet to a specific service/application. In order to make a prediction, this methodology usually leverages predefined signatures or patterns for each communication protocol, and then discover these patterns to differentiate the traffic flows from each other. Payload-based classification techniques suffer from three main problems in conventional networking paradigms as listed below:</p><p>1. They run into difficulties with encrypted traffic classification. 2. Privacy policies may limit access to the contents of the packets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Payload methods impose heavy computational overhead on communication systems</head><p>As a result of these difficulties, new traffic classification methods have been proposed to dispose the need for inspecting packets contents.  With the rapid increase in the number of DL models, researchers have recently investigated these models for traffic classification and consequently reported great accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Motivated by the DL models proliferation, we provided a comprehensive review of traffic classification works.</p><p>Due to the complexity and low accuracy of MLP networks, pure MLP implementation has rarely been employed for network traffic classification. Pure MLP suffers from the disadvantages that it needs to tune some hyper-parameters, such as the number of hidden neurons and layers and sensitivity to feature scaling. A combination of MLP with other DL methods and pure MLP has been studied in some works, including in <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>.</p><p>Aceto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> studied DL-based models for mobile traffic classification. They reproduced several DL classifiers, e.g., MLP, LSTM, CNN, and SAE, from the traffic classification literature in order to make a comprehensive evaluation for showing the accuracy of these classifiers. Among DL-based classifiers, the best performance is related to 1D-CNN with 76.37%/85.70% accuracy and the F-measure of 75.56%/78.78% on FB-FBM and Android dataset, respectively. The authors acknowledge the fact that classical ML algorithms that employ experts-and manually-based methods for feature extraction are not appropriate for modern networks due to: (1) handheld devices' massive deployment, such as smartphones and tablets, considerably increases mobile traffic to evaluate the models. The experimental results reveal the applicability of the evaluated models for smart home networks. More specifically, the average results of Precision, Recall and F1-Score on DataNet dataset are MLP = 0.9657%, 0.9653%, and 0.9653%, SAE = 0.9883% 0.9881%, and 0.9882%, CNN = 0.9847%, 0.9842%, and 0.9843%, respectively. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> focused on media traffic classification through DL. They applied CNN and MLP methods to classify four types of media traffic, i.e., video, audio, image, and text. According to the results, MLP shows good performance in terms of accuracy (0.9983%) and training time (0.019 s) under different scenarios.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>, IDS is considered by Ferreira and Shinoda since intrusion detection is a serious challenge in the context of NTMA. The authors introduced a new intrusion detection dataset and employed several traffic classification algorithms, such as MLP, J48, and Bayesian networks, to evaluate the dataset. Similarly, works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> proposed to use an MLP for traffic classification in IDS.</p><p>Despite difficulties with using pure MLP, some works use this model for traffic classification. For example, in <ref type="bibr">[</ref> networks as a classification tool to detect misappropriation attacks in Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. The authors claim that the proposed method can also find the nodes affected by the attack and determine the malicious nodes. The pure MLP model has also been adopted in the context of IDS. Wang et al. used the MLP network in combination with the sequential feature selection technique in order to detect distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. They utilized these techniques to select the optimal features during the training phase. Moreover, to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology (≈ 98% accuracy), they compared it with some papers in the literature.</p><p>As mentioned, one of the main advantages of CNNs compared to conventional neural networks is the automatic detection of the important features and hierarchical feature extraction. A simple CNN model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> for the categorization of encrypted traffic. This paper is one of the first works leveraging CNNs in the context of traffic classification, in which encrypted traffic is transformed into two-dimensional images, and then the images fed into the CNN model to be classified. The authors reported an accuracy of 1D-CNN = 1%, 82%, 98%, and 86%, and 2D-CNN = 1%, 80%, 97%, and 84% for four different experiments, respectively. The main advantages of the method presented in this work over the existing traffic classifiers, such as classical ML classifiers, include (1) integrating feature extraction/selection/classification phases into an end-to-end framework; (2) categorization of the encrypted network traffic which is a challenging task for the traditional classifiers. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, the authors also adopted the CNN model for IP traffic classification. They converted sequences into images that fully represent the patterns of different applications, such as Facebook and Instagram. Then, the CNN model is employed to classify the images to different applications. Rezaei and Liu proposed a one-dimensional CNN-based semi-supervised approach to categorize five Google applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. To reduce the need for large labeled traffic datasets, first, the model is pre-trained on a big unlabeled training test where the time series characteristics of a few samples of packets are considered as the input. The proposed method's performance is evaluated with different sampling techniques (i.e., fixed step sampling, random sampling, and incremental sampling) on three different datasets, including the QUIC dataset, Unlabeled Waikato dataset, and Ariel dataset. The proposed pre-trained method achieved higher accuracy than its non-pre-trained counterpart, with 81.50%, 81.27%, and 80.76% on the QUIC dataset for the sampling techniques. As mentioned, the authors use a 1D-CNN as a classifier because they believe the using of new applications and network encryption techniques have considerably raised the complexity of the traffic classification tasks, mainly when one uses classical ML-based methods.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, a novel IDS, namely, HAST-IDS, is proposed, in which CNN and LSTM models are used to learn the low-level features of spatial information of network traffic and high-level features of temporal information, respectively. No feature engineering phase is used in the proposed system since the deep neural models automatically learn the key features. To measure the effectiveness of the system, DARPA1998 and ISCX2012 datasets have been used by the authors, where HAST-IDS outperformed its competitions in terms of training and testing time and accuracy in both datasets. For example, in the DARPA1998 dataset, the training and testing time is 58 min and 1.7 min, respectively, and accuracy on the ISCX2012 dataset is ≈ 99.5%. Yeo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> applied CNN to malware detection tasks in an automated fashion. The authors claim that the introduced method can detect malware that uses unpredictable port numbers and protocols. This is mainly due to the fact that the model employs 35 different features captured from the packet flow, instead of features extracted from packets such as the port numbers and protocols. Besides, conventional networks have been used as traffic classifiers in IoT networks, where traffic classification can help distinguish between traffic/behavior of heterogeneous devices and services in these networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. In this work, the authors combined CNN and RNN models to achieve the best detection results, around 97% accuracy when they use all features. The proposed method shows excellent performance in terms of detection scores, even under a highly unbalanced dataset. Compared to the classical ML techniques, the proposed DL models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> do not need to go through the feature engineering phase thanks to the convolutional layers that extract complex features automatically from the input data.</p><p>Tong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref> provided the novel traffic classification based on CNN to categorize QUIC protocol traffic. They focus on the networks that use Google's QUIC protocol since the traffic generated by such systems imposes several challenges for traffic classification tasks because this protocol decreases network traffic visibility. As a result, port-and payload-based traffic classification methods cannot be used for QUIC-based communications. To deal with this problem, CNN has been proposed, utilizing the flow-and packet-based features for further improvement. CNNs have also been adopted for malware traffic classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. In this work, first, the network traffic is transformed into two-dimensional images. The convolutional network is then used to classify these images into different categories, such as Skype, FTP, and Outlook, , and the authors reported the average accuracy of 99.41%. Despite the advantages of the proposed method, the authors highlighted some limitations of their work, including (1) the size of the used dataset and classes number are fixed, while in the real-world use cases is not undoubtedly true, (2) the proposed method only utilized network traffic spatial features, while classical ML-based classification methods utilize different temporal features and show high accuracy.</p><p>For network traffic classification, RNN models are usually used with other DL models. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, both the RNN and CNN models are used for traffic classification. Different DL models are implemented in this work, where a particular combination of CNN/RNN achieved the highest degree of accuracy. Radford et al. proposed a creative method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref> for network anomaly detection through RNN. They converted network flow into sequences of words that form sentences, then these sentences are considered as the language model of a specific network. RNN is used to identify network activities that are malicious with respect to the model.</p><p>Auto-encoders are mainly used as an unsupervised technique to do automatic feature extraction and selection. More specifically, the output of the encoding part of an AE network can be used as a high-level set of discriminative features for a classification problem. Auto-encoders models have also been applied to classification problems, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> Lotfollahi et al. adopted an Stacked Autoencoders (SAE) model, called Deep Packet, for encrypted traffic classification. The SAE stacks several AEs to form a deep structure to obtain a better performance. The authors used the UNB ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to assess the performance of the introduced method. Deep Packet outperformed all of the introduced and compared classification methods on the used dataset, including two classical ML algorithms, i.e., k-NN and C4.5, an accuracy of 0.98% is compared to 0.94% and 0.90%, respectively. Moreover, given the increasing interactions between different components on the Internet and, consequently, the network's considerable complexity and diversity, DL algorithms are necessary to perform traffic classification tasks. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>, Zhao et al. deployed AE to extract and aggregate features from traffic data. Then, they used the n-gram embedding strategy and k-means clustering to classify unknown traffic, i.e., network traffic generated by previously unknown applications or services. The authors have targeted network flow classification in <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>. They proposed an improved SAE, in which several basic Bayesian auto-encoders are stacked to understand the complex relations between the multi-source network flows. Moreover, the proposed SAE is trained through the back-propagation learning algorithm and in a supervised learning manner in order to learn the complex relations between the network flows. The simulation results show the improved SAE outperforms its ancestor in terms of accuracy (83.2 percent accuracy versus 82.9 percent). Last but not least, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref> a comparison between the classical machine learning classification method and the DL method, i.e., SAE, has been made. The experiments revealed that DL model provides better accuracy (with 99.20%) than the classical ML model (with 95.22%). Furthermore, the authors claimed that in highly distributed networks, such as IoT systems, the traditional techniques such as classical ML techniques for NTMA purposes (e.g., attack detection) have less scalability. As a result, they proposed edge-based deep learning to deal with modern communication systems' distributed and complex nature. The vast amount of data generated by IoT edge devices allow DL models to learn more useful than classical ML models.</p><p>In the context of network traffic classification, deep generative models can be used to deal with the imbalanced dataset problem. An imbalanced dataset refers to the situation in which the number of instances available for different data classes is considerably different. In such situations, predicting the classes with few instances is usually challenging for classical ML models. To alleviate this problem, oversampling and undersampling are two frequent and easy techniques. In the former, oversampling can be realized through duplicating instances of minor label classes, whereas by deleting some instances from major classes, one can implement an undersampling technique. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>, a deep generative model, namely Auxiliary Classifier GANs (AC-GAN), is proposed to address the problem of imbalanced classes of network data. More precisely, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been deployed for the generation of synthesized data instances to create a balance between the minor and the major label classes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, Alom et al. used Deep Belief Neural Network (DBNN), a well known generative model, for intrusion detection. Furthermore, they compared the proposed method with some existing methods, such as SVM and DBNN-SBM. The proposed methods outperformed all these methods in terms of classification accuracy by achieving ≈ 97% accuracy. The authors announced that their method is not only able to detect threats, but also categorize them in five classes with the accuracy of detection. Another advantage of the provided DL model is that it can detect any unknown attack that has not been considered in the training dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">DL for network traffic prediction</head><p>Network Traffic Prediction (NTP) refers to the understanding of the future status of links in a network. Network traffic prediction and modeling are two key metrics to measure telecommunications systems' performance as they attract much attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. In the context of cellular networks, making an accurate prediction on the dynamic of cellular network traffic is a key step towards improving network performance. Considering the rapid evolution towards deployment of the 5G cellular networks, the telecommunication systems and networks are expected to be more intelligent and self-organized <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. A Selforganizing Network (SON) had to adapt itself to dynamic patterns of usage and perform preemptive actions for planning, configuration, management, and optimization of the network. Towards this end, prediction and understanding of the future of dynamicity of the mobile traffic is crucially important to support smart and automated management features <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>.</p><p>From the point of view of an IoT service provider, traffic prediction is highly valuable since it can provide information on the probability distribution of IoT devices connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The information can be used to prepare the software and hardware infrastructures needed to minimize the risk of interruption of extremely significant services and related devices. Moreover, it is highly useful to know in advance the status of IoT devices connectivity in order to decline the impact of possible connectivity congestion in a network.</p><p>In recent years, it is becoming more and more apparent that NTP is a challenging task. The volume of mobile data traffic has experienced an enormous increase in the last few decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>. In addition, technological advances in the field of communication systems and networking lead to a proliferation of the number of devices connecting to the cellular network, as well as emerging social networks such as Instagram and Facebook have further added to the network traffic volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. For example, Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> demonstrate that a considerable portion of mobile traffic is unpredictably random. They analyze the traffic patterns of more than 9000 Base Stations (BSs) in a metropolitan area. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>, some challenges for ML in network traffic prediction, such as data acquisition, class imbalance, concept drift, and big data setting, have been listed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>, significant spatial and temporal variations in cellular network traffic are referred to as a severe challenge to accurate cellular traffic prediction. Despite all the difficulties mentioned above, various methods for NTP have been proposed in the literature. Generally, one can categorize them into two main groups, including classic prediction methods (e.g., ARMA) and ML-based methods. The most commonly adopted linear methods are ARIMA/SARIMA models and HoltWinters algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>. Whereas, the most commonly used non-linear methods are traditional and deep neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>. The performance of different linear methods such as ARMA, ARIMA, and HoltWinters and non-linear methods such as traditional neural networks were investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">122]</ref>. In the majority of cases, the non-linear methods have performed better than linear methods. Broadly speaking, the best prediction technique can be selected based on considering some measurement factors, such as computational cost, lower mean error, and characteristics of the traffic matrix to name a few. One of the serious limitations of linear methods (e.g., ARIMA) is their low robustness to the sudden changes of the time-series. This is due to the fact that the model tends to over recreate the average of the previously observed instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Adding new services or unforeseen changes in the current service settings (e.g., the running of new bandwidth-hungry use cases) presents significant challenges to these methods. Moreover, these methods provide poor performance with non-homogeneous time-series, where the input and the prediction are not within the same set of data points.</p><p>DL has been used successfully in many use cases, such as visual recognition and Spatio-temporal forecasting problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>, as well as is considered as one of the most cutting edge achievements in AI. Different types of DL models have been applied in the context of NTP, e.g. CNNs and RNN in cellular networks to capture spatial and temporal properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. In the following, the state-of-the-art DL models for traffic prediction are reviewed.</p><p>Azari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> provided a comparative evaluation of LSTM and ARIMA. They studied the effect of different parameters on the models on the effectiveness of the predictions. Their simulation results prove the superiority of LSTM over ARIMA, particularly when the training time series is long enough. Nevertheless, in some scenarios, ARIMA gives performance near the optimal with a lower level of complexity. In a similar way, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>, authors made a comparison between three well-known traffic prediction models, i.e., RNN, ARIMA, and Wavelet Transform (DWT). They referred to this fact that NTP is very helpful for many applications, such as congestion control, anomaly detection, and bandwidth allocation. Andreoletti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref> proposed a novel method for traffic forecasting through Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN). They employed DCRNN to predict the amount of expected traffic and to forecast network congestion. In addition, the authors compared the proposed method with other famous methods,  The authors provided the remarkable insight that it is not straightforward to use classical ML algorithms for NTP. This is mainly due to the fact that classical ML algorithms are adopted to be used for data in the Euclidean space, while the data in communication systems and networks are usually graph-structured data. Hence, they deployed DCRNN as a graph-based DL algorithm for the NTC task.</p><p>One of the DL models, gaining the reputation to learn long-range dependencies time series is LSTM. Today, studies and applications of LSTM for time series forecasting in the context of communication systems and networks are proliferating. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, the authors used LSTM to model and predict Spatio-temporal data in cellular networks. This paper directly challenged Support Vector Regression (SVR) and ARIMA as two widespread methods for time-series prediction. The paper reveals that ARIMA is not a useful technique for NTP due to its bias to concentrate on the historical data's mean values, making it powerless to catch the fast variational underlying network traffic data. Regarding the SVR, it refers to this fact that one has to determine the different model's parameters. Simultaneously, there is no structured method for selecting the most suitable values of the parameters.</p><p>Fen et al. addressed the cellular traffic prediction task through a deep traffic prediction, called DeepTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>. DeepTP comprises two primary components: a feature extractor to model spatial dependencies of cellular traffic, encode the external related information, and a sequential module for modeling important temporal changes. The authors reported that DeepTP outperforms the latest methods of traffic forecasting by more than 12.31%. The authors used DL to solve the cellular traffic prediction problem as they argue that the performance of available techniques is still low because of the following difficulties: (1) complex temporal variations in the network traffic, e.g., traffic burstiness, (2) dependencies to different impact components such as daytime and day of the week, and (3) spatial dependencies caused by user mobility. Motivated by the importance of traffic prediction to telecommunication providers in order to manage their resources in an efficient and futuristic manner, Dalgkitsis et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref> also introduced an LSTM-based approach for traffic prediction in cellular networks. They compared the proposed technique with different prediction methods, such as RBF, ARIMA, and SARIMAX. The proposed method shows more outstanding performance than other methods in terms of prediction error. The MSE achieved by LSTM = 1.685, SARIMAX = 11.26, ARIMA = 6.53, and RBF = 3.24.</p><p>Fang et al. investigated one of the big problems in cellular networks, i.e., per-cell demand forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>. The authors referred to the fact that the nonuniform spatial distribution of cells poses a serious challenge towards the modeling of spatial relevancy, mostly when one employs the neural networks that accept the grid-based input data. The authors used the dependency graph based on convolutional networks and LSTM to model the spatial dependence among cells to address this problem. The convolutional networks are responsible for modeling traffic data's spatial features, whereas the LSTM can model temporal aspects. Zhang and Patras focused on traffic prediction in mobile networks through DL <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>. This paper proposed a Spatiotemporal neural network architecture based on CNN and LSTM models to forecast cellular traffic in dense urban areas, where there is extreme spatio-temporal variability in mobile traffic because of the mobility of users. One of the main advantages of the proposed architecture is that it only needs a small number of ground truth samples. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed method's provides better performance than its counterpart in terms of prediction error in different prediction durations or steps. Under 1-step setting, For example, the proposed method achieved a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.19, while this figure for ARIMA = 0.20, MLP = 0.23, SVM = 0.39, and AE + LSTM = 0.24.</p><p>One of the less-investigated DL models in the field of NTP is SAE. One of the first works of the traffic prediction through SAE is conducted by Oliveira et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>. They employed and compared two DL models, i.e., MLP and SAE, for the Internet traffic prediction. To evaluate their models, they use real traffic data that indicate that the proposed models are able to cope with complex traffic flow prediction tasks with reasonable accuracy and effectiveness. Another advantage of using the SAE is the unsupervised training nature of this DL model. Besides, compared to the classical ML algorithms, DL algorithms support adding considerable complexity to the prediction model due to several data representation layers. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, a new deep technique based on auto-encoder is proposed for spatial modeling. Also, in this paper, LSTM is used to model temporal information. The auto-encoder model comprises of a Global Stacked AutoEncoder (GSAE) and several Local SAEs. The main idea behind using multiple SAEs is that they can provide better representations of input data and decline the model size. Bega et al. proposed DeepCog, as a DL-based data analytics tool for traffic forecasting in network slicing <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>. The main objective of DeepCog is to predict the respective resource demands for each slice for resource allocation purposes. DeepCog takes benefit from a DL architecture specifically established to predict a network slice's future needed capacity. The architecture comprises two main modules, including encoder and decoder. The encoder accepts the cellular traffic data as input and then maps spatial/temporal features of data onto a lowdimensional space. Then, the decoder processes this low-dimensional data representation to produce the ultimate slice capacity prediction. Furthermore, similar work has been conducted by the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>, where they proposed AZTEC, a framework for automatic allocation of capacity to different network slices. The proposed framework utilizes DL architectures (CNNs) and a traditional numerical optimization algorithm to provide the best performance, i.e., minimizing management's costs.</p><p>DL models demonstrate remarkable ability to capture the complex and non-linear dependence hidden in wireless communications and raised as the biggest competitors to classical linear models in traffic forecasting. Among DL models, CNN is one of the most powerful ones that has been successfully used in a wide range of applications, such as computer vision and NLP, and traffic prediction is no exception. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref> introduced a novel approach for citywide traffic prediction through CNN. More specifically, they employed CNN for modeling the spatial and temporal dependence of traffic in different network cells. While many studies have been conducted to examine the dynamic characteristics of mobile network traffic (e.g., ARIMA and ML), the pattern of mobile network traffic is too complicated because of the different factors (e.g., UEs mobility and diversity). As a result, it soon becomes evident that these linear models did not work in such a complex network, and adopting novel models based on DL is necessary. Work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> targeted network traffic forecasting in data centers by gated recurrent unit (GRU) model and interactive temporal recurrent convolution network (ITRCN) model. CNN is a part of the ITRCN model that is responsible for learning network traffic in the form of images to discover the network-wide services' correlations. To evaluate the performance of their method, authors used datasets from Yahoo and the results of experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over GRU and CNN by 13.0% and 14.3% in RMSE, respectively. Motivated by the potential applications of traffic prediction in network planning and routing configurations, and consequently, QoS for users, Nie et al. developed a network traffic prediction approach based on DBNN and spatiotemporal compressive sensing technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>. They first used a discrete wavelet transform in order to extract the lowpass component of network traffic, and then DBNN is adopted as a prediction model to categorize network traffic.</p><p>The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref> proposed an attention-based convolutional network to forecast of wireless network traffic, called LA-ResNet. Their method can involve both the temporal and spatial features of traffic in the prediction process. To extract spatial characteristics of the traffic, they use a residual network, where RNN is deployed to capture temporal features. The RMSE calculated for the proposed method and its well-known counterparts, including 3DCNN (5.02), ARIMA (7.98), LSTM (6.12), GRU (6.48), and CNN + RNN (11.03), showed the superiority of the proposed method (4.5).</p><p>Wan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref> conducted a detailed investigation into cellular network traffic in large-scale deployments. In their paper, the authors first provide a useful insight into cellular traffic in large cities, temporal/spatial dynamics of cellular traffic in such environments, and the source causes of these dynamics. They also deployed a graph-based DL method for cellular traffic forecasting. The simulation result reveals the superiority of the proposed method over time-series based techniques. The paper's novelty is that the authors modeled the spatial/temporal features of cellular traffic in an urban area employing a directed graph. Then, they used a graph-based DL model that can learn from the modeled graph.</p><p>A summary of the papers reviewed in this section is provided in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">DL for fault management</head><p>Fault management refers to the group of tasks to detect, isolate, and then correct abnormal situations of a network. It also includes any operations needed to determine the source of an abnormal situation, also called failure. Failure happens when a network cannot successfully offer a service, where a fault is the root cause of a failure. In traditional communication systems and networks, link and node failures are the most common type of failures, and faults are mostly related to software bugs (e.g., failed web service) or hardware-related crashes (e.g., routers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>.</p><p>Fault management plays a crucial role in today's network management procedure. The recent rapid growth of interests in IoT and the proliferation of mobile devices has further strengthened the importance of fault management. Faults in communication systems and networks are no exception and tend to happen more frequently. Along with common network faults, recently trendy phenomena, such as IoT and the Internet of Everything (IoE), have to cope with faults related to unreliable hardware, limited battery life, connectivity failure, harsh environmental condition, etc. Hence, in order to guarantee QoS and high performance in communication systems and networks, fault detection and performing immediate and effective actions to heal and recover the systems from failure are crucially important. A set of functions and a cyclic of the process are introduced specifically for this purpose that categorized under the umbrella of fault management systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In the context of cellular networks, high demands, and the everincreasing dependency of people on these networks are the primary motivations for designing better fault management systems. Nowadays, cellular networks have become an essential part of the communication infrastructures, where users can use their mobile device anytime and almost everywhere. This makes fault management as one of the central aspects of network management in the context of cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the importance of fault management, there are some difficulties in realizing an effective fault management system. For example, IoT sensors and some IoT devices usually have limited resources of power, like a battery. It is expected that these smart physical objects operate autonomously on their environment for some periods of time, ranging from days to years. Moreover, these objects may not be easily accessible to change their batteries since IoT devices may be deployed in specific locations, such as forests and volcanic areas. Because of these reasons, faults may happen more frequently and unexpectedly in IoT networks than conventional networks. Besides, although the distributed nature of communication systems and networks brings scalability and resiliency to failures, it makes it challenging to perform fault management for such complex systems both due to the handling a substantial number of devices and also due to the different vendor-specific characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">141]</ref>.</p><p>Fault management can be considered as a cyclic process, i.e., operates on a continuous cycle and actively seeks for abnormal conditions on a network. Although every fault management system may have different steps, the general fault management cycle includes fault detection, localization (or fault diagnosis), and mitigation (or fault resolving) steps. First, a fault management system examines the network and discovers one or more failures that affect the network's performance. As instances of fault, one may refer to filled switch capacity, disabled link, and disabled switch <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>. The next step in the fault management cycle is to localize the source of fault (s). This step calls for determining the physical location of the fault (s) on the network and pinpointing the reason for the fault (s). Furthermore, finally, fault mitigation attempts to repair or fix the network fault (is). This step may performed in an automatic or manual way.</p><p>Fault prediction is another important concept in the context of fault management and aims to prevent network failures by forecasting them and establishing resolving procedures in order to minimize the negative effects of the failures. DL-based approaches have been introduced to deal with these challenges and improve functionality in the steps mentioned above. Addressing complex problems is one of the key advantages of ML, especially deep learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>. Regarding the everincreasing amount of traffic in communication systems and networks, using DL models to analyze such a massive amount of traffic is a promising technique to produce helpful insights for fault management. In the following, the DL models that have been proposed for these significant challenges for fault management are reviewed.</p><p>Huang et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref> first reviewed fault detection mechanisms in IoT systems and then proposed a fault-detection architecture for Self-Driving Network (SelfDN)-enabled IoT. Towards this end, they also introduced an algorithm, namely, Gaussian Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines auto-encoder (GBRBM-DAE) in order to convert the fault-detection task into a classification task. The result of experiments reveals that the provided algorithm shows better detection accuracy (82.95%) than the other commonly used ML algorithms, such as SVM (77.4%), linear regression (64.9%), quadratic discriminant analysis (64.8%), and linear discriminant analysis (68.9%). The authors discussed this exciting point that IoT devices produce a massive amount of data at the edge of the network, which causes a high computational load for online processing in edge servers. As a result, using classification techniques based on the traditional ML models is ineffective or almost incapable. DL techniques can process a massive amount of data with a large number of features without the need for a hand-engineered data preprocessing phase and engineering techniques. Mulvey et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref> targeted the sleeping cell problem in the cellular networks through DL techniques. More specifically, they adopted RNN to diagnose cell radio performance degradation and complete cell outages in a cellular network. The proposed method achieves greater sensitivity than traditional ML-based techniques, e.g., SVM, while reducing the demand for some preprocessing phases such as dimensionality reduction. Masood et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref> provided an auto-encoder-based framework for self-governed detection of sleeping cells in mobile networks. Sleeping addition, network self-healing is a novel concept in the area of network fault management. Self-healing is a subset of SON, and it refers to resolving issues in cellular networks such as cell outages, without the need for human interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>. A combination of self-healing and cutting-edge DL algorithms can be used to forecast failures in advance. Such insight is beneficial due to the fact that it allows us to perform preventive operations and consequently lower unexpected costs and maintain the acceptable level of QoS.</p><p>System failure forecasting in mission-critical IT environments has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref> by Zhang et al. The authors criticized the current system management mechanisms for being labor-intensive, mainly when they utilize logs records. Moreover, they recognized that automated mechanisms based on text mining methods result in a highdimensional feature space. To deal with these challenges, they proposed an automatic mechanism capable of parsing logs record in order to forecast system failures in IT systems. To lower the feature space's dimensionality, they first cluster the logs and then consider each cluster as a word. Besides, as the number of labeled samples is usually rare in such systems, they adopted an LSTM model to alleviate this issue. The LSTM can notably capture the long-term dependency over sequences.</p><p>A summary of the works reviewed in this section is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">DL for network security</head><p>Communication systems and networks have ever-increasing impacts on people's lives, making cybersecurity a significant research area. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>, cybersecurity refers to the sets of policies, approaches, technologies, and processes that closely collaborate to guard computer systems, networks, programs, and data from attack, unauthorized access, and malicious changes. Cyber-defense tools mostly include firewalls, anti-virus software, and IDS. These tools are aimed at protecting communication systems and networks from internal and external threats. IDS is one of the underlying mechanisms for preventing attacks and detecting security breaches in networks.</p><p>During the past decades, there have been considerable efforts in academia and industry to enable communication systems and networks in order to respond to rapidly increasing demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">157]</ref>. New International Telecommunications Union (ITU) statistics show that at the end of 2019, the number of Internet users has reached 53.6% of the global population, or 4.1 billion people <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref>. At the same time, according to the report in <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>, cyberattacks are increasing in size, sophistication, and cost. For example, it is expected that cyberattacks will lose about 6$ trillion annually by 2021 in the world. Thus, it is crucially important to strengthen the security of communication systems and networks against cyber threats, particularly due to the fact that people become increasingly dependent on wireless networks, such as cellular networks and WiFi for everyday life activities (e.g., online shopping, online banking, and the Internet-based business).</p><p>As mentioned, IDS are underlying mechanisms for providing security of communication systems and networks. An IDS is a hardware tool or software program that monitors a network/systems for malicious activities, attacks, violations of the security policies, etc. Many different types of IDS can be used to aid the security of networks. However, based on intrusive behaviors, network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) are the most widespread ones. Network IDS either are hardware-or softwarebased systems, which can be placed on different network mediums such as Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) and switches in order to inspect and analyze network traffic to protect a system from attacks and possible threats. One can classify network IDS works into two major categories, namely, misuse and anomaly detection. Misuse detection methods, also called signature-based, allow detecting previously known attacks through matching the signatures of these attacks with the analyzed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. In contrast, anomaly detection methods aim to distinguish abnormal traffic patterns from normal ones by monitoring the network data. On the other hand, host IDS refers to the systems which use network behavior through the different log files on the local host computer to identify attacks. Host IDS is more focused on detecting internal attacks, e.g., file permission changes. Malware and botnet detection are the two most prevalent categories of host IDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Malware detection is a technique that its objective is to protect the system by detecting malicious behavior. A botnet is a special type of malware that consists of a large number of bots and may use for malicious activities such as DDoS attacks. A graphical description of IDS techniques is provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>.</p><p>When it comes to applying the deep learning for security in communication systems and networks, we have realized that a considerable number of studies in the literature have focused on the application of DL for intrusion and anomaly detection. In the sequel, we present a literature review of DL-based techniques for cybersecurity applications, and we classify the papers into two main categories, namely, network IDS (misuse detection and anomaly detection) and host IDS (malware detection and botnet detection).</p><p>The use of DL seems to be widespread for network security, especially for network IDS. For example, Papamartzivanos et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref> proposed a self-adaptive and autonomous misuse detection system based on DL. In this work, AE and sparse AE is used as a part of the proposed system, in which the authors combined self-taught learning and MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) frameworks to provide a scalable, self-adaptive and autonomous misuse IDS. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 77.99%, compared to 59.71% accuracy acquired by the static technique. Given the massive scale of modern communication systems and networks and the complexity of big traffic data, the IDS task surpasses the limits of traditional techniques capabilities, such as classical ML. Jiang et al. provided a virtual MAC spoofing detection technique by means of a convolutional network for the environments that use virtualization technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. In this work, CNN has been utilized to derive physical features from channel state information (gathered from packet transmissions) order to catch virtual MAC spoofing attacks.</p><p>Naseer et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref> investigated the applicability of DL models for anomaly detection systems. Towards this end, they proposed different DL-based anomaly detection methods, including CNN, AE, and RNN, as well as classical ML models such as the nearest neighbor, decisiontree, random-forest, and SVM. They used NSLKDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref> dataset for evaluation of the proposed methods. The simulation results reveal the suitability of the DL-based anomaly method for real-world applications. The authors stated that the paper's main objective is to examine DL models' suitability for anomaly detection purposes compared to the shallow models. DL models give better performance regarding different classification metrics (e.g., accuracy and precision) than shallow models. However, DL models spend more time on training and test purposes than shallow models. Similarly, Malaiya et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref> examined the anomaly detection techniques based on DL. They implement different DL models, including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs), Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), and Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) for this purpose. Moreover, the authors referred to this fact that non-linearity in network traffic data is one of the main reasons that challenge the classical ML techniques (e.g., SVM) for the anomaly detection task. Anomaly detection in cloud data-center networks is targeted by the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref>. They employed the Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm and CNN for anomaly detection. The authors claimed that their method is suitable for analyzing the network log big data for realtime anomaly detection. DARPA'98, KDD'99, and synthetic datasets are used to evaluate the efficacy of the introduced approach, which  <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref> to perform anomaly detection and attack categorization tasks in the IEEE 802.11 network. To this end, the author first investigated the threats and attacks in the IEEE 802.11 network and then listed the challenges in gaining high accuracy in threat/attack classification in this network type. Finally, a DL approach based on SAE is proposed for anomaly detection/classification. The proposed method is able to learn the key features of data by itself and achieve an accuracy of 98.66%.</p><p>Chen et al. discussed security in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) when used in transportation system applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref>. The main reason behind this study is that the volume of communications has substantially risen among the connected edge devices. Hence, communication security is arising as a severe challenge. To address this challenge, the authors proposed a method for feature learning based on a deep belief network to identify unknown attacks in MEC. The proposed method is compared with the other four classical ML algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Softmax Regression, and SVM, outperforming them in accuracy. Similarly, Nguyen et al. focused on Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) security issues, such as availability of services, data integrity, and users' privacy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref>. To this end, they adopted a preventive method based on DL to detect and isolate cyberattacks in MCC. In the paper, a Gaussian Binary Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GRBM) network is used for learning purposes, and NSL-KDD/UNSW-NB15/KDDcup is utilized for evaluating the proposed method. The experiment result shows the superiority of the proposed method over nine classical ML algorithms, including Decision Tree, K-means, K-NN, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and SVM by 2%-16% in accuracy. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref> developed a IDS for Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref> based on DL. More specifically, the authors in this work leveraged deep GANs and distributed SDN in order to develop a collaborative IDS for VANETs. They claim that the proposed method can detect abnormal behaviors in the entire network, unlike the traditional methods that can detect only abnormal activities in local sub-networks. Moreover, they evaluate their method's performance under both independent identically distributed (IID) and non-IID scenarios. For example, on NSL-KDD and the KDD99 dataset and IID scenario, they achieved 0.951%-0.977% and 0.977%-0.984% accuracy under different settings, respectively.</p><p>Malware detection is an essential class of host IDS because malware (short for malicious software) can significantly impact a huge number of connected devices. Viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, bots, rootkits, and ransomware are prominent types of malware. Since the number and variety of malware are increasing, malware detection techniques need to be improved to protect communication systems and networks. To that end, DL-based Malware Detection Systems (MDSs) are promising techniques to deal with sophisticated malware attacks. For example, Zhong and Gu <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref> proposed a multi-level DL-based system for malware detection to further enhance the performance of DL-based MDSs in terms of scalability and handling more complex data distributions of malware datasets. The authors adopted three DL models (i.e., CNN, LSTM, and RNN) as three structures of their systems. Each model is responsible for learning a specific data distribution of a particular class of malware. The authors compared the proposed method's performance (i.e., accuracy) with other methods such as ensemble DL, single CNN and RNN, SVM, and decision tree. The results demonstrate the supremacy of the provided system relative to its counterparts. Hardy et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[174]</ref> designed a DL architecture based on the SAEs model to detect malware intelligently. In this architecture, the SAEs performed as greedy layer-wise unsupervised pre-training operation, and then the supervised parameter fine-tuning idea is used to decline the error of prediction. The results indicate that the proposed architecture is able to improve the overall performance of malware detection by providing 0.956% accuracy. In other words, although shallow learning methods such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and decision tree provide excellent results in terms of accuracy, yet disappointing for malware detection tasks to some degree. Hence, the DL has been proposed to tackle this concern. Authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[175]</ref> introduced a technique to detect Internet Of Battlefield Things (IoBT) malware by Operational Code (OpCode) sequence and deep Eigenspace learning. They transformed OpCodes into a vector space and then and adopt deep Eigenspace learning to categorize malware. The authors declared that their method is robust and sustainable against malicious and benign applications.</p><p>Last but not least, botnet detection is another important class of host IDS. A botnet is a network of Internet-connected computers infected by bots. The bots are able to communicate with the attacker, also known as a botmaster. Botnets can be used to perform a wide range of subversive activities, such as DDoS attacks, send spam, click fraud, and bitcoin mining, to name a few. Different botnet detection approaches have been used in literature that are mostly based on passive monitoring of the network traffic. These approaches typically use ML algorithms to categorize network traffic and mainly depend on feature engineering and feature selection. ML-based methods need hard effort and domain knowledge to extract high-level network traffic patterns and the most relevant features. DL alleviates this problem as DL algorithms are able to automatically detect the important features and hierarchically extract features. As a result, DL has gained lots of interest in recent years for botnet detection purposes. For example, Roosmalen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref> apply DL on packet flows to detect botnet traffic. More specifically, they use flows of TCP/UDP/IP-packets as inputs for a stacked denoising auto-encoders (SDAs) network to extract traffic features automatically, and then feed-forward supervised DNN is used for fine-tuning. Therefore, the proposed method does not need a feature engineering or a feature selection phase. The authors achieve a P2P-botnet detection accuracy of 99.7%. Pektas and Acarman <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref> combine CNN and LSTM to detect botnets. The proposed approach consists of three phases, including feature extraction, building model, and evaluation phase. In this approach, network flows are used as the input in the first phase. Moreover, the authors use two datasets publicly available to evaluate their method, which achieves a classification accuracy of 99%. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref> targets IoT-based botnet attacks. To be specific, the authors in this work deploy deep auto-encoders for botnet attacks detection. Unlike previous papers on IoT botnets detection, the authors use real IoT traffic data to evaluate their method. The IoT traffic data is collected from multiple commercial IoT devices infected by botnets. Analysis of results demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method for IoT botnets detection. The work of Torres et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref> performed an analysis of RNNs for botnet detection. They first referred to these facts that traditional botnet detection techniques are not efficient because botnets continually evolve and the behavioral analysis-based techniques are more applicable in modern communication systems. As a result, they assessed the viability of network traffic behavior recognition through RNN. During the performance evaluation of the RNN, the authors considered two common issues in such problems, i.e., imbalance network data and optimal length of sequences. The simulation results reveal that the RNN can categorize the network traffic with a high accuracy rate and a low false alarm rate.</p><p>A summary of the works reviewed in this section is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Future direction and open issues</head><p>In this section, we discuss future direction and open issues based on our findings after the literature review in terms of using DL in NTMA.</p><p>1. Lack of labeled data: The success of ML techniques especially DL algorithms, highly depends on the quality and quantity of the data used for training. Applying DL-based techniques for building prediction models in NTMA, calls for having huge amounts of network traffic. Although dramatic advances in communication systems and networks, such as IoT and 5G, lead to the production of massive volume of raw data every day, data labeling is a costly task in terms of time, computational overhead, and human effort. In real-world applications of networking, most of the data is unlabeled or semi-labeled <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Integrating DL techniques with other ML techniques that are able to work with unlabeled or semi-labeled data can be considered as a great solution.</p><p>Active Learning has received much attention in addressing the challenge of labeling data <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>.</p><p>2. Difficulties in using DL for structured data: Structured data refers to a standardized format that organizes data in tables with rows and columns, e.g., network traffic data. However, the most initial and successful applications of DL techniques are reported on problems with data that is unstructured, such as video, images, text, and audio. Some machine learning experts are against using DL for structured data because they believe that labeled structured datasets are not large enough for training DL algorithms. Moreover, they argue that classical ML algorithms, such as KNN and SVM, are much more simple and understandable than complex DL algorithms (e.g. GANs). Hence, they are the right choice for classical tasks, such as traffic classification and intrusion detection. Despite these objectives, one can refer to huge amounts of produced data by communication systems and networks that can be used for training DL algorithms but at the costs of labeling.</p><p>In addition, thanks to the popularity of DL models in different domains, multiple frameworks have been established to facilitate using of DL. As prime examples of DL frameworks, we can refer to TensorFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref>, PyTorch and Keras <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref>. 3. Lack of successful or full exploitation of DL in some NTMA applications: As is clear from Section 5.3, the lack of work on fault management is notable, and a considerable number of the reviewed papers have used DL for other tasks, such as network traffic classification and forecasting. However, the traditional methods for fault management, e.g. rule-based systems and algorithmic approaches suffer from serious disadvantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>. For example, in rule-based systems, network domain knowledge is needed to formulate and maintain the rule-sets; Or the functionalities of the algorithmic approaches are restricted to a specific problem area, and these approaches have to adopt a wide range of algorithms to support the complete problem space in the context of fault management. To overcome these disadvantages, one can exploit the capabilities of ML-based methods, especially DL for fault management. Specifically, ML-based methods can support a diverse range of problem areas, as well as eliminate the need for knowledge from domain experts through learning from fault data during the training phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[183,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">184]</ref>. 4. Resource-constrained networks: Most of DL algorithms are designed to be trained and used by devices with sufficient resources. Training a DL algorithm with a large number of training samples and parameters, requires resource-rich devices in terms of computation, memory and power. This is in direct contradiction to the growing interest in the deployment of resourceconstrained devices (e.g., IoT devices) equipped with AI-and learning-based technologies. The techniques in <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[185]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[186]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[187]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[188]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[189]</ref> have been proposed as ways to respond to this challenge. Regarding the enormous advances in the resource-constrained IoT devices and significant growth of the data produced at the edge of the network, it seems that the techniques based on federated learning will be more adaptive in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[186,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">188]</ref>. In federated learning, a device can use local data in order to participate in the training process through updating the current model downloaded from a cloud and then only send back this update (weights). This learning approach allows using DL algorithms in resource-constrained devices as the training data is distributed among all participant devices and they use a shared model. As a result, with limited power, memory, and computational resources the devices can achieve great performance. 5. Retraining challenge: Unlike other applications of ML, networking suffers from high dynamicity and consequently it needs to retrain the models to be adapted with the new situations in a network. In a network, models should be retrained frequently because of the following events: Torres et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref> Botnet detection RNN Analyzes the performance of RNN for botnet detection purposes through the behavioral analysis of network traffic.</p><p>Nguyen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref> Attacks detection in MCC GRBM Leverages the GRBM network to develop an attack detection method for mobile cloud environments.</p><p>Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref> Virtual MAC spoofing detection CNN Proposes a DL based detection system for MAC spooling attacks detection in virtualized environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Daily training</head><p>• To be adapted with the new changes upon network manager's requests • Triggered by detecting some events, e.g. security breaches, network behavior changes, or starting new packet streams.</p><p>Generally, DL models suffer from high complexity in the training phase as they consume plenty of resources and time. Most of the networking applications are time-consuming, thereby the time complexity of DL models to be retrained can be considered as a great challenge as DL models should be optimized in terms of time complexity and resource consumption. 6. Theory of network: In Internet Engineering Task Force 97 (IETF97), the challenge is introduced as networks suffer from the lack of a unified theory that can be applied to all networks. It means that the behavior of networks is heterogeneous based on their different topologies, equipment, scale, applications, etc. It causes an important problem that ML techniques should be trained for each network separately. The accuracy of ML techniques that are trained by public datasets can be reduced in different networks. There are some efforts to provide representative datasets, but it seems that the challenge increases the need for ML techniques that can label the data and re-train frequently for each network separately. Therefore, rather than public datasets, the DL techniques should be trained by exclusive datasets gathered from the target network and labeled with high accuracy. To solve this challenge, DL techniques should be learned for each network separately, but as mentioned above, retraining the DL models for each network is a time and resource consuming task.</p></div>

Wang et al. [82] also developed different DL-based traffic classifiers. Motivated by the recent advances in DL-based traffic classification and the weaknesses of the available traffic classification techniques, e.g., DPI, in giving real-time application awareness for encrypted network traffic, the authors used DL-based models, i.e., MLP, SAE, and CNN, to categorize traffic in the smart home use case.

Moreover, recent works propose to use temporal and spatial features of network traffic and network management data to obtain a finer insight into the complex pattern hidden in network traffic data<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. This is mainly because many applications and services are provided for specific locations, and thus temporal and spatial information is attached to the traffic data and network management data. • Noisy data: By noise, we mean any unwanted change reshapes the values of data. In the context of networking, noise may be created by some common events, caused by e.g. faults, attacks, etc. For example, in multi-hop routing in IoT networks, inefficient queuing management in middle nodes can cause jitter.</figDesc><table><row><cell>• High-speed rate and large-scale streaming data: One of the distin-</cell></row><row><cell>guishing characteristics of network traffic data is streaming and</cell></row><row><cell>high data rates, particularly in services such as streaming media,</cell></row><row><cell>P2P applications and live game streaming.

The authors reported that their approach shows higher detection accuracy than one-class SVM, with 99% accuracy compared to 94% accuracy provided by SVM. As mentioned, fault localization is the second step in the fault management cycle. Dusia et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref> provide a comprehensive survey on fault localization in computer networks. They reviewed the latest advances in fault localization techniques for communication networks as well as they discussed the fault localization in complex communication systems. Note, the main focus of the paper is not on DLbased approaches, whereas three major categories of fault localization methods, i.e., AI-based methods, model traversing and graph-theoretic methods, have been discussed in this study. Gupta et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref> proposed a hybrid framework, namely, HYPER-VINES, using classical ML and DL algorithms with a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning for detection and localization faults in Network Function Virtualization (NFV). The proposed framework is able to handle both fault detection and localization with a reasonable level of accuracy (&gt;95%). The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> use RNN in order to perform fault detection and localization in distributed systems (DS). To be more specific, they employed a two-dimensional CNN model in the form of a denoising AE along with RNN to simultaneously perform fault detection and diagnosis for a distributed system. The main reasons behind proposing DNNs for this problem consist in DNN models' ability to handle such systems' high dimensionality and uncertainty.</p><p>The last step in the fault management cycle is fault mitigation. Khunteta et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref> adopted a method based on DL for link failure mitigation in 5G networks. They used RNN models in order to continuously track Reference Signals Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) as signal conditions, consequently, predict and mitigate link failure events. The simulation results show that the proposed method can mitigate the failures with user equipment (UE) autonomous decisions in link failure events. Compared with statistical models such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Ngram model, DL models (e.g., LSTM) show better performance for predicting future failures due to their better data representation ability utilizing various features effectively. The proposed LSTM provided an MSE of 0.01 on the training data and 0.013 on the testing data. Ding et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> developed an LSTM-based method for detecting and mitigating faults, such as spikes and off-sets in cyber-physical systems. Moreover, the authors proposed an online fault mitigation approach. The mitigation is performed by replacing the detected faults with the forecasted values. The authors point out that DL-based techniques have exceeded conventional techniques in terms of performance as the size of data and complexity rise.</p><p>In the context of fault management, some studies consider fault management as a whole. They usually try to deal with fault management by the implementation of SON. For example, Mismar and Evans in <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref> introduced a deep Q-learning algorithm for SON automate fault management. They used exploration and exploitation concepts in order to improve the downlink the interference and noise ratio (SINR). Their simulation reveals that the proposed algorithm is able to promote the performance of the cellular network in terms of downlink SINR and downlink throughput. In comparison with the classical ML techniques, supervised algorithms, the proposed deep RL-based approach in that paper offers two significant advantages, (1) it is not dependent on human supervision, and (2) it does not need data for training.
