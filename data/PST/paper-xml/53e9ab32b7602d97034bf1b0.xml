<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) are infrastructure-less networks, dynamically formed by an independent system of mobile nodes that are connected via wireless links. Because routing is performed by nodes with limited resources, load should be efficiently distributed through the network. Otherwise, heavily-loaded nodes may make up a bottleneck that lowers the network performances by congestion and larger delays. Regrettably, load-balancing is a critical deficiency in MANET shortest-path routing protocols, as nodes at the center of the network are much heavily-loaded than the others. Thus, we propose, in this paper, load-balancing mechanisms that push the traffic further from the center of the network. Basically, we provide novel routing metrics that take into account nodes degree of centrality, for both proactive and reactive routing protocols.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) are infrastructureless networks, dynamically formed by an autonomous system of mobile nodes that are connected via wireless links <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Because mobile nodes communicate with each other via bandwidth-constrained, variable capacity, error-prone, and insecure wireless channels, wireless links have significantly lower capacity than wired links and, hence, congestion is more challenging. Besides, batteries carried by each mobile node have limited power, thus limiting the processing power, which in turn limits services and applications that can be supported by each node <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Such constraints require the traffic to be evenly distributed among the mobile hosts. Otherwise, heavily-loaded nodes may cause congestion and large delays or even deplete energy quickly.</p><p>Regrettably, most current MANET routing protocols lack load-balancing. A survey on load distribution in MANET shows that shortest-path MANET routing protocols tend to use centrally located nodes in a large number of routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Since few nodes have to carry excessive loads, congestion increases, leading to undesirable effects as longer delays, lower packet delivery and higher routing overhead. Subsequently, we present in this paper novel load-balancing mechanisms that push the traffic further from the center of the network in order to alleviate the load at central nodes. A major challenge this work faces is to provide an appropriate localization-free 1 definition of the center of the network, using the topology information available at every node. Since the topology information may be exhaustive (proactive protocols) or partial (reactive protocols), we had to consider each case separately.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief overview of the related work is presented. Section 3 details the proposed load-balancing mechanism, which performances are evaluated in Section 4. Eventually, Section 5 presents conclusions and future work. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>We view the proposed load-balancing approaches in literature as two major categories: multi-path approaches versus single-path approaches. In multi-path approaches, many paths are established between a source-destination pair of nodes, and traffic between these nodes is split on the different paths. Load-balancing consists in this case in determining the amount of traffic on each path minimizing a certain cost function.</p><p>For instance, Yin and Lin propose a multi-path load-balancing mechanism, MALB, which iteratively adjusts the traffic rate on each path so as to minimize the average end-to-end delay of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A similar mechanism is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for multi-path source-routing protocols. <ref type="bibr">Wu and</ref> Harms define a correlation between two node-disjoint paths as the number of links between nodes on the separate paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Results show that as the correlation increases, the end-to-end delay along both paths increases. Therefore, a routing protocol that balances traffic across the least-correlated paths is introduced, in order to decrease the delay.</p><p>In single-path approaches, however, only a path is established between a source-destination pair of nodes. Various single-path load-balancing mechanisms have been proposed, like different routing metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, packet caching <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, directional antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, etc. For instance, Zhu and Hassanein present in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> a novel routing protocol, LBAR, which routing metric takes into account the degree of nodal activity, being the number of active paths through the node. Lee and Riley also propose that overloaded nodes would be given the freedom to forbid additional communications to set up through them unless their overloaded status is dissolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therefore, each node maintains a threshold value as a criterion for decision of whether or not to respond to RREQ messages. Some other papers provided a performance comparison between single-path and multi-path load-balancing approaches. In essence, though multi-path approaches offers numerous advantages as increasing reliability and fault tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, it appears that single-path approaches are much more efficient when it comes to load-balancing. Pearlman et al. demonstrate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that multi-path routing is effective when the alternate paths are disjoint, which is not easy to achieve in mobile ad hoc networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Besides, Ganjali and Keshavarzian show that in any ad hoc network with a huge number of nodes multi-path routing can balance the load significantly better than single-path routing only if a very large number of paths is used between any source-destination pair of nodes, typically a 100 paths per node pair in a 500-node network <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The analytical model</head><p>Our proposal is motivated by the result of Pham and Perreau's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, that we briefly present in this section. The reader may refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for further details.</p><p>Pham and Perreau introduced a simple routing model so as to determine the load distribution in an ad hoc network which uses single-path routing. They considered a network of N nodes uniformly distributed over a disk D of radius R with the density d. N is related to the surface density d by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N ¼ pR 2 d:<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>Let A be a node within the distance r from the center of the disk D and X(a) a point of the disk border so that the angle [AO, AX(a)] would be of aperture da. Let S a (da) be a portion of the disk D. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> portrays the network model.</p><p>The aim is to determine the number of traffic routes going through A and whose sources are nodes from S a (da).</p><p>In order to answer this question, we need to determine the number of possible destinations B of traffic generated by a source from S a (da) and forwarded by A.</p><p>Since the studied routing protocols use shortest-path algorithms, Pham and Perreau approach optimal routes to straight lines. Therefore, the number of optimal routes through A would be the number of straight lines joining a point of S a (da) to a node of S a+p (da). This number was approached to the value <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N A ¼ pðR 2 À r 2 Þ 2 d 2 bda 4 ;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where b is a positive small real used to adapt the theoretical model to reality, since real routes are not perfectly straight.</p><p>Given that links are bidirectional, the total number of optimal routes passing through A and generated by any node from the whole disk D is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">N T ¼ 2 Â Z p 0 pðR 2 À r 2 Þ 2 d 2 b 4 da;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">N T ¼ pðR 2 À r 2 Þ 2 d 2 b 2 ;<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>and the forwarded traffic by node A would be</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">k A ¼ N T Á k ¼ pðR 2 À r 2 Þ 2 d 2 b 2 k;<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where k represents the average load in a route. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Model validation</head><p>In order to validate the analytical model presented above, we implemented it on Matlab <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. We randomly generated a 100-node graph with a uniform density of probability in a 100 Â 100 unit surface, each node having a transmission range of 20 units. Then, using Dijkstra's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, we computed shortest-paths between each possible pair of nodes in the network. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> illustrates the resulting graph.</p><p>From this figure, it appears that central nodes are much implicated in shortest-paths then peripheral nodes, which is in accordance with Pham and Perreau's conclusions. We also computed, for each node in the network, the number of shortest-paths in which it participates. The result is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, in comparison with the analytical formula of Pham and Perreau (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>)).</p><p>From these results, we are likely to believe that Pham and Perreau's conclusions are legitimate. Thus, we propose in the following section our mechanisms to achieve load-balancing in shortest-path routing protocols, based on their results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Proposed mechanisms to achieve load-balancing</head><p>From Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>), it appears that load is maximal at the center of the network, decreases as we go further from the center and is minimal at the network edges. Hence, it suffices, for the network load to be balanced, that traffic flees the center of the network.</p><p>Our main idea is the following. Since shortest-path routing is to blame for load unbalance, it is a requisite to provide a new routing metric (instead of a simple hop count) that takes into account the degree of nodes centrality when deciding on a route. In other terms, instead of choosing shortest routes, we suggest to choose routes that are relatively short but are formed by nodes that are the farthest possible from the center of the network.</p><p>We put forward a definition of the centrality e(k) of a node k, that we will specify afterward. We propose the following routing metric as a basis of decision on the best route to a destination:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minimize</head><p>1 n</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">X n k¼1 eðkÞ;<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where n represents the number of nodes in a route. In other terms, such a metric favors the routes where nodes are the farthest to the center of the network.</p><p>It is important to notice here that such a minimization does not require any constraints since both of the terms involved, 1  n and P n k¼1 eðkÞ, constrain each other in a push-pull fashion. For instance, minimizing the number of hops in a route would maximize the sum of nodes centralities (since shortest routes pass through central nodes), and vice versa. Besides, the number of hops is always equal to or above 1, since a node is at least 1-hop away from another (which takes away the need to a non-negativity constraint).</p><p>We so far presented the routing metric that will be used to achieve the load-balancing. In the following, we will try to define the measure e(k) that reflects the centrality of a node k.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Case of reactive routing protocols: focus on AODV</head><p>AODV <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is a reactive routing protocol for MANET, proposed an experimental RFC by IETF. In reactive routing approaches, a node may not have a route to a destination when needed, in which case a route discovery procedure is initiated. The route discovery typically consists of the network-wide flooding of a route request message (RREQ) and a unicast reply (RREP) containing the discovered paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Specifying a node's degree of centrality</head><p>An interesting fact about the route discovery process is the fact that forwarding nodes update their routing tables when they receive a RREQ message <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Taking into account the fact that most shortest-path routes pass through the center of the network, we expect the nodes to have as larger routing tables as they approach the center of the network. Such an intuition can be proved by examining another result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. According to this study, the number of routes passing through a node A at distance r from the center of the disk using a shortest-path routing algorithm is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">N ¼ pðR 2 À r 2 Þd 2 b 2 :<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>Given that, for a route to be established through node A, A needs to have a corresponding entry in its routing table, we infer that the size of the routing table of node A is also as smaller as r increases (i.e. as the node A gets further from the center). Thus, we opt for the size of a node's routing table as a characterization of its centrality and we suggest the following metric:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Minimize 1 n X n k¼1 sizeðrtableðkÞÞ;<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>where size(rtable(k)) represents the number of entries in the routing table of a node k among the n nodes participating in the studied route.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Modifying the routing algorithm so as to support the new routing metric</head><p>Basically, the way RREQ and RREP messages are forwarded has been changed. We remind the reader that in reactive routing protocols, routing tables update occurs when such messages are received. More specifically, when a node (X) receives a RREQ message (expressing the desire of the source node (S) to establish route to destination through node (X)), it updates its routing table using the predecessors list that figures in this packet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, before evaluating the possibility of favorably considering the source's request. Should this list of predecessors happen to be shorter than the route node (X) has in its routing table to the source, node (X) deletes the old route from its table and replaces it by this sequence of predecessors.</p><p>In our proposal, instead of comparing the route to (S) announced by node (S)'s RREQ message with the route to (S) that already exists in node (X)'s routing table on a hop-count basis, (X) compares these two routes using the proposed metric (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>)).</p><p>However, in practice Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>) cannot be implemented as is, because it requires that every node knows the average size of the routing tables of all nodes involved in the path, which leads to frequent signaling updates between nodes. In the following, we provide an enhanced average eccentricity computation formula that takes into account the signaling constraints. Using this formula, it suffices for a nth node (V n ) in a path to know the number n of previous nodes and the arithmetic average of their eccentricities (e k ) 16k6nÀ1 , to obtain the new average P(n + 1) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Pðn þ 1Þ ¼ 1 n þ 1 X nþ1 k¼1 e k ;<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">Pðn þ 1Þ ¼ 1 n þ 1 X n k¼1 e k þ 1 n þ 1 e nþ1 ;<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">Pðn þ 1Þ ¼ n n þ 1 Á 1 n X n k¼1 e k þ 1 n þ 1 e nþ1 ;<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">Pðn þ 1Þ ¼ n n þ 1 Á PðnÞ þ 1 n þ 1 e nþ1 :<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>Below, we provide a concrete example:</p><p>1. (n + 1)th node receives: (a) average eccentricity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P(n) = 7.5; (b)</formula><p>number of previous nodes in considered path:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">n = 3.</formula><p>2. Then if, e.g. eccentricity of (n + 1)th node is e(n + 1) = 6.1, then new average is Computation of best routes according to the proposed routing metric is subsequently provided in Algorithm 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Pðn þ 1Þ ¼ 3 3 þ 1 Â 7:5 þ 1 3 þ 1 6:1 ¼ 7:15:</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1.</head><p>Proposed algorithm to compute less-loaded routes in AODV 1. Source node S sends a RREQ message including the size of its routing table as its eccentricity:</p><p>Pð1Þ ¼ e 1 ¼ sizeðrtableðSÞÞ:</p><p>2. Upon receipt of this message, neighbor node V 1 , not knowing a route to the solicited destination, acquires P(n) = P(1) and n = 1 from the received RREQ message and diffuses a modified replica with the novel average eccentricity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Pð2Þ ¼ 1 2 Pð1Þ þ 1 2</formula><p>sizeðrtableðV 1 ÞÞ: </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Pðn þ 1Þ ¼ n n þ 1 PðnÞ þ 1 n þ 1</formula><p>sizeðrtableðV n ÞÞ:</p><p>4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Case of proactive routing protocols: focus on OLSR</head><p>In the following, we present our load-balancing mechanism for proactive routing protocols, typically OLSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. In order to reduce the important signaling load that keeps routing protocols in infrastructure-based networks from being deployable in ad hoc networks, OLSR suggests that only a few nodes, designated as MPRs (multi-point relays), are allowed to retransmit received HELLO messages. However, to maintain network connectivity despite signaling reduction, OLSR proposes that a node X selects its MPRs among its 1-hop neighbors such that they let it reach all its 2-hop neighbors. The node X is said to be an MPR Selector of these MPRs. We can write the relation between MPRs and MPR Selectors as follows: For all nodes X; Y; ðX is an MPR of YÞ () ðY is an MPR Selector of XÞ: ð13Þ</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref> and<ref type="figure">b</ref>. illustrate the benefits of MPR-based broadcast in terms of signaling overhead reduction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Specifying a node's degree of centrality</head><p>In the case of reactive protocols (like previously presented AODV), a node knows routes only to a limited set of nodes, and has to ask for routes to any other nodes every time it needs to reach them.</p><p>However, for proactive routing protocols like OLSR, a node knows how to reach any other node in the network, at anytime. Of course, if all routes to all nodes are fully specified in a node's routing table, we can imagine how large this routing table would be. Therefore, only the next hop to reach a destination is specified.</p><p>In the case of OLSR, a node maintains, in addition to a routing table, a Topology Information Base <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> containing the address of the last node before reaching a destination. Such last hop, referred to as ''t_last_addr" is typically an MPR of the destination, referred to as ''t_dest_addr".</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> portrays an example of such a set. In this example, the first topology tuple in this set means that node (3) is the last node before reaching node <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> for which it represents an MPR.</p><p>Given that central nodes participate in more routes than the average (according to Pham and Perreau's results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), it seems reasonable to infer that central nodes have more MPR Selectors than any other node in the network (as each node is reachable through its MPRs, as we explained in the previous example). Therefore, one can safely assume that the more a node has MPR Selectors, the closer it is likely to be to the center of the network. In Section 5, this assumption will be validated by simulation. Following these observations, we propose the number of MPR Selectors of a node X (i.e. the number of nodes that elected X as one of their MPRs) as an eccentricity measure of this node. We suggest, in consequence, the following routing metric to determine potentially less-loaded routes: </p><p>where size(MPR_Selector_List(k)) represents the number of entries in the MPR Selector List of a node k among the n nodes participating in the studied route.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Acquiring the MPR Selector List's size for a given node</head><p>In the previous paragraph, we proposed to measure the average eccentricity of a route by the average number of MPR Selectors of its nodes. A question arises on how to measure such average. This is possible by evaluating each tuple of the Topology Information Base. For instance, we can deduce from the previous example (5.) that: Node (3) is an MPR of nodes (1) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is an MPR of nodes (4), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) ) Node (1) has 3 MPR Selectors By performing this computation over the whole Topology Information Base, we can deduce for each node the number of its MPR Selectors, and therefore, from the point of view of the set's owner, we can tell which nodes are more likely to be close to the center of the network (and therefore more likely to be heavily-loaded).</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">) Node (3) has 2 MPR Selectors Node (2) is an MPR of node (3) ) Node (2) has 1 MPR Selector Node (</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Modifying the routing algorithm so as to support the new routing metric</head><p>Now assuming that the previous step was performed, each node can measure the eccentricity of any other node in the network (defined as the number of MPR Selectors) and compare it to that of other nodes. In proactive proto-cols, packet routing is simply performed by checking in the routing table the entry that corresponds to the desired destination. Therefore, to change the routing algorithm, it is necessary to change how the routing table is computed.</p><p>Routing tables in MANET proactive routing protocols are very similar to those of shortest-path routing protocols of infrastructure-based networks. Typical shortestpath algorithm, provided by RFC 3626 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> to compute the routing table of a given node X, is presented in Algorithm 2.</p><p>As we aim at avoiding nodes with large MPR Selector Lists in the routes, we simply have to choose, for each destination, a next hop whose MPR Selector List is the shortest possible. That is to say, if a node A has two possible next hops to reach a destination B, having respectively 5 and 7 MPR Selectors each, than node A is recommended to select the next hop with 5 MPR selectors, as it is likely to be farther from the center of the network than the next hop with 7 MPR selectors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Simulation results</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the proposed load-balancing mechanisms, we implemented them on AODV <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and OLSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> as respective representatives of reactive and proactive routing approaches. Simulations were run on ns-2.29 <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> for AODV and ns-2.28 for OLSR. We defined 10 different scenarios for the simulations, each having different mobility patterns. The mobility model used was random-waypoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, and the node speed was uniformly distributed between 0 and 20 m/s with an average of 10 m/s. As for the simulated network, we considered 50 nodes, 40 of which were traffic sources. Traffic was created with constant-bit-rate (CBR) date sources and packet size was 512 bytes. Eventually, mobile nodes were placed within a rectangle of 670 m Â 670 m and simulations were run for 900 s with pause time varying from 0 to 700 s, depending on mobility pattern.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Case of reactive routing protocols</head><p>In the case of AODV, we associated a node's degree of centrality with the size of its routing table. In order to prove such claim, we simulated the previously presented scenario and deduced the average size of nodes' routing tables as function of their distance to the center. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> illustrates the simulation result.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>, it appears that the average number of entries in a node's routing table decreases as the node gets further from the network center, which is in accordance with our intuitive analysis. Pham and Perreau's results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> showed that a node close to the network center partic-ipates in more routes than non central nodes. On the other hand, the more routes a node is involved in, the more it receives RREQ messages. As routing tables are update at the reception of RREQ messages, then central nodes are expected to have larger routing tables than the others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">Case of proactive routing protocols</head><p>In case of OLSR, we associated a node's degree of centrality with the size of its MPR Selector List. In order to prove such a claim, we simulated the previously presented described scenario using OLSR as a routing protocol and we evaluated the average size of a node's MPR Selector list as function of its distance to the network center. Simulation results are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>.</p><p>Again, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> is evidence for the legitimacy of our characterization of a node's degree of centrality in a MANET network deploying OLSR as routing protocol, as the average size of a node's MPR Selector List (i.e. the number of its MPR Selectors) decreases as the node gets further from the network center. Indeed, central nodes participate in a large number of routes according to Pham and Perreau's results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Since nodes are accessible through their MPRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, it seems reasonable to infer that center nodes are the MPRs of many nodes, that is to say that central nodes have large MPR Selector lists.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Performance evaluation of the proposed load-balancing mechanisms</head><p>The following parameters are investigated:</p><p>The load distribution, which provides the average relayed traffic in Kbps as function of the distance to the network center, in accordance with the studied analytical model. The end-to-end delay, which represents the average time taken to transfer a data packet from a CBR source to its destination. The packet delivery fraction, which represents the ratio of the number of received data packets at the destinations to the number of data packets generated by the CBR sources. The routing overhead, defined as the ratio of the size of routing messages generated by a routing protocol to the size of received data packets at the destinations. This metric is a measure of how many bytes of signaling are needed to receive one byte of data. It captures the efficiency of the routing protocol.</p><p>Reported performances in simulations are compared to those of non load-balanced scenarios and, whenever the comparison is relevant, also to those of the load-balancing mechanism proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Performance evaluation in terms of load distribution</head><p>Figs. 8-11 portray load distribution as function of the distance from the center of the network for both AODV and OLSR. For each case, performances were evaluated both in a low mobility scenario and in a high mobility scenario. As a reference, performances without load-balancing are plotted in the same graph.</p><p>Without any load-balancing, we observe an unbalanced load distribution through the network. However, using the novel load-balancing schemes, load is greatly reduced at the central nodes (up to 44% for nodes within 30 m from the center, in the case of AODV) while non central nodes' load is augmented (about 400% within 200 m from the center in the case of AODV). This result can be explained by the fact that packets are not necessarily transmitted through shortest-paths anymore. Since the new best routes may be longer than shortest-paths, non central nodes are  being more involved in the data transmission process than they used be without load-balancing. Still, we notice that nodes on the edge of the surface had almost null load despite the use of the load-balancing mechanism. In point of fact, these nodes are too far to be frequently solicited and therefore do not have many entries in their routing tables. Finally, we notice that our proposed load-balancing scheme achieves load-balancing even in challenging (high mobility) scenarios. Indeed, by going through less-loaded routes, packets encounter less latency, which makes their transmission less vulnerable to mobility (it is less likely that a mobility event occurs in a 2-s period of observation than in a 7-s period of observation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2.">Performance evolution in terms of end-to-end delay</head><p>Figs. 12 and 13 illustrate the performances of the proposed mechanisms in comparison with no load-balancing scenarios in terms of end-to-end delay. For AODV, performances are also compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The load-balancing mechanism of OLSR was not compared to a reference mechanism since, to the best of our knowledge, no loadbalancing mechanisms were proposed to OLSR in literature.</p><p>From these figures, we notice that end-to-end latency is reduced for both AODV and OLSR. Indeed, in both cases, the aim was to avoid routes that pass through the network center and therefore are likely to be overloaded. By selecting less-loaded routes, packets pass through nodes where buffers are less full than those of the shortest-path. Hence, these packets incur less latency, even though they travel through longer routes (than the shortest-path).</p><p>We also notice that our proposal outperforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> in terms of end-to-end delay. This can be explained by the fact that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> shortest-path is still applied in routing, and therefore load-balancing performed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> is sub-optimal, as packets still prefer routes that pass through the center of the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3.">Performance evaluation in terms of packet delivery fraction</head><p>Figs. 14 and 15 illustrate the packet delivery fraction as function of the average pause time. AODV is famed for its good reliability in comparison to other MANET protocols, as long as the traffic rate is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. While all scenarios provide good reliability at lower traffic rates, we notice that our proposal outperforms both AODV and AODV-WAL  [8] as traffic rates increase, because congestion becomes more problematic. In particular, at traffic rates neighboring 1 Mbps, our proposal manages to provide around 80% packet delivery fraction, while AODV and AODV-WAL provide reliability around 60%. Again this enhancement is due to the selection of less-loaded routes. Packets transmitted through such routes get through less-loaded nodes. There-fore, there is a lower probability that they might be dropped due to buffer saturation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4.">Performance evaluation in terms of routing overhead</head><p>Our proposal for OLSR does not induce any additional fields in the transmitted packets, because the proposed routing metric can be computed by just using the informa-   tion a node has on the network (i.e. the Topology Information Base), and only modifications to the routing table computing algorithm were introduced. Therefore, we can safely assume that no signaling overhead is induced by the loadbalancing scheme proposed for OLSR.</p><p>However, as for AODV, the proposed load-balancing scheme requires that RREQ messages include information about the average size of the routing tables of previously crossed nodes.</p><p>Therefore, we need to consider the impact of such modifications in terms of routing overhead. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">16</ref> illustrates the routing overhead as function of the offered load for scenarios without load-balancing, using the load-balancing scheme proposed 2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the load-balancing scheme proposed in this paper.</p><p>From this figure, we can notice that the routing overhead induced by our proposal to AODV is slightly higher than AODV's overhead. This increase in routing overhead is not mainly due to the increase of the routing header by our proposal. In fact, the signaling data added to the IP header is just a field that measures the distance of a node to the network center (according to our metric, and on a hop count basis). Just like the TTL field in IP header, this value is of maximum 255 and therefore only 1 byte (2 8 = 256) of signaling data is added to the IP header. This represents 5% of the size of an IP header <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> and 1.92% that of an average RREQ message (the average size of an RREQ message reported in our simulations was 52 bytes). However, this increase in signaling overhead is mainly due to the fact that we allow nodes to retransmit late RREQ messages, should they announce a longer yet less-loaded route.</p><p>Though our proposal is slightly costly in terms of routing overhead, we believe this increase in signaling overhead is tolerable if we consider the enhanced performances provided by this scheme in terms of reduced delay and increased packet delivery fraction (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">14</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">15</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented novel load-balancing mechanisms for MANET shortest-path routing protocols. Given that maximum load distribution is observed at the center   2 The routing overhead in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> was evaluated in terms of number of packets. In order to compare with our proposal, we converted these values into kilobits (by multiplying by the average size of an RREQ message, 52 Bytes). This is because our proposal not only affects the number of RREQs in the network, but also their size (since we added a new field).</p><p>of the network, we proposed load-balancing schemes that push the traffic further from the center of the network. To define central node, we used two characterizations, depending on whether the routing protocol is proactive or reactive. For nodes using reactive approaches, we characterized their centrality by the size of their routing tables. As for proactive approaches, a node's centrality was defined by size of its MPR Selector List. Subsequently, routing metrics minimizing the average route centrality were accordingly proposed and implemented on two representatives of reactive and proactive approaches, respectively AODV and OLSR. Simulation results demonstrated that our load-balancing mechanisms significantly improved these routing protocols in terms of load distribution, endto-end delay and packet delivery fraction. Besides, unlike the adaptive load-balancing mechanisms, the new scheme provides a proactive measure that prevents congestion and overload by identifying the nodes that are most likely to undergo them.</p><p>For future work, we intend to study the load-balancing problem in scenarios that go beyond Pham and Perreau's hypothesis, for example in case of a non uniform node distribution.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>1570-8705/$ -see front matter Ó 2008 Elsevier B.V.
