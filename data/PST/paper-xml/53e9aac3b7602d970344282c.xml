<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a method for nonrigid motion analysis in time sequences of volume images (4D data). In this method, nonrigid motion of the deforming object contour is dynamically approximated by a physically-based deformable surface. In order to reduce the number of parameters describing the deformation, we make use of a modal analysis which provides a spatial smoothing of the surface. The deformation spectrum, which outlines the main excited modes, can be efficiently used for deformation comparison. Fourier analysis on time signals of the main deformation spectrum components provides a ternporal smoothing of the data. Thus a complex nonrigid deformation is described by only a few parameters: the main excited modes and the main Fourier harmonics. Therefore, 4D data can be analyzed in a very concise manner. The power and robustness of the approach is illustrated by various results on medical data. We believe that our method has important applications in automatic diagnosis of heart diseases and in motion compression.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION 1.Motivation and Organization</head><p>N this article, we propose a unified approach for non-I rigid motion estimation from time sequences of threedimensional images <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, i.e., 4D data, by taking into account both spatial and temporal frequencies of a deformable geometric model. Our method has important applications in automatic diagnosis of heart diseases and in 4D data compression, as we shall see in the experimental section. Our method involves three steps:</p><p>I) Recover the deformation field between each pair of 2) Express the modal coefficients (or amplitudes) of the 3) Express Fourier coefficients of the time-varying mo-</p><p>The information contained in the data can then be compressed, by discarding spatial modes and/or temporal Fourier harmonics. The basic justification of the approach relies on the following observations: most smoothly deforming structures mainly have low-frequency excited modes; this justifies Step 2. Furthermore, for periodic motions like heart motion, modal amplitudes as a function of time are periodic and sine-like; this justifies Step 3. successive 3D images, deformation at each time t, dal amplitudes.</p><note type="other">1</note><p>For Steps 1 and 2, it is possible to constrain the modes beforehand, by letting a deformable model evolve along loworder modes. The advantage is, of course, a reduced numerical complexity and a low-order smoothing of the deformation allowing its robust recovery. Note that Step 1 can be performed not only by our deformable model, but also by optical flow or any other technique providing the motion field <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>.</p><p>The following example can serve as a motivation to our work. Let us consider (Fig. <ref type="figure">I</ref>) the canine 4D heart data provided by the dynamic spatial reconstructor (DSR, a high speed X-ray CT scanner). We used this data as an input to our method. It consists of 18 volume (or 3D) images during a single cardiac cycle. Each volume image has a spatial resolution of 98 x 100 x 110. Dye was injected into the left ventricle, which shows up as a light gray color. Note the difficulty of interpretation of such complex and huge data by physicians. The challenge was to analyze such a tremendous amount of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr">404</ref>,000 bytes, with each voxel being coded on one byte) and supply physicians with a few quantitative parameters describing the motion. We shall see in the experimental section of this paper how we tried to meet these objectives.</p><p>The article is organized as follows:</p><p>In Section 2, we introduce our deformable model for nonrigid motion estimation, develop its governing equations and outline its properties.</p><p>In Section3, we present the modal analysis of the model, allowing a closed-form recovery of the motion by a few parameters: the modal amplitudes. We show how these amplitudes may be used to characterize deformations. Section 3.2, which describes the analytic modes, may be required only for in depth reading.</p><p>(step 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Related Work</head><p>A lot of research work is related to our work. First of all, we want to mention the pioneering work of Terzopoulos et al. on snakes and deformable physics-based models [241, 1261, <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. This work was mainly dedicated to tracking and animation problems rather than analysis.</p><p>A second category of research work is related to the analysis of deformations. Our work was initially inspired by the pioneering work of Pentland et al. on the use of modal deformations to describe deformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, [371. The main differences with our approach is that our modes have a simpler physical meaning (they can be interpreted as the harmonics of the free vibrations basis of the deformable object) while Pentland's modes are more dedicated to animation <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>. Also, we have derived a method to compute our modes beforehand, as a function of the topology of the deformable object only, allowing a much faster computation (Pentland's modes require the knowledge of the exact shape of the original object and, therefore, have to be computed online).</p><p>Our work can be seen as providing a coherent unifying framework between these first two categories of publications, allowing to both track and analyze a deformable 3D motion.</p><p>In addition to these references, we have to mention the work of <ref type="bibr">Cootes et al. [15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[161, [17]</ref>, done independently of, and concurrently with, ours which provides an interesting alternative to the solution of both the tracking and the analysis of the deformation. We also have to mention the work of <ref type="bibr">Bardinet [7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Metaxas [27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, among others, who use deformable parametric models like superquadrics to track and analyze deformable objects. Their work is limited to the class of objects which can be easily represented by such parametric models, which include the left cardiac ventricle. A number of methods to track 3D data were proposed in the past few years. Duncan et al. 121, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, 1401, and <ref type="bibr">Benayoun et al. 191,</ref><ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, used differential constraints; Goldgof [23] and Chen 1131 used a coarse-to-fine approach; <ref type="bibr">Bookstein [12]</ref> and Szeliski and Lavallee <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> proposed energy based methods; Creswell <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Amini <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> suggested data-dedicated methods. All these approaches can be seen as complementary to ours, in the sense that the tracking result they provide could be completed by our proposed analysis. It would however be interesting to compare all these approaches on a specific and common database. This could be the topic of a future work. In Section 4, we propose a Fourier analysis for the timevarying main modal amplitudes; this is particularly well suited for cyclic motions (e.g., heart motion). An example involving 4D medical data is presented.</p><p>We conclude and propose future work in Section 5.</p></div>

We consider both the surface and volume properties of the objects at hand. We restrict ourselves to elastic deformations, i.e., we assume that the object recovers its reference configuration as soon as all applied forces causing deformation are removed. In general, we seek a trade off between precise modeling and computational efficiency. Therefore, simplifying assumptions will be introduced in the modeling.</p></div>

One possible approach is the resolution of these complex equations by an iterative procedure [43]. In this paper, we propose to set 1, = 0. This assumption does not restrict the arbitrary initial configuration of the structure because of the equilibrium force feq. Indeed, this force keeps the structure inflated so that it does not shrink to a point. Thus, the natural state of the system is its initial configuration.</p><p>The advantage of this assumption is that our model can be considered within the framework of linear elasticity. As a consequence, we end up with a set of linear differential equations with node displacements decoupled in each coordinate, regardless of the magnitude of the displacements. Moreover, these linear equations are a prerequisite to further quantitative analysis of the motion (see Section 3).</p><p>On the other hand, our approximation is valid only if the spring orientations undergo small angular variations (typically less than 15 degrees), so that our assumption of constant equilibrium force f,,, holds.3</p><p>Finally, in 3D, the deformation of the system is governed by the 3N-dimensional differential matrix equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">MU + CU + KU = F(t) (6)</formula><p>where U is a vector storing nodal displacements M, C, and K are, respectively, the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices of the system, and F is the image force which has the object attracted by image edges.

The tracking of the mitral valve is indeed a problem of major interest in medical imaging since heart-attacks can generally be predicted from abnormal motion of the valve. Each image has a resolution of 256 x 256 pixels. First, a polar edge extraction is performed on the images [61. Then, for each image, the distance field is computed on every pixel. Thus we can segment the initial valve. We then add volume springs for making our model a template; this will make the tracking more robust.

Therefore a compact description of the motion is provided by spatial smoothing. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> illustrates modal superposition on the real example of the mitral valve.</p><p>4.

The model being Even as a precalculation, solving the generalized eigenproblem is very costly as soon as we consider 3D boundaries (surfaces). For instance, if we consider a mesh of 100 x 100 nodes, a generalized eigenproblem where the size of the matrices is 10,000 x 10,000 has to be solved. It is clear that the analytic expvession of the modes would noticeably reduce the computations [30]. This leads us to consider the theory of solid state physics, where similar problems are encountered at a microscopic level (ionic vibrations of a crystal lattice). If we parameterize our deformable curves by arc length, and similarly our deformable surfaces by natural coordinates, we get periodic boundary conditions which depend on the surface topology. This allows the analogy between our deformable model and a crystal lattice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5">Analytic Modes for Volumes</head><p>Suppose we wish to model a deformable volume. This may be typically the case for nonrigid motion recovery in a whole 3D image <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. Therefore we model a volume mesh of size N x N' x N". The volume has "open" boundary conditions in all three directions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Classification</head><p>In order to test the matching of a specific deformation to a group of predefined deformations, we can consider several admissible deformation? X, of a reference shape like the valve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).

Note that visually, we would classify the four deformations the way the system has done it (that is, reject the first three deformations, and accept the fourth). Note finally that though this set of deformations has been artificially generated, the application of the method to a clinicallysignificant case is straightforward.</p></div>

A dynamic deformation process can be much better described and interpreted if we have a time sequence of images. Therefore, we can draw T consecutive deformation spectra for T + 1 frames of images showing the temporal evolution of the deformation process. For a chosen mode i, we are interested in the time signals: Gl(t) for different values of i.</p><p>5. By deformation we mean the vector of total modal amplitudes, in other 6. If 9 &lt; p then W -1 is the pscudo-inverse of W.</p><p>terms the deformation spectrum.  Let us track the moving ventricle (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) through all image frames. We wish to find a minimum number of parameters describing this sequence. Can we compress the 4D data information for its further analysis, storage, or transmission?</p><p>Let us denote by (Po, . . ., Pr) the positions of this surface during the T + 1 frames of the cardiac cycle. Therefore, 3 N x (T + 1) parameters describe the 4D data (i.e., 345,600 parameters with N = 6,400 and T = 17).</p><p>Let us now track the ventricle in the reduced modal space. We obtain T truncated spectra that store the lowfrequency modal amplitudes through the cycle. 4D data is now stored in 3N + T x p parameters (i.e., 20,985 parameters with p = 105). The numerical value of p is chosen so that each truncated spectrum has 90% of the energy of the corresponding non-truncated spectrum.</p><p>We wish to discard as many modes as possible. Therefore we define a criterion for keeping only the most excited modes among the p low-frequency modes. We compute the energy of an amplitude through the cycle: T L2(i) = I, ;r,(t)*dt <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> The larger L2, the more important the contribution of the corresponding amplitude. In our experiment with this data, the first nine values of L2 were much larger than the other ones. q = 9 was then an obvious threshold for us to choose.</p><p>Let us draw the temporal evolution of the q selected modal amplitudes. They are represented by groups of three in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>. These curves have, globally, a single period sine shape, which is an expectable result for low-frequency modes during a cardiac cycle. Their shape is quite like the ventricle volume curve as a function of time during a cardiac cycle. The shape of these curves encourage us to perform a fast Fourier Transform: Most probably only a few Fourier harmonics will describe the time evolution of the curves.</p><p>, m a -V In order to illustrate this point, let us choose one among these q = 9 spectral components (or modal amplitudes).   As for motion compression, instead of keeping a whole 3D image at every frame (that makes t, t, t, =1,078,000 parameters per frame) we now keep only H x q/(T + l) = 2.5 parameters per frame. This compression of 4D data is impressive: It means that, provided that we keep the first shape, we are able to synthesize the motion with 2.5 parameters per frame. This 4D data is then described by 3N + H x q = 19,245 parameters instead of (T + 1) x t, t t = y 2 3</p><p>19,404,000, which makes a compression of more than 1 0 , for a cardiac cycle whose duration is approximately one second. If the analysis was extended over a much longer period (e.g., 10 minutes), the Compression rate would continuously increase toward the asymptotic value of 1,078,000/2.5, i.e., approximately 4.10 per pame. If we compare the total compression with the transmission of all the 3D images over the 10 minutes, we would get an asymptotic compression factor superior to 10 .</p><p>On the top of the compression ability, the synthetic information that our spatiotemporal processing provides allows comparison of nonrigid motion by comparing very few parameters. The method is indeed useful not only for compression, but also for analysis of dynamic motion for diagnosis purposes.</p><p>The evolution of the left ventricle model over a cardiac cycle is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">15</ref>. In each row, we observe: Left, the evolution of the model in the real space (6); center, the approximation with 9 = 9 modes (spatial smoothing); right, spatiotemporal processing with nine modes and five Fourier harmonics.</p><p>Finally, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">16</ref> displays the mean Euclidean error between the real-space mesh (complete computation) and respectively spatial smoothing (modal recovery) and spatiotemporal smoothing (modal and Fourier recovery). Note that this error (in voxels) is extremely small. The position of the two peaks indicate that the error is maximum in the middle of diastolic and systolic shapes: This is because the change in the overall shape is maximum in those frames. An interesting topic would be the study of the error range, and its relationship with the number of modes and Fourier harmonics. </p></div>

It has important applications in medical analyis of nonrigid motion (mainly for automatic diagnosis purposes), and also provides a tremendous compression of multidimensional nonrigid motion, mainly for storage or transmission purposes.</p><p>Our future work will focus on the clinical use and validation of this framework, and its transfer toward concrete medical applications, in particular in the cardiology field.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. 4D data displaying a 3D dog ventricle in motion.
