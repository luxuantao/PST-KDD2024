<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In many supply chains assembled products are composed of complementary components. It is well-known that a large number of firms in industry outsource the production of the components to external suppliers in order to reduce costs and increase production flexibility. For example, in the US, Toyota outsources the production of car components to many suppliers who then deliver the components to Toyota's assembly plant in Kentucky <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In particular, more than 75% of the parts and 98% of the steel used in the production of vehicles at this assembly plant come from US suppliers. In 2005, the plant had 350 suppliers across the continental United States. The Toyota production system (one of the first successful examples of a Just-In-Time system) is ''all about producing only what's needed and transferring only what's needed." By adopting such an efficient system known as a ''pull"-type supply chain, Toyota's assembly plant uses the components (delivered by its suppliers) to assemble final products when the orders of its customers (e.g., dealers) arrive; see, for example, Chopra and Meindl <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Simchi-Levi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. As reported by Reinhardt in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Nokia also recently implemented the pull strategy to make built-to-order phones each with a unique faceplate with the oper-ator's logo on it and special keypad buttons that take users directly to certain wireless services, etc. Another well-known example is Dell which adopts the pull-type strategy to assemble computers only when its customers' orders arrive online.</p><p>As Cachon <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Granot and Yin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have discussed, in a pulltype assembly supply chain all suppliers of the assembly plant need to determine their production quantities of components while the assembly plant needs to choose its sale price of final product. Moreover, in order to quickly respond to its customers, the plant also aims to strengthen partnering relationship with its suppliers and establish coordination with the suppliers for system-wide improvement. As another real example of a manufacturer's effort to induce supply chain coordination, in 2006, Motorola decided to spend $60 million in Singapore to centralize and streamline global supply chain operations with its suppliers and customers. As outsourcing is considered to be one of the strategies achieving supply chain integration, there is an extensive literature focusing on outsourcing strategies and vertical integration in supply chains; see, Cachon and Harker <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>As the above examples illustrate, the coordination of a decentralized supply chain with assembled products appears to be an interesting and important problem worth investigating. Motivated by these examples, in this paper we consider the following natural question: what mechanism can be developed to coordinate all members in such a supply chain? As Cachon <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> indicated, supply chain coordination is achieved if and only if all firms in a decentralized supply chain can behave (that is, make decisions) as if they are operating in a centralized supply chain. More specifically, in a decentralized supply chain, all firms primarily aim at optimizing 0377-2217/$ -see front matter Ó 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2009. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref>.011 their own individual objectives rather than the chain-wide objective, thus their self-serving focus may result in a deterioration of the chain-wide performance. To improve the supply chain's performance, a proper mechanism must be developed to coordinate all channel members so that both the individual supply chain members' objectives and the chain-wide performance can be optimized; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Leng</ref> and Zhu <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. A common (and useful) mechanism for supply chain coordination is to develop a set of properly-designed contracts among all supply chain members <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. With the successful use of this mechanism the last decade has witnessed a rapidly increasing interest in supply chain coordination with contracts.</p><p>In this paper, we restrict our attention to a multiple-supplier, one-manufacturer supply chain with complementary products. (Hereafter, such a supply chain with complementary products is called an assembly supply chain, as in Carr and Karmarkar <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.) In this assembly supply chain, multiple-suppliers produce their complementary components, and serve a common manufacturer who assembles the final products with short life cycles and satisfies a random demand.Our assumption of short product life cycles reflects the following fact: the last two decades have witnessed rapid technological innovation and a high level of competition in the marketplace. In response to these developments, many firms (e.g., manufacturers of personal computers, cell phones, cars, etc.) have implemented the philosophy of ''life-cycle management" to reduce life cycles of their products. As in many publications (such as Linh and Hong <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and Parlar and Weng <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) concerned with the assembly supply chains with short product life cycles, we construct our model and perform our analysis using the single-period (newsboy) setting. Similar to the pull-type system discussed in Cachon <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Granot and Yin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the n ðP 2Þ suppliers determine their production quantities independently of each other. Moreover, we assume that all members of this supply chain are risk-neutral and the demand is only sensitive to the retail price chosen by the manufacturer. Note that, in practice, consumers' demands may also depend on some other factors (e.g., the quality of the product that the consumers buy). However, in this paper, we only focus on the manufacturer's pricing decision and the suppliers' quantity decisions, as in most of previous publications regarding assembly supply chains. Accordingly, we assume that the demand is only dependent of the manufacturer's retail price, and thus use Petruzzi and Dada's additive and multiplicative demand forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>-which have been commonly used to analyze assembly supply chains with price-dependent demand-to characterize the random demand.</p><p>We use buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts between the n suppliers and the manufacturer to coordinate the supply chain. With the buy-back contract, the manufacturer returns the unused components to the suppliers at the buy-back price. Because all unused components can be returned to the suppliers (albeit at some loss), the manufacturer does not concern himself with the optimal order quantities of the components. Instead, he attempts to choose the optimal price to maximize his expected profit. Buyback contracts have been widely used to analyze supply chain coordination. As described in Cachon <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a typical buy-back contract (also called return policies) has two parameters; the ith supplier's wholesale price, w i , and the buy-back price, v i ; i ¼ 1; . .. ; n.</p><p>Under such a contract, supplier i charges the manufacturer w i per unit purchased at the beginning of the single period, and pays the manufacturer v i per unit remaining at the end of the period. In our paper, we model the buy-back contract as a vector ðw; vÞ, where w ¼ ðw 1 ; . . . ; w n Þ and v ¼ ðv 1 ; . . . ; v n Þ. For an early application of buy-back contracts, see Pasternack <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>With the lost-sales cost-sharing contract, when shortages arise, suppliers and the manufacturer share the shortage cost. Assuming that one unit of the final product needs one unit of each of the n components, the manufacturer needs equal number of components for assembly from each supplier. If the number of components re-ceived from the suppliers happens to be different, the number of the final product the manufacturer can assemble equals the minimum of these quantities. In our lost-sales cost-sharing contract, the shortage penalty cost incurred by the manufacturer at the end of the single period is shared among all members of this supply chain. Given a unit shortage (underage) cost u, we define the percentage of this cost absorbed by the ith supplier as / i 2 ½0; 1 with / ¼ P n i¼1 / i 2 ½0; 1. Thus, all suppliers pay the shortage cost /u, and the manufacturer bears the cost of ð1 À /Þu. The lost-sales costsharing contract is characterized by the vector / ¼ ð/ 1 ; . . . ; / n Þ. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for a complete list of the notation used in this paper.</p><p>Our paper uses game theory to analyze non-cooperative and coordinated assembly supply chains. In practical applications the manufacturer and n suppliers may simultaneously or sequentially make optimal decisions to maximize their individual expected profits. Accordingly, we analyze both a simultaneous-move game (in which all members of the assembly supply chain make their decisions concurrently) and a leader-follower game (in which the manufacturer announces its pricing decision before n suppliers make their production decisions). We use the Nash and Stackelberg equilibria to characterize all supply chain members' optimal decisions for the simultaneous-move and leader-follower games, respectively. Note that Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> also considered the two games but only with the multiplicative demand form, and used different contracts to induce supply chain coordination.</p><p>Since the supply chain members make optimal decisions to maximize their individual profits, the system-wide expected profit is usually lower than the case when they coordinate their decisions. Thus, to improve the supply chain's performance, we design buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts which achieve supply chain coordination. Under properly-designed contracts, all supply chain members choose their equilibrium solutions and the maximum system-wide profit is realized.</p><p>In a recent literature review <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Leng and Parlar surveyed a large number of publications that focus on supply chain-related game problems with substitutable products and indicate that there are only a few papers concerned with game-theoretic models for complementary products. We now briefly review some of the important papers that used game-theoretic models in assembly supply chains. Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> considered joint pricing-production decision problems in supply chains with complementary products for a single period. Wang adopted a multiplicative demand model which is sensitive to sale price, and incorporated the consignment-sales and revenue-sharing contracts into both simultaneous-move and leader-follower games. Since Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> analyzed assembly supply chains with the multiplicative demand form, in this paper we focus our analysis on the additive demand case, and provide only the major results for the multiplicative demand case without specific discussion.</p><p>Wang and Gerchak <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> examined a pricing-capacity decision problem for an assembly supply chain with an assembler and multiple-suppliers. Assuming that the demand is random but it is independent of price, the authors considered two game settings: The first is one where the assembler sets the prices, and the second is for the suppliers to simultaneously select the prices each wants to charge for its component. Bernstein and DeCroix <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> considered an assembly supply chain where two components are used to assemble a single final product that is then sold by an assembler to meet the random, price-independent demand. The authors investigated the equilibrium base-stock levels for the assembler and two component suppliers, and described a payment scheme to coordinate the assembly supply chain. Granot and Yin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> investigated competition and cooperation in a multiple-supplier, onemanufacturer supply chain with complementary products. For the pull and push systems, these authors considered two levels of problems: at the first level, they used the concepts of Nash equi-librium and farsighted stability to identify stable coalitional structures among suppliers; and at the second level they developed a Stackelberg game to examine the interactions between the manufacturer and suppliers.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we assume that the random price-dependent demand is given in additive form, and design a set of buy-back and lostsales cost-sharing contracts to coordinate the assembly supply chain for both simultaneous-move and leader-follower games. In Section 3, we assume that the price-dependent demand is also random but it assumes the multiplicative form. For this case, we show that the supply chain can always be coordinated by a set of properly-designed contracts for both simultaneous-move and leader-follower games. The paper ends with conclusions in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Non-cooperative equilibria and supply chain coordination with price-dependent random demand: Additive form</head><p>In this section, the manufacturer assembles the suppliers' components to satisfy random price-dependent demand in an additive form. We consider the following two games: (i) a ''simultaneousmove" game where the manufacturer and the suppliers concurrently make their decisions without any communication; (ii) a ''leader-follower" game in which the manufacturer, as the leader, first announces his pricing decision and the suppliers, as the followers, respond to the leader's decision. For the former game, we compute the Nash equilibrium; and for the latter, we compute the Stackelberg equilibrium for the supply chain. To coordinate this assembly supply chain, we then find the globally-optimal solution and develop a properly-designed buy-back and lost-sales costsharing contract that can achieve supply chain coordinate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Suppliers' production and manufacturer's pricing decisions with no coordination: Nash vs. Stackelberg equilibria</head><p>We now consider a non-cooperative case where n suppliers (denoted by S i ; i ¼ 1; . . . ; nÞ and the manufacturer determine their respective production quantities q i and the retail price p independently without supply chain coordination.</p><p>Using the pull-type strategy, the manufacturer receives Q ¼ minðq 1 ; q 2 ; . . . ; q n Þ units from each supplier (because the assembly of a final product only needs one unit of each component), and assembles minðQ ; DÞ units of final products (where D denotes the realized demand during the single period). If D is more than Q, then the manufacturer assembles Q units of final products, and incurs a unit underage cost u for each unit of unsatisfied demand. According to the lost-sales cost-sharing contract that is in place, the percentage of this cost absorbed by S i ði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; nÞ is / i 2 ½0; 1, and the manufacturer's percentage is 1 À / ¼ 1 À P n i¼1 / i . However, if Q is more than D, then, according to the buy-back contract,supplier S i buys back the unsold components at the unit price of v i , i ¼ 1; . . . ; n. Since S i produces the component i at the unit production cost c i and sells them to the manufacturer at the unit wholesale price w i , S i receives the net profit of w i À c i &gt; 0 for each unit component sold to the manufacturer. Here, we assume that v i P w i À c i , and thus v i À ðw i À c i Þ is the penalty cost incurred by S i when his production quantity q i exceeds D by one unit. We make this assumption to assure that a buy-back agreement should not benefit a supplier.</p><p>In this section we assume that the demand is random in an additive form and depends on price p. As in Petruzzi and Dada <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the price-sensitive random demand in a commonly-used additive form in the newsvendor context is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Dðp; eÞ ¼ yðpÞ þ e;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where the deterministic term yðpÞ and the error term e are defined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Note that, as indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we assume that the error term has a lower bound A and an upper bound B. This assumption is reasonable because, in reality, the market size cannot be infinite and thus the upper bound B is taken as finite. Moreover, in order to assure that Dðp; eÞ is positive, the lower bound A must be greater than Àa for the additive demand case. The assumption has been widely used in the literature; see, for example, Petruzzi and Dada <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Since A &gt; Àa, it follows that Dðp; eÞ P ðA þ aÞ À bp and thus to ensure that demand always assumes non-negative values (even though yðpÞ could be negative when p P a=b), the manufacturer's retail price p should be smaller than or equal to ða þ AÞ=b, i.e., p 6 ða þ AÞ=b. In fact, when the manufacturer maximizes its profit, the optimal price should always satisfy the inequality because the manufacturer's profit with a non-positive demand cannot be maximum. The demand function (1) is ''common knowledge" for all suppliers and the manufacturer. Thus, all suppliers know the demand range ½yðpÞ þ A; yðpÞ þ B, and determine their quantities subject to this range, i.e., yðpÞ þ A 6 q i 6 yðpÞ þ B, i ¼ 1; . . . ; n.</p></div>

Using the pull-type strategy, the manufacturer incurs the assembly cost m for each unit of satisfied demand, and returns the unused components to suppliers at the end of the single period. The manufacturer's net profit is computed as the revenue from sales, plus the buy-back income, minus the procurement, assembly and the lostsales cost incurred by the manufacturer.Thus, the manufacturer's random profit function, P M , is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P M ¼ p min½Q ; Dðp; eÞ þ v½Q À Dðp; eÞ þ À wQ À m min½Q ; Dðp; eÞ À ð1 À /Þu½Dðp; eÞ À Q þ ¼ ðp À mÞ min½Q; Dðp; eÞ þ v½Q À Dðp; eÞ þ À wQ À ð1 À /Þu½Dðp; eÞ À Q þ ;<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where w ¼ P n i¼1 w i is the manufacturer's purchase cost for all the components that make up one unit of the final product, and v ¼ P n i¼1 v i is the total unit buy-back price paid by n suppliers.

Supply chain coordination with buy-back and lost-sales costsharing contracts</p><p>It is important to note that the Nash and Stackelberg equilibria (found in Theorem 3) may not result in supply chain coordination under which the system-wide profit is maximized. To coordinate this supply chain, we now design buy-back and lost-sales costsharing contracts so that the resulting Nash and Stackelberg equilibria shall be both identical to the globally-optimal solution. In particular, in this section we find the properly-designed values of w (suppliers' wholesale prices), v (suppliers' buy-back prices), and / (lost-sales cost-sharing parameters) which will make the decentralized assembly supply chain behave like a centralized one.</p></div>

In particular, we investigate whether or not this multiple-supplier, one-manufacturer assembly supply chain can be coordinated under a pair of the properly-designed contracts. With the appropriate values of contract parameters ðw; v; /Þ, each member of the supply chain chooses his/her equilibrium solution, which is identical to the globally-optimal solution that maximizes the system-wide expected profit found in Theorem 4. If the proper contracts exist, we attempt to find them.</p><p>Prior to commencing the design of the contract, we present a discussion of the unit underage cost u. As usual, the value of u is estimated as the sum of the opportunity cost of each unsatisfied demand and the goodwill cost per unit unsatisfied demand. The total cost of assembling one unit of the final product is m þ c and p is the unit retail price, thus u ¼ p À ðm þ cÞ þ g, where g is the goodwill cost. Since the goodwill cost is g P 0 (but difficult to measure), we impose the condition that the underage cost should have the property u P p À ðm þ cÞ.</p><p>However, Theorem 4 shows that the globally-optimal price is determined in terms of a given value of u. Since the optimal value of pis not known a priori, the requirement u P p À ðm þ cÞ may not be always satisfied.

Theorem 5 indicates that, for the simultaneous-move game, supply chain coordination can be achieved by the properly-designed buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts. In contrast, if only the buy-back or lost-sales cost-sharing contract is involved, coordination of the supply chain cannot be achieved. For instance, when lost-sales cost-sharing contract is not considered, the value of the term / i ði ¼ 1; . . . ; nÞ becomes zero. Then the conditions given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">19</ref>) are reduced to zv ¼ 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">z ¼ ðw k À c k Þ=v k .</formula><p>From the former condition, we find that v ¼ 0. This makes the second condition unsatisfied due to v k ¼ 0. On the other hand, if we just incorporate the lost-sales cost-sharing contract, then the first condition in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">19</ref>) cannot be satisfied since ð1 À zÞ/u-0. Additionally, we observe from Theorem 5 that there must exist multiple feasible buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts which achieve supply chain coordination. For example, we can set the values of / as</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">/ k ¼ X kÀ1 j¼1 e j þ X n j¼kþ1 e j and / i ¼ 1 c c i þ c k n À 1 À e i ; for i ¼ 1; . . . ; k À 1; k þ 1; . . . ; n;</formula><p>where e i ði-kÞ is sufficiently small number so that all inequalities in (20) are satisfied.</p><p>For the simultaneous-move game, when the random demand is dependent of price in the additive form, we use a buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contract design specified by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_31">21</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_32">22</ref>) to achieve supply chain coordination, under which the equilibrium solution is identical to the globally-optimal solution. From (21), we find that the supplier S k with the smallest unit production cost is also the one with smallest z k ¼ min i¼1;...;n z i . Thus, from Theorem 3, all suppliers use the same production quantity which is determined in terms of z k . In this paper, the supplier S k with the smallest unit production cost is called the ''critical" supplier, and the others are called ''non-critical."</p><p>For the lost-sales cost-sharing contract, the critical supplier S k has the lowest production cost, i.e., the value of this supplier's component has the least value in the final product. This means that the critical supplier should have the least responsibility for sharing the cost of lost sales, thus we set / k ¼ 0.</p><p>For the simultaneous-move game, we list five steps to be used for our contract design that achieves supply chain coordination:</p><p>Step 1: Find the globally-optimal solution ðp Ã ; q Ã Þ from Theorem 4;</p><p>Step 2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">Compute z ¼ ðp Ã À m þ u À cÞ=ðp Ã À m þ uÞ;</formula><p>Step 3: Select the critical supplier S k who has the minimum unit production cost; Step 4: Determine supplier S k 's wholesale price ðw k Þ, buy-back price ðv k Þ and percentage of the underage cost absorbed by this supplier ð/ k Þ as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">w k ¼ ð1 þ zÞc k ; v k ¼ c k ,</formula><p>and / k ¼ 0;</p><p>Step 5: Determine the other suppliers' wholesale price, buy-back price and percentage of the underage cost absorbed by them as follows: for i ¼ 1; . . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">; k À 1; k þ 1; . . . ; n, w i ¼ 1Àz cz u þ 1 À Á c i þ 1Àz cz u À 1 À Á c k nÀ1 ; v i ¼ 1Àz cz uc i þ 1Àz cz u À 1 À Á c k nÀ1 ; / i ¼ 1 c ðc i þ c k nÀ1 Þ: 8 &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; :</formula><p>Under the properly-designed contracts specified in Theorem 5, we can maximize the system-wide profit but cannot assure that each supply chain member individually benefits from the buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts. Next, we examine whether or not each member's individual profit under the proper contracts is higher than that without the buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts. Note that, if the buy-back contract ðw; vÞ is not involved, then supplier S i ði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; nÞ does not need to buy unused components back from the manufacturer and thus the parameter v i ¼ 0, for i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n. If the lost-sales cost-sharing contract is not involved, then each supplier's share of shortage cost is zero, i.e., / i ¼ 0, for i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n. When v i ¼ / i ¼ 0, for i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, we can reduce supplier S i 's random profit in (2) and the manufacturer's random profit in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, respectively, to</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">P S i ¼ w i Q þ s i ðq i À Q Ài Þ þ À c i q i ;<label>ð23Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_39">P M ¼ ðp À mÞ min½Q ; Dðp; eÞ À wQ À u½Dðp; eÞ À Q þ :<label>ð24Þ</label></formula><p>Without the buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts, the manufacturer must find optimal retail price to maximize its expected profit EðP M Þ and supplier S i must make an optimal quantity decision to maximize its expected profit EðP S i Þ. Theorem 6. If the buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts are not involved for the additive demand case, then the Nash equilibrium for the simultaneous-move game can be uniquely determined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">p N ¼ a þ mb þ B À R B A FðxÞdx 2b and q N i ¼ a À mb þ B þ R B A FðxÞdx 2 ;</formula><p>for i ¼ 1; . . . ; n and q N ¼ q N 1 ¼ Á Á Á ¼ q N n . We learn from Remark 1 that, without the buy-back and lostsales cost-sharing contracts, the supply chain cannot be coordinated because, for any value of w i ði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; nÞ, the Nash equilibrium is always not identical to the globally-optimal solution. Theorem 7. If the buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts are not involved for the additive demand case, then, for any value of w i ði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; nÞ, the total profit in terms of the Nash equilibrium given in Theorem6 is always smaller than that in terms of the globallyoptimal solutions given in Theorem 4.</p><p>We learn from Theorem 7 that the supply chain-wide performance is worse off if the buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts are not involved. We denote the supplier S i 's and the manufacturer's expected profits without the contractual mechanism by Eð PS i Þ and Eð PM Þ, respectively. Note that, under the properly-designed contracts given in Theorem 5, S i 's and the manufacturer's expected profits in terms of ðp N ; q N Þ-denoted by EðP N S i Þ and EðP N M Þ-are respectively equal to EðP Ã S i Þ and EðP Ã M Þ, which represent S i 's and the manufacturer's expected profits in terms of the globally-optimal solution ðp Ã ; q Ã Þ. That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">EðP N S i Þ ¼ EðP Ã S i Þ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, and EðP N M Þ ¼ EðP Ã M Þ.</formula><p>According to Theorem 7, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">X n i¼1 Eð PS i Þ þ Eð PM Þ &lt; X n i¼1 EðP Ã S i Þ þ EðP Ã M Þ ¼ X n i¼1 EðP N S i Þ þ EðP N M Þ; which cannot assure that EðP Ã S i Þ &gt; Eð PS i Þ [or, EðP N S i Þ &gt; Eð PS i Þ] and EðP Ã M Þ &gt; Eð PM Þ [or, EðP N M Þ &gt; Eð PM Þ].</formula><p>This means that, even though the system-wide profit can be increased under the properly-designed contracts, n suppliers and the manufacturer may not all individually benefit from the contractual mechanism.

Thus, we need to allow all supply chain members to fairly share the system-wide profit surplus c</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">X n i¼1 EðP Ã S i Þ þ EðP Ã M Þ " # À X n i¼1 Eð PS i Þ þ Eð PM Þ " # :<label>ð25Þ</label></formula><p>We assume that supplier S i receives c S i &gt; 0, for i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, and the manufacturer receives c M &gt; 0, such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">P n i¼1 c S i þ c M ¼ c.

Note that, in the assembly supply chain, all suppliers sell complementary components to the manufacturer who assembles and sells final products. This implies that the system-wide profit would be zero if any member in such a supply chain leaves. Using this fact, we can compute the Shapley value-based allocation of the profit surplus c as shown in the following theorem. Theorem 8. Shapley value suggests that the system-wide profit surplus c should be equally allocated among n suppliers and the manufacturer, i.e., c</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">S 1 ¼ c S 2 ¼ Á Á Á ¼ c Sn ¼ c M ¼ c=ðn þ 1Þ.</formula><p>As a result, n suppliers' and the manufacturer's profits after the allocation are, respectively, computed as Eð</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">PS i Þ þ c=ðn þ 1Þ ði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; nÞ and Eð PM Þ þ c=ðn þ 1Þ.</formula><p>In conclusion, we find that, in order to coordinate the supply chain for the simultaneous-move game with the additive demand form, it is important to consider the following two issues: (i) we should design the buy-back and lost-sale cost-sharing contracts as in Theorem 5 to assure that the Nash equilibrium and the global solution are identical; (ii) we should fairly allocate the systemwide profit surplus c as in Theorem 8 to assure that all supply chain members are better off than without the contractual mechanism.</p><p>2.2.3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">&gt; &lt; &gt; :</head><p>Theorem 14 demonstrates that, for both simultaneous-move and leader-follower games, this assembly supply chain can be coordinated by a pair of proper buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts. Different from the additive case in Section 2, for the multiplicative case we have to consider a specific condition [i.e., j 6 1] and present different properly-designed contracts when the condition is satisfied and not satisfied.</p><p>Next, similar to Section 2, we compute the Nash and Stackelberg equilibria when the buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts are not involved.</p><p>Theorem 15. Without the buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts, the Nash and Stackelberg equilibria are obtained as follows: p N ¼ bm=ðb À 1Þ; q N i ¼ Byðp N Þ; i ¼ 1; . . . ; n; p S ¼ bðml þ wBÞ=½ðb À 1Þl; q S i ¼ Byðp S Þ; i ¼ 1; . . . ; n:</p><p>We find that the total profit in terms of the Nash or Stackelberg equilibrium is always smaller than that in terms of the globally-optimal solutions given in Theorem 12.</p><p>In order to entice all members to cooperate for supply chain coordination, we use (25) to compute the expected profit surplus c, and use Theorem 8 to calculate the allocations to n suppliers and the manufacturer.</p><p>In online Appendix C, we provide two numerical examples to illustrate our analysis for the multiplicative demand case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions and recommendations for further research</head><p>In this paper we considered an assembly supply chain where multiple suppliers produce complementary components that are used by a manufacturer who assembles the final product and sells them directly to a market. The single period demand for the final product is random and depends on the retail price chosen by the manufacturer.</p><p>The suppliers and the manufacturer have an agreement whereby each supplier buys back the unsold components and absorbs a portion of the lost-sales cost. Accordingly, we incorporate the buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts into our inventory-related game model where we assume a price-sensitive random demand in (i) additive, and (ii) multiplicative form. For each case, we develop a pair of properly-designed lost-sales cost-sharing contracts to induce supply chain coordination. To determine the contracts, we first consider the situation where the suppliers and the manufacturer do not cooperate and where the suppliers and the manufacturer determine their production quantities and retail price, respectively. We derive the Nash equilibrium for the simultaneous-move game, and compute the Stackelberg equilibrium for the leader-follower game.</p><p>Next, we examine whether or not the assembly supply chain can be coordinated. We show that, for both simultaneous-move and leader-follower games,the supply chain coordination can always be achieved by a pair of properly-designed buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts. Under the properly-designed contracts, each supplier adopts the equilibrium production quantity and the manufacturer chooses the equilibrium price, and the system-wide profit is maximized as well.</p><p>Since in this paper the demand is assumed to depend on the retail price only, we may relax this assumption in future and analyze assembly supply chains where demand depends on price, quality and some other factors. In another future research direction, we may consider the case where the manufacturer sets the buy-back and shortage parameters to increase its own profits while allowing the suppliers to gain profits so that they are willing to keep the business with the manufacturer. This would be modeled as a two-stage problem in which the manufacturer first sets the contract parameters and all players (i.e., the manufacturer and its suppliers) then find the Nash equilibrium.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>List of notations.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">Symbol</cell><cell>Description</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">c / ¼ i¼1 / m P n</cell><cell>Manufacturer's assembly cost per unit</cell></row><row><cell>p</cell><cell></cell><cell>Retail price of the manufacturer</cell></row><row><cell>P</cell><cell></cell><cell>System-wide profit</cell></row><row><cell>P M</cell><cell></cell><cell>Manufacturer's random profit</cell></row><row><cell>P Si</cell><cell></cell><cell>Supplier i's random profit i ¼ 1; . . . ; n</cell></row><row><cell>q i</cell><cell></cell><cell>Production quantity of supplier i ¼ 1; . . . ; n</cell></row><row><cell>q</cell><cell></cell><cell>Production quantity of all suppliers when they produce the same amount</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Q ¼ min i¼1;...;n ðq i Þ</cell><cell>Number of each component received by manufacturer</cell></row><row><cell>s i</cell><cell></cell><cell>Salvage value for supplier i ¼ 1; . . . ; n for unsold components</cell></row><row><cell>S i</cell><cell></cell><cell>Supplier i ¼ 1; . . . ; n</cell></row><row><cell>u</cell><cell></cell><cell>Underage cost per unit for lost sales</cell></row><row><cell>v v ¼</cell><cell>P n i¼1 v</cell></row></table><note><p>i Unit production cost of supplier i ¼ 1; . . . ; n Dðp; eÞ Price-dependent random demand in the single period.
