<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set (HFLTS) is a powerful tool to depict experts' cognitive complex linguistic information. This paper aims to propose a new score function of HFLTS to eliminate the defects of the subscript-based operations on HFLTSs. Hesitant degree is an intrinsic feature of HFLTS, and the greater the hesitant degree is, the lower the quality of the HFLTS will be. The asymmetric and non-uniform distributed linguistic term set is commonly used when expressing cognitive complex linguistic information. Considering both the hesitant degrees and the unbalanced linguistic terms in evaluations, a new score function of HFLTS, named the Score-HeDLiSF, is proposed based on the psychology of experts. The Score-HeDLiSF shows many advantages over the existing score function of HFLTS in terms of representing both the balanced and unbalanced linguistic information with hesitant degree and linguistic scale functions. Afterward, a hesitant degree-based weighting method is proposed to determine the weights of experts and criteria. To derive robust decision results, the MULTIMOORA method is improved by integrating the ORESTE method, and then we extend it to the unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic context based on the introduced score function of HFLTS. Finally, an investment problem regarding the shared bicycles is solved by the proposed unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA method. The advantages of the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA are highlighted by comparative analyses with two well-known multi-criteria decision-making methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A Multi-Experts Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MEMCDM) problem mainly includes two solution processes: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> evaluating the performance of each alternative under different criteria and establishing the decision matrix; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> aggregating the evaluations of each alternative and ranking the alternatives. When experts evaluate the performance of an alternative (criterion) based on their knowledge and experience for decision-making problems, their cognition usually cannot be quantified, but can be expressed in linguistic terms, such as "fast" spread, "extremely bad" quality and "very beautiful" appearance. How to represent experts' linguistic evaluations exactly and make operations on these evaluation values are fundamental issues for decision-making. Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposed the fuzzy linguistic approach, in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><note type="other">Information Fusion 3 of 31</note><p>which the evaluations are taken as linguistic terms rather than crisp numbers, to make linguistic evaluations standardized, and introduced the model of computing with words to operate the linguistic terms.</p><p>The traditional fuzzy linguistic approach is limited in dealing with complex linguistic evaluations since experts can only use singleton linguistic terms to make judgments. Due to the uncertainty of expert's thinking and the complexity of subjective things, there are rich and complex linguistic evaluations such as "between good and very good", "at least bad"</p><p>and "more than high". To respond to all possible linguistic expressions of experts completely, Rodr√≠guez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> presented the concept of Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set (HFLTS) which shows that the value of a linguistic variable is an ordered and continuous subset in a Linguistic Term Set (LTS). Later, Liao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> introduced the mathematical definition of HFLTSs and called the elements of the HFLTS as the Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Elements (HFLEs). The HFLTS is effective to describe both simple and complex linguistic evaluations. The HFLTS has aroused wide concerns and applications, and the state of the art surveys on HFLTSs can be found in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>Even though the HFLTS makes it possible to represent the complex linguistic expressions, a challenge arises since the HFLTS is generally based on a qualitative scale mapped to a sequence of adjacent integers. Such a symbolic model is debatable and we must justify the choice of equally distributed integers. In fact, unbalanced situation is much common if we consider the psychology of experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Torra <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> initially discussed the unbalanced semantics for an ordered set of linguistic labels in terms of antonyms and negation functions. Afterwards, many achievements have been obtained about the unbalanced linguistic terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Given that unbalanced LTS is much more general than the symmetrical symbolic linguistic models, in this paper, we shall employ the unbalanced HFLTS to represent the cognitive complex information of decision-makers.</p><p>The existing operations over HFLTSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> are directly based on the subscripts of linguistic terms, and these operations always suppose that the subscripts of linguistic terms are balanced. As debated by Dubois <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> over the computation of the symbolic linguistic models, the ranking of decisions by aggregation of partial ratings on the integer scale depends on the choice of the monotonic mapping function encoding the linguistic values. Regarding the HFLTS, we shall also consider the linguistic scale functions of different linguistic terms.</p><p>To enrich the applicability of cognitive complex linguistic representation models with HFLTSs, similar to the classical computing with words <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the next step is to investigate the methodology to include human source information represented by HFLTSs in formal computer-based decision-making model. However, computing with the HFLTSs is somewhat complicated. To reduce the computational complexity of HFLTSs, Liao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> introduced a score function of HFLTS. However, such a score function can only manipulate the balanced HFLTSs but not the unbalanced HFLTSs.</p><p>Motivated by the above analyses, in this paper, we shall define a novel score function of HFLTS to translate it into numerical values and thus simplify the computational complexity of HFLTSs. The score function of HFLTS based on hesitant degrees and linguistic scale functions (named Score-HeDLiSF, for short) takes into account the hesitant degrees of HFLTSs and the linguistic scale functions for representing the semantics of linguistic terms. It can be used to handle both balanced and unbalanced HFLTSs. In this sense, it includes more information than the other existing score functions of HFLTSs.</p><p>In MEMCDM problems, weighting the evaluations of experts is an important task. The quality of experts' evaluations can be varied based on their knowledge and experience regarding the decision-making problem. In this paper, a hesitant degree-based weighting method is developed as an effective tool to assess the reliability of the experts' evaluations. Furthermore, from a practical point of view in decision-making, we consider the use of the proposed Score-HeDLiSF in designing a MEMCDM model based on the MULTIMOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization on the</p></div>

It is specific with peculiarities of three aggregation models, separately, based on the fully compensatory, the non-compensatory and the incompletely compensatory operators.</p><p>In summary, we intend to achieve the following contributions in this paper:</p><p>(1) We first present a method to calculate the hesitant degree of a HFLTS. Then, we propose a score function named the Score-HeDLiSF for cognitive complex linguistic information considering both the hesitant degree of experts and the linguistic scale functions. The Score-HeDLiSF can handle both the balanced and unbalanced LTSs.</p><p>(2) We introduce some basic operations of the HFLTSs based on the Score-HeDLiSF.</p><p>(3) Afterwards, we develop a hesitant degree-based weighting method to derive the weights of experts.</p><p>(4) We improve the MULTIMOORA method by integrating with the ORESTE method, and then extend it to the HFL context considering the proposed Score-HeDLiSF.</p><p>(5) To validate the proposed HFL-MULTIMOORA method, a case study concerning the selection of optimal shared bicycle brand in Chinese market is provided. Some comparative analyses between the HFL-MULTIMOORA method and other methods are conducted based on the derived results and further from theoretical point of view. The advantages of the HFL-MULTIMOORA method to deal with the MEMCDM problem are highlighted.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 justifies the motivation of this paper in details and then reviews some knowledge of HFLTS and the MULTIMOORA method. The score function of the HFLTS is proposed in Section 3 after introducing the hesitant degrees and the linguistic scale functions of hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements.</p><p>Section 4 presents the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA method. In Section 5, we present a case study for investment management under shared economy. This paper ends with some conclusions and future research directions in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Motivation and Preliminaries</head><p>This section introduces the motivation of this paper and also some knowledge of the HFLTS and the MULTIMOORA method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Motivation</head><p>Most researches on the HFLTS were concentrated on the operations of the uniform subscripts of linguistic terms, such as the addition operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the comparison method between HFLTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the distance measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and the correlation measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In these cases, the deviations between the adjacent linguistic terms are deemed to be equal.</p><p>However, the unbalanced LTSs exist in most practical evaluation problems. Kahneman <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> demonstrated that people make decisions to minimize loss rather than maximize profit. People are more sensitive to loss than gain and thus it is very important to effectively reflect the views of experts from the point of psychology. In this sense, it is necessary to consider the unbalanced situation. Taking the price as an example, since people are sensitive to the low price, the deviation between "high" ( 1 s ) and "very high" ( 2 s ) from our psychology is larger than the deviation between "low"</p><p>( 1 s ÔÄ≠ ) and "medium" ( 0 s ). Based on the antonyms and negation functions, Torra <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> initially discussed the unbalanced semantics for an ordered LTS. Herrera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> investigated the unbalanced LTS and used the 2-tuple linguistic representation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> to deal with the unbalanced linguistic information. Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> presented a simplified unbalanced LTS, denoted as S ÔÄΩ extension on the model of Herrera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for the unbalanced LTSs. To enhance the application, Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> presented a method to process the unbalanced linguistic evaluations based on the proportional form of the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic model. Zhou and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> used an extended sigmoid function with two risk thresholds to translate the linguistic terms into their corresponding semantics and various unbalanced situations can be depicted by changing the thresholds; however, their study fails to represent the unbalanced case that the deviation between two semantics of the adjacent linguistic terms is increased. Pei and Zheng <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed a new unbalanced linguistic scale sets. Cai and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2 { | 1 , (2 ) 3 s t t ÔÅ° ÔÅ° ÔÄΩ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ , 22<label>(3 )</label></formula><p>Gong <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> applied the unbalanced linguistic assessments in group decision-making problems. As for the unbalanced HFLTS, Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> connected the linguistic hierarchy model with the numerical scale by the 2-tuple linguistic representation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and claimed that these two models are equivalent in handling the unbalanced HFLTSs. The orders-of-magnitude reasoning model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is also formulated based on the unbalanced labels. In the HFL context, as far as we know, there is a research gap in intensive studies reflecting the unbalanced LTS. In this regard, this paper tries to fill the existent research gap.</p><p>As we discussed in Introduction, the calculation on HFLTSs is complicated. To facilitate the computation, the score function of HFLTS was introduced by Liao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> based on the idea of averaging the balanced subscripts of linguistic terms in each HFLTSs. However, such kind of score function cannot handle the unbalanced HFLTSs. Durand</p><p>and Truck <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> transformed the hesitant linguistic expressions into symbolic weighted median operators. These achievements are good promotion regarding the transformation of hesitant linguistic model to numerical values for the purpose of calculation. However, each of them have some drawbacks in terms of either the unbalanced representation or the loss of information.</p><p>Based on these concerns, we shall propose a novel score function for balanced and unbalanced HFLTSs. Firstly, it is reasonable to consider the linguistic scale functions of the linguistic terms when transforming the semantic of linguistic terms to numerical values <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. In addition, since more than one linguistic terms are used when making evaluations with HFLTS, the expert shows some degree of hesitation. There is no doubt that the greater the hesitation degree is, the lower the reliability of the HFLTS given by expert should be. Thus, it is necessary to take into account the hesitation degree of the HFLTS in operations. Considering both the linguistic scale functions of linguistic terms and the hesitant degree of experts, a novel score function of HFLTS is introduced to simplify the computations of unbalanced HFLTSs.</p><p>To cope with the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems with the evaluations expressed as HFLTSs, some Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic (HFL) MCDM methods were proposed, such as the HFL-TOPSIS (Technique for Order</p><p>Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and the HFL-VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. These methods aim to calculate the utility value of each alternative by aggregating the values of the alternative over all criteria, and the complete ranking is obtained based on the utility values. These methods are different in terms of the normalization techniques and aggregation models. The HFL-TOPSIS method is based on the vector normalization and arithmetic weighted aggregation operator. Nevertheless, the alternative selected by the HFL-TOPSIS method may be performed badly under some criteria, which violates the decision goal to some extent. To overcome this problem, the HFL-VIKOR method considers the worst values of each alternative under all criteria. However, the result derived from the HFL-VIKOR method is sensitive to the relative importance between two aggregation models used in the HFL-VIKOR. The MULTIMOORA is a relatively new MCDM method proposed by Brauers and Zavadskas <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. It is specific with peculiarities of three aggregation models, separately, based on the fully compensatory, the non-compensatory and the incompletely compensatory operators. The MULTIMOORA method is straightforward for decision-makers due to its simple mathematics; however, its result is robust by simultaneously</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Information Fusion 6 of 31</formula><p>considering the subordinate ranks derived from the three aggregation models. Chakraborty <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> illustrated the superiority of the MULTIMOORA method by some comparative analyses with other MCDM methods. However, there is a research gap concerning the MULTIMOORA method with the evaluations expressed in HFLTSs.</p><p>In addition, for MEMCDM problems, it is necessary to aggregate individuals' opinions into a collective one.</p><p>Different weights should be assigned to different individuals given that they have different levels of understanding about the problems. Specifically, some individuals may be familiar with some criteria but not familiar with others, which makes it hard to subjectively determine their actual weights. In this sense, we can determine the individuals' weights objectively according to the quality of their evaluations. It is natural that the greater the hesitant degree of a HFLE is, the lower the reliability of this evaluation could be, and thus the lower weight should be assigned to the individual. Therefore, based on the introduced hesitant degree of HFLE, in this paper, we take the combined comprehensive hesitant degrees of the decision matrix and the preference relation given by the individual as his weight.</p><p>Another problem concerning the MULTIMOORA is how to effectively summarize the results derived from the three aggregation models. In the classical MULTIMOORA, the dominance theory is used to integrate the three subordinate ranks into the comprehensive ranking list <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. It aims to make pairwise comparisons of alternatives among the orders derived by three subordinate models. However, there are some limitations when using the dominance theory:</p><p>(1) The optimal alternative can be found by the dominance theory but the ranks of alternatives are hard to be determined;</p><p>(2) the relative importance of three subordinate models are ignored in the dominance theory; (3) it is difficult to catch a satisfactory outcome with the dominance theory if the number of alternatives is large due to the complex pairwise comparison process; (4) the theory sometimes leads to circular reasoning, which means, same final rankings may be obtained and such cases may not be satisfactory. To fill this gap, we introduce a ranking method, ORESTE, into MULTIMMORA to derive the final ranking. The ORESTE, originally proposed by Roubens <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, is an effective ranking-based MCDM method with less evaluation information, including only the importance orders of criteria and the performances of alternatives under the criteria. It is effective to integrate the initial rankings of each alternative under all criteria to derive the final ranking of alternatives. The criteria weights are also considered by ORESTE and expressed as initial rankings, which are easy to be determined.</p></div>

Firstly, the linguistic scale functions of linguistic terms including balanced and unbalanced cases are analyzed. Then, the hesitant degree of HFLE is defined in Section 3.2 to measure the reliability of the given information. Finally, the Score-HeDLiSF is proposed based on the linguistic scale functions and the hesitant degrees of HFLTSs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Linguistic scale functions</head><p>When making evaluations, experts judge in linguistic terms directly rather than their corresponding semantics. In this case, there are two models to infuse experts' linguistic evaluations: (1) the semantic model which works on the fuzzy numbers associated to the semantics and uses the extension principle for aggregation; (2) the symbolic model which works on the indexes of the linguistic labels. One significant defect of the semantic model is that the result of this model is a fuzzy number and thus an approximation process is needed to associate the numerical results with the predefined linguistic labels. Apparently, such an approximation process would lead to information loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In analogous to the semantic model, the symbolic model which acts on the label indexes directly also needs an approximation process as addressed in Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>'s translation and retranslation model. Considering that the loss of information is caused by the need to express the results in the initial discrete expression domain via an approximation process, Herrera and Martinez <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> introduced the 2-tuple linguistic representation model to avoid information loss in the computing with words process based on the concept of "linguistic translation". Later, Herrera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> extended the 2-tuple linguistic representation model to handle unbalanced linguistic term sets. Keeping in mind that the key task of the 2-tuple linguistic representation model is to define a function that establishes a one-to-one mapping between the linguistic label and numerical values, Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> proposed an extension of the 2-tuple linguistic representation model by means of the concept numerical scale. Even though the symbolic models have obtained good performance in computing with words, one debate from Dubois <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is related to the choice of the monotonic mapping encoding the linguistic values. In other words, we should assign an appropriate semantic to each linguistic term and distinguish the balanced and unbalanced LTSs based on experts' psychology. However, how to systematically consider the balanced and unbalanced situations and define the semantics in different situations are challenging. This can be done by the linguistic scale functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Other possible proposals include Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>'s generic ordering set on linguistic scales,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Information Fusion 9 of 31</formula><p>personalized individual semantics based on the numerical scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and ordered qualitative scales using proximity measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The hesitant degree of hesitant fuzzy linguistic element</head><p>Hesitant degree is the intrinsic information of each HFLE since there can be more than one linguistic term in it. For example, when making evaluation, expert may give his/her linguistic evaluation as "good", 1 {} s , without any hesitation; he/she may also give his/her evaluation as "between medium and very good", 0 1 2 { , , } s s s , with some degree of hesitation.

In this way, we can avoid the biased results caused by the low reliability information. Based on the preference matrix and the comprehensive hesitant degree of HFLE, we can calculate another weight of expert q e , shown as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">ÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ© () 11 () () 1 1 1 1 0.5 ( , )<label>( 1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_63">1 0.5 ( , )<label>( 1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_64">nn q S j k jk q Q nn q S j k q j k HD h c c nn w HD h c c nn ÔÄΩÔÄΩ ÔÄΩ ÔÄΩ ÔÄΩ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÇ¢ ÔÄΩ ÔÉ¶ÔÉ∂ ÔÄ≠ ÔÉßÔÉ∑ ÔÄ≠ ÔÉ®ÔÉ∏ ÔÉ•ÔÉ• ÔÉ• ÔÉ•ÔÉ• , jk ÔÇπ<label>(18)</label></formula><p>It is noted that Eq.

It is possible that sometimes these two groups of experts may be different, that is, one group of experts are invited to evaluate the importance of criteria and the other group of experts are invited to evaluate the alternatives based on the given criteria.</p><p>The collective weight of each criterion can be obtained by aggregating the subordinate criteria weights derived from the experts' preference matrices with respect to the weights of different experts.

It may be unsuitable to handle the criteria whose values are expressed in different units. For instance, the unit of price can be dollor or million dollors. Different normalized values will be obtained by the vector normalization approach when using different units for a criterion. However, vector normalization is effective to deal with the qualiative criteria since their values are expressed as dimensionless linguitsic terms. Therefore, under the hesitant linguistic environment, the vector normalization method is utilized to normalize the collective decision matrix shown as Eq. ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>).</p><p>The normalized score of the HFLE ij S h is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">ÔÄ® ÔÄ© 2 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) m N ij ij ij S S S i E h E h E h ÔÄΩ ÔÄΩ ÔÉ•<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">() ij S Eh</formula><p>is the score of ij S h calculated by Eq.

The arithmetic weighted aggregation operator is utilized in the ratio system. In this model, the small normalized values of an alternative can be completely compensated by the same degree of large values. That is to say, an alternative which performs badly under some criteria and performs well under other criteria can be replaced by the alternative which performs moderately under all criteria. However, we intend to select the latter alternative with a less risk in practical problems. To meet this fact, the MULTIMOORA method further uses the reference point approach to find the worst value of each alternative with respect to all criteria. We prefer to select the alternative whose worst value under all criteria is not very bad. Furthermore, the geometric weighted aggregation operator is employed in the full multiplicative form of the MULTIMOORA method. In this model, the small normalized values of an alternative cannot be completely compensated by the same degree of large values. This idea fits people's cognition that the alternative with moderate performances is superior to the alternative which has both very good and very bad performances under different criteria. To make the result robust, the final ranking is derived by consolidating the three subordinate ranks obtained by the aggregation models.

The unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA method is utilized to solve this problem. The advantages of the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA are highlighted by some comparative analyses with some other decision-making methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Case description</head><p>With the development of online big data and the popularization of smart phones, a new mode of economic, collaborative consumption, is becoming a hot topic and has attracted much attention. The essence of sharing economy is using idle resources to make the supply match the demand better, and creating greater value for users. Therefore, the sharing economy has been developing rapidly in various fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, and a series of new concepts such as shared bicycles, shared charging treasure and shared umbrellas have been proposed. At the same time, the change of consumption ideas provides the development of shared economy with more opportunities. Sharing economy has already been a hot issue of research in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. It has gradually become a profit margin. The huge market attracted a lot of investors <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Driven by capital, it seems that the shared economy can be expanded to any industry. However, what products are suitable for sharing and what products are illusory shared? This is a critical problem for investors to consider before investing. Besides, after fierce competition, a few leading enterprises can survive in each industry. How to select an excellent shared company to invest also becomes a key problem for investors. This is a typical MEMCDM bicycle sharing is becoming increasingly popular among customers, especially among the younger generation due to its convenience and cheap rental fees. Shared bicycle has become a focus of market since it provides a solution to the "last mile" problem of city traffic.</p><p>As the market for bicycle sharing has gradually opened up, it has attracted more than 30 investment institutions, and the financing in 2017 has exceeded 6 billion Chinese Yuan. Capital is massively invested in bicycle sharing.</p><p>Investment agencies point out that the bicycle sharing market will reach 10 billion Yuan in the future, and the total number of users will reach 50 million, or even 100 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. At the same time, the Chinese government strongly supports the development of bicycle sharing industry due to the low carbon emissions. However, with the competition in bicycle sharing, market becoming fiercer, more and more bicycle sharing companies get into trouble. For example, the "Wu Kong Bike", "Blue Go Go" have stopped operations in June 2017 ‚Ä† . Some insiders predict that the future direction of the bicycle sharing industry is poised to undergo a major consolidation. Therefore, it is of great significance for the investor to choose a company with a promising future, which can avoid failure of investment and gain profits in the future.</p><p>According to the popularity, number of employees, scale of enterprise assets and operating conditions which can be found out through the internet, we select four representative shared bicycle companies including "Mobike" ( 1 a ), "OFO" ( 2 a ), "Green Orange" ( 3 a ) and "Hello Bike" ( 4 a ). The APPs of these companies have been mostly downloaded over the past two years in China.</p><p>An enterprise worth investing can show great potential for competition and further growth in the long period of operations on the basis of their dominance over the status of industry, technique monopoly advantage and efficient management system. These potentials can deliver considerable returns for investors. Therefore, the evaluation of an enterprise worth investing or not depends on the market competitiveness, company size, product technical ability and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. In this sense, we select the following five criteria to judge the shared bicycle companies.</p><p>ÔÉò Technology research and development capability 1 c : The advanced technology and the number of patents in terms of bicycle sharing.</p><p>ÔÉò The ability to design and perform operational process 2 c : Whether the whole operation of an enterprise is normal or not is determined by the rationality and executive capability of the whole operational procedure of an enterprise.</p><p>ÔÉò The product competitiveness 3 c : It mainly comes in two aspects, the product design and the production capacity, which are the fundamental for an enterprise to develop.</p><p>ÔÉò The scale of company 4 c : It refers to the quantity of capital, market shares and the total income in recent years.</p><p>ÔÉò The ability to control public relations and policy research 5 c : It is shown up as an enterprise's brand image and how they handle emergencies specifically.</p><p>Four experts q e ( 1, 2,3, 4 q ÔÄΩ ) are invited to make evaluations over the four bicycle sharing companies over the above five criteria. The LTS for judging the companies with respect to the five criteria is determined as multiple choices according to their hesitant perceptions.

To limit variables for reasonable explanation, we compare the criteria weights derived by the hesitant degree-based aggregation method proposed in this paper and the union-based aggregation method proposed by Rodr√≠guez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The only difference between these methods is the way to aggregate experts' opinions into a collective one. The union-based aggregation method aims to aggregate all different linguistic terms given by all experts for an object without considering different weights among experts. The steps to derive criteria weights by the union-based aggregation method are given as below.</p><p>Aggregate four experts' HFLEs by the union method shown as:  There are some differences between the criteria weights derived by different weight determining methods. From four individual preference relations, we can find that the hesitant degrees of experts 1 e and 4 e are large, and they have low consensus with other experts. From the collective preference relation, we can also find that the collective opinions have large uncertainty. If we calculate the criteria weights based on the large uncertainty and some prejudice opinions, the reliability of the results is low. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the hesitant degree of the evaluations and derive experts' weights. The experts whose evaluations are with high uncertainty should be assigned a low weight.</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">ÔÅª ÔÅΩ (1) (2) (3) (4) (1) (2) (3) (4) | ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij S S</formula><formula xml:id="formula_93">ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄ≠ ÔÄΩ ÔÅª ÔÅΩ ÔÅª ÔÅΩ ÔÅª ÔÅΩ ÔÅª ÔÅΩ ÔÅª ÔÅΩ ÔÅª ÔÅΩ ÔÅª ÔÅΩ 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 0 3 2 1 0 3 2 1 0 0 , , ,<label>(26)</label></formula><p>(</p></div>

The utility values of different alternatives are different if we use different linguistic scale functions to calculate the semantics. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) is suitable for the balanced situation, which is the same as the symmetric-subscript-based calculations. This operation method is utilized in many papers related to HFLTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. However, the unbalanced situations always exist when we make assessments in linguistic expressions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(3) Solution based on the HFL-TOPSIS method and the HFL-VIKOR method</head><p>This part concentrates on proving the reliability of the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA method compared with the HFL-TOPSIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and the HFL-VIKOR method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We also consider the hesitant degree and the unbalanced situations of the HFLEs when using the HFL-TOPSIS and the HFL-VIKOR methods to solve the case presented in Section 5.1. We use the same criteria weights which are calculated by the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA method.</p><p>The vector normalization technique is utilized in the TOPSIS method. The normalized decision matrix regarding the HFL-TOPSIS method is the same as the normalized decision matrix used in unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA.

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">11</ref> shows the results derived by the HFL-VIKOR method. Comparative analysis: All above methods indicate that the optimal investment shared bike is "Mobike". Therefore, the investor can select this company to join in with low risk. However, there are some differences about the order of all alternatives derived by different methods. We aim to compare these MEMCDM methods from the theoretical level and provide the reasons for different results. The HFL-TOPSIS method only aggregates alternatives' normalized values on different criteria by the arithmetic weighted aggregation operator, which is similar to UHFLRS model in the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA. This similarity can be verified in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">9</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_24">11</ref>. The utility values derived by the HFL-TOPSIS method are similar to the subordinate utility values calculated by the UHFLRS model. But, the HFL-TOPSIS method ignores to consider the worst performance of each alternative. The alternative which performs badly under some criteria may be selected by the HFL-TOPSIS method. In the case of this paper, the utility value of 3 a is somewhat larger than the value of 4 a but they are closer. The relation 34 aa is judged by the HFL-TOPSIS method. However, 3 a performs poorly under criterion 4 c , and 4 a performs moderately under all criteria. From our cognition, 4 a is superior to 3 a . If 3 a is selected rather than a , we have to take a greater risk. Although, this point is considered in the HFL-VIKOR method, how to summarize the group utility value and the individual regret value of each alternative is an open problem. The results are sensitive by the threshold ÔÅ± . This problem can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">11</ref>. It is hard for experts to select an appropriate value of the threshold when making decision. After calculating the group utility value and the individual regret value, in the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA, the ORESTE is introduced to integrate the subordinate ranks derived by three models. The results are not sensitive to the different relative importance of the three models (see <ref type="bibr">Table 10)</ref>. It shows that the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA is a robust approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>The HFLTS is a useful tool in representing cognitive complex linguistic information. However, how to calculate the HFLTSs is still an open question. In this paper, we addressed the score function of HFLTS to translate it into numerical values. The Score-HeDLiSF was proposed based on the hesitant degrees and the linguistic scale functions of HFLTS.</p><p>Such a new score function can be used to handle both the balanced and unbalanced HFLTSs. It also includes more information than the other existing score functions of the HFLTSs.</p><p>An integrated MEMCDM method, namely the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA, was proposed based on the hesitant degree-based weighting method and the ORESTE method with the help of the Score-HeDLiSF. Given that the bicycle-sharing service is a hot shared market in China, we further handled a practical case study concerning the shared bicycles investment using the proposed method. We constructed an evaluation criteria system for evaluating the shared bicycle brands. After some comparative analyses with other MEMCDM methods, the advantages of the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA are highlighted as:</p><p>(1) It is easy and flexible for experts to make evaluations in linguistic expressions. Both the simple and complex linguistic evaluations can be depicted by the HFLTSs, which guarantees the accuracy of the evaluation information.</p><p>(2) For reasonable operations, we presented a score function, Score-HeDLiSF, of HFLTS. Both the balanced and unbalanced LTSs are considered based on the psychology. The limitation of the operations based on symmetric subscripts of linguistic terms is eliminated in the unbalanced HFLTS.</p><p>(3) Experts' weights were considered based on their hesitant degrees.</p><p>(4) Each expert judges the importance of criteria by pairwise comparisons, which is an easy work compared with evaluating the importance degree of each criterion directly. The hesitant degrees were also considered to aggregate the opinions of all experts.</p><p>(5) The decision results are reliable and robust. Three aggregation models with different functions were utilized in the proposed extension of MULTIMOORA method. Furthermore, three types of subordinate ranks were effectively integrated by the ORESTE method which is more robust comparing the dominance theory used in the original MULTIMOORA.</p><p>In the future, we shall further systematically analyze the unbalanced situation in linguistic evaluation problems and put forward other linguistic scale functions. Retranslating the calculated results to common sense language is also an open question.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, 0, , ( 3) 44 tt ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ , 2 ( 2), 1} 3 tt ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ .
