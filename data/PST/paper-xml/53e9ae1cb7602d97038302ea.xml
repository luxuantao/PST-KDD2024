<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper provides a logical basis for manipulation with fuzzy IF-THEN rules. Our theory is wide enough and it encompasses not only finding a conclusion by means of the compositional rule of inference due to Lotfi A. Zadeh but also other kinds of approximate reasoning methods, e.g., perception-based deduction, provided that there exists a possibility to characterize them within a formal logical system. In contrast with other approaches employing variants of multiple-valued first-order logic, the approach presented here employs fuzzy type theory of V. Novák which has sufficient expressive power to present the essential concepts and results in a compact, elegant and justifiable form. Within the effectively formalized representation developed here, based on a complete logical system, it is possible to reconstruct numerous well-known properties of CRI-related fuzzy inference methods, albeit not from the analytic point of view as usually presented, but as formal derivations of the logical system employed. The authors are confident that eventually all relevant knowledge about fuzzy inference methods based on fuzzy IF-THEN rule bases will be represented, formalized and backed up by proof within the well-founded logical representation presented here. An immediate positive consequence of this approach is that suddenly all elements of a fuzzy inference method based on fuzzy IF-THEN rules are 'first class citizenś of the representation: there are clear, logically founded definitions for fuzzy IF-THEN rule bases to be consistent, complete, or independent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This paper has been inspired by the works of Thiele <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, who proposed to use the concepts of logic such as model, consistency, extension, consequence and others for the analysis of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. Our main goal in this paper is to formalize the meaning of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. There is an extensive literature devoted to this task (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and elsewhere). Fuzzy IF-THEN rules are usually taken as specific characterization of dependencies among objects. The basic tool is then either pure fuzzy set theory or the predicate fuzzy logic. For example, Hájek in his book <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> developed a theory of fuzzy IF-THEN rules within many-sorted first-order BL-fuzzy logic extended by a special binary fuzzy equivalence predicate. Similarly, Perfilieva shows in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> that sets of fuzzy IF-THEN rules can be modelled using special formulas of fuzzy predicate logic being generalization of the classical boolean conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms. The goal in these and similar works is to provide a working theory suitable for technical applications, the main problem of which is to find a sufficiently precise approximation of some function. It should be stressed that none of the cited authors considered fuzzy IF-THEN rules as linguistic expressions.</p><p>For the advanced applications, for example in robotics or artificial intelligence, however, it is a challenge to take fuzzy IF-THEN rules as genuine expressions of natural language and to capture their meaning from this point of view. A good reason for this effort is the goal to develop human-like behaving robots. First-order predicate logic, however, is insufficient for this task because it does not allow to formalize the concepts of intension and extension. Though fuzzy IF-THEN rules have fairly simple linguistic structure and so, first-order logic can sometimes overcome this problem, further extension to more complicated linguistic phenomena would hardly be possible. This is the main reason why we decided to employ the fuzzy type theory (FTT) of Novák <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> which has sufficient expressive power to present the essential concepts and results in a compact, elegant and justifiable form. Our wider goal is to develop a concise and sufficiently general theory of the fuzzy IF-THEN rules that would encompass not only the above mentioned technical means for approximation of functions but also formalization of the linguistic meaning of these rules when taken as special expressions of natural language. Our theory also fits well the idea of developing a precisiated natural language (PNL) presented by Zadeh in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, i.e., to find a reasonable mathematical model of the meaning of a certain subset of natural language expressions that could be used in various applications and that would at the same time comply with the human way of understanding them.</p><p>When dealing with the meaning of fuzzy IF-THEN rules, one cannot avoid the problem of solvability of fuzzy relation equations. This theory has been originated by Sanchez in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and further elaborated by many authors, for example DiNola et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Gottwald <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Gottwald et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Klawonn <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, Novák et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Perfilieva and Lehmke <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, Perfilieva and Tonis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and others. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> show that the problem of solvability of fuzzy relation equations has a deeper meaning, namely that it corresponds to consistency of the description of the given problem. These results became motivation for part of our analysis contained in this paper. We will show that this problem is connected with inherent meaning of the text (we speak about implicit intension of the linguistic description). Having sound formal logical theory at disposal, we may study its relation to the meaning (intension) of the rules themselves. Moreover, we may introduce clear, logically founded definitions for fuzzy IF-THEN rule bases to be consistent, complete, or independent and to consider also dependent IF-THEN rules that can be derived from rule bases (and so, be proved to be redundant).</p><p>Our theory is wide enough and it encompasses not only finding a conclusion by means of the compositional rule of inference due to Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> but also other kinds of approximate reasoning methods, e.g., the perception-based logical deduction (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>), provided that it is possible to characterize them within a formal logical system. Within the effectively formalized representation developed here (based on a complete logical system), it is possible to reconstruct numerous well-known properties of CRI-related fuzzy inference methods, albeit not from the analytic point of view as usually presented, but as formal derivations of the logical system employed.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: first we characterize the fuzzy IF-THEN rules as special linguistic expressions starting with their components. In Section 4 we briefly remind some main concepts of the FTT. However, for full understanding to this paper, we suppose the reader to be acquainted with the papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Section 5 is devoted to formalization of the meaning of a single fuzzy IF-THEN rule and the following section to formalization of the meaning of systems of them.</p><p>It is important to stress that our paper in a certain sense summarizes and systematizes results scattered over the literature on fuzzy IF-THEN rules and also the related problem of fuzzy relation equations. Most theorems are proved syntactically, some of them are syntactical formulation of the known properties that were derived on the basis of more narrow assumptions and often without logical considerations. Our results often contribute to deeper understanding of the given phenomenon in a wider context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preliminaries</head><p>By a fuzzy set we mean a function A : U -→ L where U is a universe and L is a support of a given structure of truth values. The latter set coincides with the set of truth values for the FTT (see Section 4). To express that A is a fuzzy set in U, we will sometimes write A ⊂ ∼ U . A (binary) fuzzy relation is a fuzzy set R ⊂ ∼ U × V , i.e., a function R : U × V -→ L.</p><p>The composition of a fuzzy set A ⊂ ∼ U and a fuzzy relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R ⊂ ∼ U × V is a fuzzy set B ⊂ ∼ V given by B(v) = u∈U (A(u) ⊗ R(u, v)), (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where ⊗ is a suitable product operation (a t-norm)-see Section 4. We usually write (1) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">B = A • R. (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>A fuzzy relation equation is Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) for the unknown fuzzy relation R. If such R exists then we say that the fuzzy relation equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) is solvable.</p><p>Let a set of couples of fuzzy sets A i , B i , i = 1, . . . , m be given.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Fuzzy IF-THEN rules as special linguistic expressions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Adjectival predications</head><p>In this paper, we will consider a specific part of natural language, namely adjectival clauses and adjectival predications. Adjectival clause consists of an adjective and, possibly, a modifier. For example, red, very big, full of spare parts, rather sad, totally empty, roughly medium, etc.</p><p>A significant constituent of adjectival clauses is formed by the, so called, evaluating linguistic expressions (e.g., very small, extremely long, roughly medium, etc.) that are special expressions used for characterization of a position on some bounded ordered scale (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>). Note that we may also consider adjectival phrases <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> that are phrases with an adjective as their head (e.g., full of spare parts). Adjectival phrases and clauses are, in essence, names of properties of objects.</p><p>Adjectival clauses and phrases may occur as premodifiers to a noun (a very tall man, a container full of spare parts), or as adjectival predications, i.e., expressions affiliating adjectives to a noun, for example the temperature is very high, the container is full of spare parts, my friend is extremely intelligent, etc. We will take both these expressions as synonymous and, in the sequel, deal with adjectival predications only. We will not go into further details of their structure since they are unnecessary for the general theory of fuzzy IF-THEN rules discussed further. Throughout this paper, we will denote the considered expressions of natural language by script letters A, B, R, . . .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1.</head><p>(i) Let A be an adjectival clause. The linguistic expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">noun is A (4)</formula><p>is an adjectival predication. (ii) Let Ā and B be adjectival predications. Then the following are compound adjectival predications:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(a) R A := Ā and B, 4 (b) R O := Ā or B, (c) R I := IF Ā THEN B.</formula><p>In the case of R I , the part before THEN is called antecedent and after it consequent (possibly also succedent). Note that in more complicated cases, the antecedent may be formed from R A as well as R O , for example "IF temperature is high or pressure is very low THEN . . .", or "IF road is wide and very well preserved or bridge is new or strong THEN . . .", etc.</p><p>By S, we denote the set of linguistic expressions consisting of adjectival clauses and adjectival predications. Note that in the applications of fuzzy logic, only that part of S consisting of evaluating linguistic expressions and predications is till now employed (mostly without the attempt to penetrate into their linguistic meaning).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Fuzzy IF-THEN rules</head><p>The ' noun ' is often unimportant in the applications. Therefore, we will replace it by some variable X whose values are not the objects themselves but only their features, such as height, volume, tension, size, abstract degrees of beauty, temperature, etc. This leads us to the concept of a fuzzy IF-THEN rule which is a kind of "abstracted" compound adjectival predication. Definition 2. By fuzzy IF-THEN rule we understand either of the compound adjectival predications R I and R A taken in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R A := X is A AND Y is B, (5) R I := IF X is A THEN Y is B, (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where X, Y represent features of objects.</p><p>The adjectival predications R A and R I linguistically characterize (or express existence of) some relation between arbitrary objects x and y named by the respective nouns, that have properties named by A and B, respectively.</p><p>The difference between R A and R I consists in the extent of their operation. If we analyse their meaning, we find that R I characterizes an arbitrary (conditional) relation. This means that if objects represented by X have the property named by A then they are in relation with objects represented by Y which have the property named by B; if the objects X do not have A then the relation with the objects Y is accepted but not further specified. Moreover, the objects Y are determined or influenced by the objects X via this relation (we usually say that X is independent and Y dependent variable).</p><p>On the other hand, R A characterizes only positive part of such relation, i.e., just objects having the property named by A are in relation with objects having the property named by B. Thus, R A can be understood as a special (essential) part of R I . Of course, fuzzy IF-THEN rules are intrinsically vague and so, the relation may not be characterized precisely by them.</p><p>The reader may be embarrassed that we call R A also a fuzzy IF-THEN rule despite the fact that it is a (symmetric) conjunction of adjectival predications. We think that this is a certain linguistic licence since, as explained, in both cases we characterize some relation in which independent and dependent constituents are clearly distinguished. As explained above, R A can be, moreover, understood a part of R I and consequently, taken as nonsymmetric. We must admit, however, that this justification is based on informal semantic arguments and from the formal point of view, R A is indeed symmetric. We are unable to fix this problem more satisfactorily on the present stage of knowledge.</p><p>The symbols R A and R I will be used as metavariables for the corresponding forms of fuzzy IF-THEN rules ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and (6), respectively. If the concrete form of a fuzzy IF-THEN rule is unimportant then we simply write R.</p><p>In addition, we may also introduce a simplified form of the compound adjectival predication R O by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R O := X is A OR Y is B. (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>This predication, however, characterizes a very weak form of a relation between X and Y and so, we will not take it as a fuzzy IF-THEN rule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Topic and focus of fuzzy IF-THEN rules</head><p>One of the most important linguistic phenomena is division of the linguistic meaning of sentences into topic and focus. Informally, the topic is the theme, i.e., what is spoken about while focus is that part which conveys a new information.</p><p>Every sentence is assumed to have a focus since otherwise it could not convey relevant information. However, there can be sentences without topic. The division into topic and focus for one sentence is not unique. It depends on several aspects, which we will not discuss here. Let us only remark that this fact is one of the sources of extreme power of natural language to characterize real world phenomena. The interested reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</p><p>Since the fuzzy IF-THEN rules are also special natural language sentences, they have topic and focus. Their structure, of course, is very simple and so, we can define them unambiguously as follows.</p><p>Definition 3. Let R be a fuzzy IF-THEN rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Then its topic is formed by the adjectival predication 'X is A' and its focus by 'Y is B'.</p><p>Let us remark that the surface form of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is symmetric and so, it may be doubtful, what is topic and what focus. The clue lays in the above discussed distinction between independent and dependent variable. Hence, the topic is always formed by the part of fuzzy IF-THEN rule, that gives evidence about independent variable. Of course, this cannot follow from the rule itself but from the wider sense given by a more structured text. Since these questions are out of the scope of this paper, we suppose that the information on which variable is independent and which dependent is given from outside.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Fuzzy type theory</head><p>The main tool for the logical analysis of fuzzy IF-THEN rules in this paper is the FTT. In this section, we will very briefly overview some of the main points of the FTT. The detailed explanation of FTT can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. The classical type theory is in details described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>

The primitive symbols are variables x , . . . , special constants c , . . . , <ref type="bibr">(o )</ref> , o(oo) (description operators), the symbol and various kinds of brackets.

On the other hand, to make the notation more transparent, we will often write in advance that, e.g., x ∈ Form and then write simply x instead of x . Note that in FTT, all elements of the syntax are formulas (in the literature, formulas are quite often called -terms, instead) including variables or connectives.</p><p>Formulas of type o (truth value) can be joined by the following connectives (i.e., also formulas): (g) Special connectives</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∨ ∨ ∨ := x o ( y o (((x o ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ y o ) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ y o ) ∧ ((y o ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ x o ) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ x o ))), (disjunction) &amp; &amp; &amp; := x o ( y o (¬ ¬ ¬(x o ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ ¬ ¬ ¬y o ))), (strong conjunction) ∇ ∇ ∇ := x o ( y o (¬ ¬ ¬(¬ ¬ ¬A o &amp; &amp; &amp; ¬ ¬ ¬B o ))).</formula><p>(strong disjunction)</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(h) General quantifier (∀x )A o := ( x A o ≡ x ) and existential quantifier (∃x )A o := ¬ ¬ ¬(∀x )¬ ¬ ¬A o .</formula><p>For the details about their semantics see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Notation</head><p>To simplify the notation as much as possible, which means especially to minimize the number of brackets, we will use the following conventions in the sequel.</p><p>Priority of logical connectives:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(1) ¬ ¬ ¬, . (2) &amp; &amp; &amp;, ∇ ∇ ∇. (3) ∧ ∧ ∧, ∨ ∨ ∨. (4) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒. (5) ≡. (6) global connectives ∧ ∧ ∧, ∨ ∨ ∨.</formula><p>Furthermore, we will also use the dot convention as follows: the formula A • B is equivalent to A(B). For example, the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">x • Ax ∧ ∧ ∧ •Bx ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ C is equivalent to x(Ax ∧ ∧ ∧ (Bx ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ C)).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The structure of truth values</head><p>The structure of truth values for FTT is supposed to form a complete IMTL -algebra (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), which is a complete residuated lattice</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">L = L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, , 0, 1<label>(8)</label></formula><p>fulfilling the prelinearity condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">(a → b) ∨ (b → a) = 1, a,b ∈ L,</formula><p>and, moreover, its negation function ¬a = a → 0 is involutive, i.e., ¬¬a = a holds for all a ∈ L. The (Baaz) is a special unary operation of 0 -1 projection. For its general definition, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.

An example of left-continuous t-norm with involutive negation is nilpotent minimum.</p><p>In this paper we suppose L to have a stronger structure, namely, that of MV algebra. Even more, we will suppose it to be just Łukasiewicz MV -algebra (i.e., the standard MV algebra on [0, 1]; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>).

At the same time, be aware that a lot of propositions presented below hold also in IMTL -algebra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Syntax</head><p>The syntax of FTT consists of definitions of fundamental formulas, axioms and inference rules. A more detailed presentation would be too extensive and so, we will repeat only some of the main points.</p><p>The IMTL -FTT has 17 axioms that may be divided into the following subsets: fundamental equality axioms, truth structure axioms, quantifier axioms and axioms of descriptions.</p><p>Fundamental equality axioms are the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">(FT I 1) (x ≡ y ) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ (f x ≡ f y ), (FT I 2 1 ) (∀x )(f x ≡ g x ) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ (f ≡ g ), (FT I 2 2 ) (f ≡ g ) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ (f x ≡ g x ), (FT I 3) ( x B )A ≡ C</formula><p>where C is obtained from B by replacing all free occurrences of x in it by A , provided that A is substitutable to B for x (lambda conversion),</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">(FT I 4) (x ≡ y ) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ ((y ≡ z ) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ (x ≡ z )).</formula><p>Further axioms characterize the structure of truth values. These axioms (altogether 11) assure that the predicate IMTL fuzzy logic with the connective is included in FTT, i.e., all theorems of the former are provable also in FTT. For the case of Ł-FTT (Łukasiewicz FTT), these axioms cover the Rose-Roser's axioms of Łukasiewicz logic (for the details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>).</p><p>Specific and important axiom for provability properties among them is the axiom</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">(FT I 6) (A o ≡ ) ≡ A o .</formula><p>The quantifier axiom is</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">(FT I 16) (∀x )(A o ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ B o ) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ (A o ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ (∀x )B o ) where x is not free in A o .</formula><p>A special constant used in FTT is the description operator (o ) . For its interpretation see below. The description operator is tied with the fuzzy equality E (o ) by means of the following axioms of descriptions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">(FT I 17) (o ) (E (o ) y ) ≡ y , = o, .</formula><p>There are two inference rules in FTT, namely: A theory T is a set of formulas of type o (determined by a subset of special axioms, as usual). Provability is defined as usual. If T is a theory and A o a formula then T ٛA o means that A o is provable in T. Note that the inference rules of modus ponens and generalization are derived rules of FTT. Note also, that Ł-FTT is not supposed to contain logical constants (names of truth values) as is, e.g., in Ev Ł (fuzzy logic with evaluated syntax)-see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Introduction</head><p>Our main goal in this paper is to formalize the meaning of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. As mentioned in the Introduction, there already exist formal logical theories of them (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>). However, none of them covers their linguistic meaning and, in fact, it describes only extensions (see below). More focus on the linguistic side of the fuzzy IF-THEN rules can be found in the book <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The theory of their meaning is there also formed within first-order fuzzy logic, but in the generalized form that adds evaluation to formulas also on the syntactic level (we speak about fuzzy logic with evaluated syntax). It is demonstrated that this logic can already capture the distinction between intension and extension. The formalism is clear but more complicated. Because further extension of these theories to more complicated linguistic phenomena is hardly possible we decided to use FTT in this paper.</p><p>First, we will fix some formal language J of FTT. For our explanation, it is unnecessary to define explicitly all its special symbols. Therefore, when writing A ∈ J for some symbol A we silently assume that such a symbol has already been introduced in the language J.</p><p>Furthermore, we will suppose to work in some formal theory T of FTT within the language J. This means that certain specific formulas are provable in T. However, we will not specify explicitly axioms of T since we do not need them. Hence, T is arbitrary formal theory in which the formulas in concern are provable. If the reader feels uncomfortable with this, he/she may assume that if a new formula is said to be provable but without explicit reference to its proof then it can be just taken as an axiom of T.</p><p>To simplify notation, we will use special variables (formulas) for specific types only. Namely, we will introduce special types , , . . . for contexts (possible worlds) and use variables w, w , . . . for formulas of this type, i.e., w ∈ Form , w ∈ Form , . . . . More precise explanation is provided in Sections 5.6 and 5.7. Furthermore, variables x, y are always formulas of some types , , . . . that represent objects of various kinds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Intension of adjectival clauses</head><p>When speaking about meaning of an adjectival clause, we must distinguish between its intension and extension. We will follow the generally accepted way how these concepts are mathematically modelled (cf., e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and elsewhere), i.e., intension is a function assigning to each possible world and to each object a truth value. In other words, each possible world is assigned a class of objects. Extension is then the class of objects in a concrete possible world. This simple idea fits the requirement that intension does not depend on a concrete possible world while extension does. For the reasons that become clear later, we will prefer the term context to possible world.</p><p>Let A be an adjectival clause. We will interpret it by a formula A ∈ Form (o ) which represents a function assigning to each context (possible world) a fuzzy set.

This simplification enables us to simplify also the model of meaning of the adjectival predications. For example, a small object, say a tree, a man, a barrel, etc. means that some feature measured on it (for example, size, volume, etc.) is close to a certain minimal value (e.g., 0). Similarly, green means that some feature (i.e., wavelength of the reflected light) falls in a fuzzy set of wavelengths that characterize the property of being "green" (something around 560 nm). Quite analogous reasoning can be made for other adjectives and adjectival clauses, such as full, very large, not too intelligent, extremely tasty, etc. Note that concrete objects are involved not directly but vicariously by their features!</p><p>The linguistic predication "X is A" should be read as "each value of X has the property named by A".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Formal definition of contexts</head><p>Let us now discuss the meaning of the elements w ∈ W . In the literature on intensional logic (cf., for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>), w is taken as a possible world. This term has various interpretations such as "a state of the world at the given time moment and place", "the particular context in which the linguistic expression is used", or "a maximal consistent set of known (possible) facts". All of these interpretations are very wide and rough characterizations which can be arbitrarily specified to more and more details. However, mathematically speaking, w is some parameter which distinguishes concrete manifestations of the property in concern, disregarding its real meaning. In this paper, we will take w in a narrower (and more realistic) way: it is just a certain parameter characterizing a context (situation) in which the given linguistic expression is used.</p><p>As a special case, when dealing with evaluating expressions only then we may even specify context as follows: the type representing contexts is = o where is arbitrary type. Each context is in this case a function from the set of truth values to a set of objects of type . The reason for this definition is basically technical since it enables us to transfer properties to objects of various kinds without necessity to define them explicitly again and to specify once and again properties (such as ordering) that are defined already for truth values (for the details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). In the sequel, we will not provide a detailed interpretation of contexts. In the formal theory, they will be identified with certain chosen types, whatever kind they are.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">Local and general contexts</head><p>Let us now turn to definitions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">23</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. One may be surprised by the fact that they represent functions which assign some truth value to each couple of contexts w, w and to each couple of elements x, y. This seems to contradict the general definition of intension in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> where only one context (possible world) is considered. However, our definition means that each element x in the context w is in relation with some element y in the context w (in various degrees), i.e., these intensions represent a certain relation. Hence, couples of contexts in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">23</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_61">25</ref>) can be naturally explained. Namely, we can distinguish local and general contexts.</p><p>Local contexts are the parameters w. General contexts are couples or more generally, tuples of contexts w, w , . . . . Hence, we may read intensions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">23</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> as functions from general contexts into the set of fuzzy sets, in general on M × M (i.e., fuzzy relations). Consequently, we returned to the generally accepted understanding to the concept of intension.</p><p>Let us remark that this enables us to consider general contexts even as certain complex structures over the set of contexts W. However, we will not develop this idea in this paper.</p></div>

Besides others, the context was there identified with type o. This theory enables us to express in elegant form the meaning of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. For example, let us consider a rule IF X is roughly small THEN Y is very small, where X, Y are variables for elements of different kinds (recall that these may be some features such as temperature, speed, depth, etc.). We will in this section refer to specific formulas whose precise structure can be found see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Let a formula Sm ∈ Form (o )( o) be a formal interpretation of the intension of the evaluating predication "X is linguistic hedge small" and let ∈ Form oo interpret the hedge roughly and the hedge very. Finally, let w ∈ Form o , w ∈ Form o be formulas representing contexts and x ∈ Form , y ∈ Form represent elements. Then intension of the above rule can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">w w x y • Sm ( w x) ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ Sm ( w y), (<label>27</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_66">)</formula><p>where w x ≡ ( t o • x ≡ wt o ). It is noticeable on (27) that we have obtained a clear, unified and explicit interpretation of a very large class of fuzzy IF-THEN rules which consist of adjectives of the same kind (i.e., small, big, etc.) but refer to objects of different kinds; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> can be the intension of a conditional expression, for example IF temperature is roughly small THEN pressure is very small. This is in perfect accordance with the way how people understand such expressions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Systems of fuzzy IF-THEN rules</head><p>In this section, we will focus on systems of fuzzy IF-THEN rules; we will call them linguistic descriptions. The ground, of course, will be the interpretation of one rule developed above. As one can expect, the situation is more complicated because there raise more possibilities how to grasp this problem. One possibility is to take a linguistic description as a text consisting of separate rules. The general topic is the same but semantically, the linguistic description leads to a set of intensions rather than to one specific intension only. We will speak about explicit intension in this case. The second possibility is to seek a certain hidden intension of the whole linguistic description. This will be called implicit intension and we will show that this may not always exist. There is also a possibility to join rules forming the linguistic description by a connective ('and' or 'or') and take it as one (long) sentence that, of course, has its own intension. However, this intension may be different from the implicit intension. Conditions for existence of an implicit intension are studied. This question turns out to be related with the old problem of solving fuzzy relation equations studied in the fuzzy set literature (see the citations).</p></div>

In correspondence with the explanation above, (45) can be seen from two sides: first, each rule is a compound evaluating expression which has its own intension and thus, the linguistic description is a set of intensions providing us with some knowledge. We will speak about explicit knowledge coming out of the linguistic description, or simply, explicit knowledge from the linguistic description.</p><p>Second, the linguistic description as a whole represents a certain kind of a relation raising from the intensions of all the evaluating expressions occurring in (45).

Namely, intensions are not formulas of type o and so, they cannot be explicitly used in formal proofs. Is there some way how a specific knowledge contained in (48) can be grasped? The clue lays in two observations: For example, from the rule 'IF X is small THEN Y is big' we know that "if a value of X is small then there is a value of Y that is certainly big".</p><p>These observations can be formalized as follows.</p><p>Ad (52)</p><p>We conclude that the explicit knowledge means that the linguistic description provides lists of formulas (50) and (51), or (49) and (52) (depending on the form of fuzzy IF-THEN rules occurring in LD) that are of type o and that must be provable in T. Such a theory T will be called a theory determined by the linguistic description LD. Note also that we cannot take in fuzzy logic the considered list of formulas as conjunction of them because of existence of two different conjunction connectives (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>).</p><p>If one wishes, he/she may take (50) and (51), or (49) and (52) as axioms of T.

Therefore, we will not specify the theory T precisely and focus only on some properties which should be fulfilled by it.</p><p>Furthermore, the text is a set of sentences and so, we may distinguish its topic and focus (cf.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Outline of further development</head><p>It follows from the above analysis that fuzzy IF-THEN rules can be seen as linguistic (i.e., surface) representations of special formulas of fuzzy intensional logic. When taken in this way, they lead to formal theories with special properties. This opens a wide field for pure logical study. Various specific concepts may thus be introduced, for example as follows.</p><p>Let T be a consistent theory based on LD in the sense of Section 6.2. Let R 0 / ∈ LD be a new fuzzy IF-THEN rule. Then R 0 extends LD if T ∪ { w yB w y ≡ w yU A } is consistent where A , B interpret adjectival predications in the antecedent and succedent of R, respectively. A theory T is maximal if there is no fuzzy IF-THEN rule R which extends it. We may now study conditions under which this is possible.</p><p>We may also study ways of deriving conclusions from linguistic descriptions. A specific principle is perception-based logical deduction described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p><p>Interesting problem raises when realizing that we may consider also compound linguistic expressions of the form R := R I 1 and • • • and R I m , (59)</p><formula xml:id="formula_134">Ȓ := R A 1 or • • • or R A m . (<label>60</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_135">)</formula><p>We may find explicit intensions of these expressions in the way analogous to that described in Sections 5. However, intensions (61) or (62) need not be equivalent to the implicit intensions considered in Section 6.4 and further.</p><p>Conditions for existence of the latter, relation between explicit and implicit intensions, their deduction potential, and other questions should be studied. Is there a difference between (45), and (59) or (60) (alternatively, in terms of intensions, between (48) and (61) or (62))? The answer is yes: (45) is a text consisting of separate sentences while (59) or (60) are specific compound expressions whose parts (i.e., fuzzy IF-THEN rules) are set to be related to each other using a specific connective, namely 'and' or 'or'. Thus, the latter is a stronger proposition than the former. We see from Section 6 that (59) and (60) are linguistic characterizations of strongly extensional functions. Unfortunately, this is a rather big limitation and we will demonstrate elsewhere that the use of evaluating linguistic expressions is in most realistic situations excluded (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>).</p><p>Note that interpretation of (61) and ( <ref type="formula">62</ref>) are functions that assign to each couple of contexts w 0 , w 0 ∈ W one of the respective fuzzy relations (A j (w 0 , u) ⊗ B j (w 0 , v)), (64</p><formula xml:id="formula_136">)</formula><p>where A j (w 0 ) ⊂ ∼ M , B j (w 0 ) ⊂ ∼ M , j = 1, . . . , m and A j (w 0 , u), B j (w 0 , v) are the corresponding membership degrees for u, v ∈ M .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Disregarding natural language</head><p>Let us briefly discuss the relation between the interpretation of fuzzy IF-THEN rules as presented in the literature on fuzzy set theory (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>) and the theory developed in this paper.</p><p>The essential difference lays in taking fuzzy IF-THEN rules as a specific way for description of a function and ignoring their character as natural language expressions. Namely, the whole linguistic description is assigned one of two possible formulas of first-order fuzzy logic: DNF(x, y) = where DNF stands for disjunctive, and CNF for conjunctive normal form because due to Perfilieva <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, these forms are obtained as generalization of the corresponding classical concepts. There are no special requirements on the formulas A j (x), B j (y) from the point of view of linguistics. It should be noted that in practice, most frequent is (65).</p><p>Then the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_137">(∃x)(A (x) &amp; &amp; &amp; DNF(x, y)),</formula><p>corresponds to our implicit knowledge from linguistic description (cf. Section 6.4) and its interpretation is called Mamdani (or Mamdani-Assilian) rule of inference (the connective &amp; &amp; &amp; is often interpreted by minimum)-cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p><p>In the light of Section 5.15, (65) and (66) correspond to (62) and (61) when a couple of contexts w 0 , w 0 ∈ W is fixed with the interpretation being one of the respective fuzzy relations (64) and (63). It is significant, that another interpretation of (65) and ( <ref type="formula">66</ref>) is obtained when changing the model while in case of (62) and (61), another interpretation is obtained in the same model when changing the contexts w 0 , w 0 . Still more can be obtained when changing also the model. Moreover, FTT includes predicate fuzzy logic <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref> and so, everything proved in the latter can be proved also in FTT. Consequently, our theory of fuzzy IF-THEN rules is more general and comprehensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we made a step to the development of a concise formal theory of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. This theory should encompass the formal theories based on fuzzy predicated logics as well as theories focusing only on semantical models. The outcome of our approach is a high generality which enables us to cover not only technical side of the rules, but also to model their meaning when taken as special expressions of natural language. We are confident that eventually all relevant knowledge about fuzzy inference methods based on fuzzy IF-THEN rule bases will be represented, formalized and backed up by proof within the well-founded logical representation presented here. Thus, we get closer to the ability to equip robots with intelligence so that they could understand, at least, part of our language and process linguistic instructions in a way analogous to the way how people normally do it. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">8</ref></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( a )</head><label>a</label><figDesc>Fuzzy equivalence/fuzzy equality ≡:= x ( y E (o ) y )x .
