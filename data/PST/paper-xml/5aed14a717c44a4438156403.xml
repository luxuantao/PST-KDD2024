<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Intelligent transportation systems are designed to provide innovative applications and services relating to traffic management, as well as to facilitate the access to information for other systems and users. The compelling motivation for employing underutilized onboard resources for transportation systems and the advancements in management technology for Cloud computing resources has promoted the concept of Vehicular Clouds. This work gathers and describes the most recent approaches and solutions for Vehicular Clouds, featuring applications, services, and traffic models that can enable Vehicular Cloud in a more dynamic environment. We have considered a large number of applications and services that showed relevance in the scope of the transportation system, benefiting its management, drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Nevertheless, the high traffic mobility imposes as a significant challenge in implementing a Vehicular Cloud on continually changing physical resources. The dynamics of the environment bring fundamental issues and increase the complexity of building this new type of Cloud. By analyzing the existing traffic models, we found that Vehicular Cloud computing is technologically feasible not just in the static environment, like a parking lot or garage where vehicles are stationary, but also the dynamic scenarios, such as highways or streets where vehicles move.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The automotive industry has been showing revolutionary changes lately, investing in the incorporation of more technological features in vehicles, as well as allowing drivers to access sophisticated smart vehicles for daily use. Any typical current vehicle is considered a computer-on-wheels because it comes equipped 5 with a powerful onboard computer, large-capacity storage device, sensitive radio transceivers, collision radars, and a GPS device. At the same time, Cloud computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has presented fast-paced advancements that have allowed it to support built dynamic Clouds in mobile environments.</p><p>The flexibility that Cloud has introduced for the on-demand provision of re-10 sources and services over the Internet has allowed it to be recognized as a public utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For instance, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) has become the largest provider of dynamic compute capacity in the Cloud. This growth is justified by the increasing interest of businesses into elastically and scalably renting Cloud services, platforms, or software instead of building and 15 maintaining their data centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Consequently, these allied interests further advance the development of Cloud computing, which introduces a pay-as-you-go model, scalability, resources on demand, virtualization technology, and Quality of Service (QoS) as its key features. The accelerated interests in its versatility have made Cloud computing the major technological trend in IT, with mas-20 sive investments and corporate efforts to migrate their business into this new paradigm.</p><p>The benefits and challenges in the field have motivated several germinal works, promoting the introduction of a Vehicular Cloud framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This initial work abstracts the current issues and classifies the solutions as a matter 25 of leveraging on the underutilized vehicular resources, such as network connectivity, computational power, storage, and sensing capability, which can be</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>shared with vehicle owners. Furthermore, this framework is expected to enable business models to aggregate resources and rent them to potential consumers, similarly to the traditional Cloud infrastructure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> In this context, a vehicular Cloudlet has been presented, which consists of a group of vehicles that can share resources through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, or even vehicle-toeverything (V2X) communication. As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, a vehicular Cloudlet can be established in the road environment (mobile Cloudlet), which consists of 35 moving vehicles, or on a parking lot (static Cloudlet), which is relatively stationary and formed by parked vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Consequently, each kind of Cloudlet suits a range of different Vehicular Cloud services, which might be dependent on the degree of the mobility and dynamic alterations on the disposition of Cloud elements. As examples of suitability, the highway scenario introduces very high 40 mobility and promotes a mobile vehicular Cloudlet ideal for data dissemination services. On the other hand, vehicles waiting in still urban traffic might form a Vehicular Cloud that can well serve the execution of traffic management applications, which may identify solutions to alleviate traffic congestion. In an even more static situation, the Cloudlet composed of static parked vehicles proves to 45 be relatively stable environment for computing tasks and storing data, providing resources for traditional Cloud services.</p><p>Evolved from Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET), Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) has been receiving increasing attention. VCC is a very appealing technology due to its features and capabilities in supporting a series of novel, 50 relevant, or sensitive applications. Additionally, VCCs are designed to initiate objectives that directly match everyday transportation needs, such as enabling computational services at low cost to authorized users, reducing traffic congestion, and implementing services to improve road safety. This work is intended as a reference to provide an extensive study the most recent VCC works, aim-   applications of the Vehicular Cloud. Section 6 focuses on presenting the existing traffic models, which estimate the number of computing resources in the dynamic vehicular environment. Finally, Section 8 briefly summarizes the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">75</ref> and presents remarks for future research directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Vehicular Networks</head><p>On a daily basis, modern big cities face chronic transportation problems including slow traffic flow, traffic congestion, and emergencies caused by accidents.</p><p>An increase in the number of vehicles has caused a growth of complexity in al-  On the other hand, several recent technological advancements have empowered the implementation of various traffic management services and driving applications, such as accurate control of traffic flow, cooperative monitoring of traffic, and detection of traffic hazards. All services and applications depend on, or can benefit from, the concept of connected vehicles, which cooperatively 95 propagate and disseminate information. VANETs' design has been inspired by Mobile Ad-hoc Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; investments in this vehicular communication paradigm is a reflection of the constant growth in popularity with advancements in technologies, solutions, and support to a wide range of applications.</p><p>Vehicular Networks primarily incorporate Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-100 to-Infrastructure (V2I), as well as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>Several initiatives have dedicated significant efforts in to employ Vehicular Networks to tackle unfortunate and unpredictable traffic hazards and counter unpleasant driving events <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. These issues pertinent to transportation have 105 implications for solving problems in adequately disseminating and collecting real-time data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. Since these new networks have enabled a unique communication environment for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Vehicular Networks currently extend this context to primarily involve safety, privacy and security interests. • Vehicle-to-Everything. V2X comprises the transfer of data between a vehicle and any other element provided with networking capabilities, including any element involved in this communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. This vehicular communication method is general and includes other specific approaches, such 120 as V2I, V2V, Vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), Vehicle-to-device (V2D), and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G).</p><p>• Vehicle-to-Vehicle. V2V consists of communications among vehicles in adhoc mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. The communication is made possible through multi-hop transmissions of vehicles that are in range, and it supports the valuable 125 transmission of traffic-related messages, such as road status, driving conditions, and traffic accidents.</p><p>• Vehicle-to-Infrastructure. V2I represents the communications between vehicles and fixed network infrastructures for the exchange of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. These communications, in most cases, involve the access of 130 external networks, such as the Internet or any traditional Cloud service, through RSUs and gateways. The communication links provided in V2I introduce better security, but the bandwidth they demand is higher than for V2V links.</p><p>The spectra of the 5.9 GHz frequency band have been allocated for the 135 Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) protocol to foster the implementation and allow the operation of V2V communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>. Onboard units (OBU), roadside units (RSU), and certification authorities (CA) are the principal components that constitute the environment of Vehicular Networks, considered core parts of their architecture. • Road-side Unit. RSU is an essential communication component that allows communication with network infrastructure. This unit is in a fixed location and is in charge of collecting and disseminating data that might 150 be related to traffic status, such as accidents ahead, nearest parking spots, gas stations, and length of a traffic queue. To be capable of executing its functions, an RSU presents at least one networking interface that connects it to the Internet and to short-range wireless communication. In this way, the component works a gateway that allows vehicles to access network 155 infrastructure, enabling Internet connections and access to services. Also, an RSU can serve as a monitoring endpoint that collects information from roads and vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, so it is usually mounted along the road and intersections, assisting with traffic coordination.</p><p>• Certification Authority. CA is responsible for preventing security issues in 160 Vehicular Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. This component is aware of the nearby vehicles, and it provides entity validation and assessment on information sources when receiving messages. A CA is a fully trusted party in the environment and is crucial for Vehicular Networks. In the architecture, commonly trusted entities serve as CAs, such as the municipal transportation depart-165 ment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Comparison of Vehicular Networks and MANET</head><p>Vehicular Networks consist of an extension from MANETs, representing a subclass that focuses on the vehicular environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>. In the broad context of MANETs, RSUs and OBUs communicate in an ad-hoc domain where the RSUs • Every packet transmission in the ad-hoc network is limited by coverage distance. A wireless node can only transmit data to and through its neigh-175 boring nodes, which forward packets beyond its coverage. Consequently, nodes in MANETs mostly need ad-hoc routing protocols for communicating, such as on-demand routing, table-driven routing, and hybrid routing. However, MANET Routing protocols are not suitable for Vehicular Networks since they cannot cope with the fast-changing ad-hoc network 180 topology.</p><p>• The number of nodes composing a Vehicular Network is considerably larger than in MANET. Urban scenarios are composed of many vehicles, considering that every vehicle represents a single mobile node. Usually, as a matter of simplification, the Vehicular Network area is divided into smaller 185 regions, allowing the design of protocols, services, and applications that better suits the local singularities. Stationary RSUs, which serve as a communication gateways, interconnect these regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>• The topology of the Vehicular Networks is defined according to the layout of the road network and traffic conditions. In contrast to descriptions 190 from MANETs, vehicles do not move arbitrarily in a region; existing road segments and traffic regulations, such as stops, traffic lights, and road directions, delimit vehicle routes. This urban traffic topology increases the predictability of mobile nodes in Vehicular Networks when compared with the MANET nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>195</head><p>• Functional lifespan of MANET nodes is restrictive. Power consumption is a significant concern for the design of effective solutions. In most cases of applications and services, throughput is compromised due to the limitations of energy capacity, creating bottlenecks in the system and requiring communication alternatives. On the other hand, Vehicular Networks con-200 tain nodes known as OBUs that are not prone to power limitations, as well as storage, since vehicles include batteries that supply enough power to support all needed computational and communication tasks.</p><p>• OBU is capable of performing sophisticated and more complex computation tasks. Without power restrictions, an OBU can receive relatively 205 computation-intensive processes, introducing opportunities for implementing advanced services and applications.</p><p>• Vehicular Networks are mostly ephemeral <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. Nodes in Vehicular Networks present high mobility because vehicles move fast on roads; this creates a network topology that changes constantly, and connectivity might 210 benefit from the opportunism of peers and communication ranges <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Mobility is the most significant characteristic of Vehicular Networks and is its notable main difference against MANETs. Traffic of vehicles predominately dictates the distribution density of nodes. In this case, mobility analyses must account for behavioral factors; for instance, density  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Vehicular Network Applications</head><p>Massive interest and efforts to explore Vehicular Networks in traffic environments have generated numerous applications for a vast set of purposes. Such applications fit into three main classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>:</p><p>• Applications for road safety. The context of these applications focuses on 225 making use of the communication capabilities that Vehicular Networking introduces as an enabler to provide critical messages. These messages can support hazard notifications, collision avoidance, and warnings, which can provide information about harsh weather conditions for the sake of road safety and traffic accident reduction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>230</head><p>• Applications for traffic efficiency. The design of these applications aims to aid drivers and the transportation management system. They provide means for better working with the road, assisting decision-making during driving, and complementing decision processes with additional information. For instance, applications can assist in warning about the possibility 235 of traffic jams, detecting vehicles that are queuing up, or overtaking other vehicles.</p><p>• Applications for passenger comfort. These value-added applications prioritize the comfort of driver and passengers. They are designed to make vehicular trips more pleasant by providing onboard services, such as In-240 ternet access, messaging, and infotainment.</p></div>

Cloud Computing presented a paradigm shift in the global</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T information technology (IT) industry. Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, CC is defined as a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services, which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. CC has introduced several 250 novel characteristics for distributed computing solutions when compared to traditional local systems:</p><p>• CC presents on-demand provisioning of computational resources, storage, and IT services. It has infinite computing resources available to users; consequently, users are not necessarily required to plan for the supply of 255 physical resources;</p><p>• Users have the opportunity to rent services and resources according to their requirements at a given moment. CC can offer flexible alternatives for users to "purchase" extra hardware resources only when there is an increase in their needs. This feature is helpful for small-to medium-260 size businesses in which significant financial commitments can be avoided, skipping the building of an IT infrastructure.</p><p>• CC further provides users with the capability to rent computational resources for a required period. As a result, users have the benefit of leasing resources based on the length of a project, and these same resources can 265 be released after the project ends. This temporary lease facilitates budget management in which the progress of a project does not demand the purchase of physical servers.</p><p>With all the advantages that introduce flexibility for the management of resources on project changing requirements, users and enterprises have shown an 270 increasing migration of their IT services and data to CC servers. An excellent example of this trend is Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2), which corresponds to one the largest Cloud service platforms and providers with millions of globally spread users.  To reach for efficiency, a component known as Cloud Watch monitors the utilization of resources, and it reports results to the Auto Scaling system. This system 280 is responsible for decision-making in scaling services, according to the needs of users. Cloud services have reached a certain level of maturity and are offered in three major classes, namely Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">PaaS: Platform as a Service</head><p>PaaS offers the means for users to develop, run, and manage applications, providing a platform where users do not need to be concerned about the lower-300 level details of the environment. Consequently, the services in this category allow users to configure settings and control the deployment of software.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">SaaS: Software as a Service</head><p>A Cloud service provider in the context of SaaS model offers access to a suite of software that resides in its datacenter <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. The provider is responsible for maintaining software, licensing applications, and making software available to 310 customers as a service on demand. Usually, the suite consists of office and messaging, Data Management System (DBMS), computer-aided design, customer relationship management (CRM), and antivirus. Working as a subscriptionbased service, SaaS facilitates the rental of software for a period, as an alternative to its purchase. Since the whole suite of software is made available by the 315 same service provider, this class of services makes it possible to avoid incompatibility issues between software, which users typically experience; consequently, concerns of matching the operating system of users with software are nonexistent due to the entire service being available through Web browsers. The IBM SmartCloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> platform is a significant example of the SaaS model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Mobile Cloud Computing</head><p>Mobile devices have grown in quantity, capabilities, accessibility, and popularity; this growth has enabled the delivery of high services and applications through them, which has promoted a new research area named Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. The designs in this new field devise mobile devices 325 as input and output endpoints and assume that remote Cloud servers process intensive computation tasks.</p><p>The MCC forum <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> defines MCC, in its simplest terms, as an infrastructure in which mobile devices do not process data or store data within them; these tasks are performed remotely by other entities. Therefore, Mobile Cloud 330 applications transfer the stress on data storage and burden on computing power from mobile devices to the Cloud. This feature allows applications and mobile computing to be available not only to smartphone users, but also to a broad range of mobile service users.</p><p>MCC is expected to offer significant potential for IT applications and presents 335 unique characteristics, such as mobility, portability, and communication. Several features are unique in MCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>:</p><p>• Extension of battery lifetime. Even with several technological advancements, battery lifetime still consists of significant concerns for mobile devices. Limited, insufficient battery life conditions users to charge their 340 devices with a high frequency and restricts the use of light-weight applications. This reduced autonomy represents an adverse characteristic of these electronic devices. Several methods have been proposed that counter this negative aspect and reduce power consumption through efficient CPU performance and smart screen and disk management. This limitation in-345 volves modifications in the structure and architecture of smart devices, which might not be even feasible. Also, rich services and applications still implicate on execution constraints in the devices, including products that have already been in use, although such techniques are capable of increasing battery lifetime. In this particular case, MCC substantially serves</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>to offload the processing load and storage burden from mobile devices, migrating computation-intensive tasks that involve complex processing to remote Cloud servers. Concerns regarding battery lifetime have motivated the design of several offloading strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref> mapped in intricate simulation scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>355</head><p>• Improvement of processing capability and storage capacity. MCC is intended to increase the execution performance of applications and services and extend storage capacity. Through better performance, MCC contributes to a decrease in execution time and energy consumption. Even though the processing capabilities of devices have advanced significantly, 360 they still present limited physical resources and are not suitable for hosting rich, complex applications. With offloading models, MCC can support the execution of such applications as offloading strategies can migrate partitioned tasks and seamlessly store large data in the Cloud through wireless networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>365</head><p>• Enhancement of reliability. Mobile devices have a considerable benefit on improving reliability through MCC. Because of the partial or complete remote execution of applications and services, data and results are stored and replicated on remote Cloud servers. Offloading tasks considerably lowers the risk of data loss; compared to mobile devices, servers are more 370 stable and resilient to failures. In addition to the increased security that may result from the use of the Cloud, several levels of data security models in MCC introduce more robust data protection for users and service providers. For instance, Cloud-based mobile digital rights management (DRM) strategies help to preserve the integrity of massive unstructured 375 digital content, such as video and audio, from being inappropriately accessed and distributed in an unauthorized manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Due to its direct evolution from Cloud Computing and mobile computing, MCC have inherited several advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>• Dynamic Provisioning. MCC establishes resource provisioning to users 380 under authorized access and on-demand fine-grained, self-service grounds.</p><p>This feature facilitates the supply of resources and services without prior planning, flexibly promoting allocation according to the current needs of consumers. The apriori planning consequently allows service providers to implement applications in a constrained amount of resources, which 385 increases as the system scales up to accommodate the growth of applications.</p><p>• Ease of Access. The online interface in MCC boosts accessibility considerably; users reach out for resources at any time and to depend on Internet access through wireless networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>390</head><p>• Ease of Integration. Service providers are capable of distributing resources and sharing costs. This feature enables vast support to a myriad of applications in their context, meeting compatibility requirements.</p><p>The offloading of tasks and storage from mobile devices must not necessarily be conducted to Cloud servers. In the context of Mobile Edge Computing 395 (MEC), the resources positioned at the edge of the mobile network shorten the communication path and distance between mobile devices and the Cloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</p><p>This strategy allows for greater accessibility of highly demanded services and applications in mobile devices, considering the restrictive time constraints and delay requirements. Consequently, MEC allows users to avoid the excessive ex-400 tra load imposed on both radio and backhaul of mobile networks, decreasing communication latency considerably through caching strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. From an architectural perspective, MCC presents an entirely centralized resource utilization approach while MEC enables a fully distributed access to resources in many locations. A three-tier architecture defines the general structure of MEC, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>In more volatile and flexible scenarios where the connectivity of mobile devices do not allow continuous access to any communication infrastructure, Mo-410 bile Ad-Hoc Cloud raises as a potential solution for MCC offloading. Mobile Ad-Hoc Cloud (MAC) consists of a more particular context of MCC, where a device utilizes the available resources of neighboring mobile devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. In this approach, the capabilities of a device are extended, but only through access to closer resources, avoiding delays. MAC allows a solution that does not 415 depend on full connectivity with the infrastructure to promote MCC benefits.</p><p>However, the rapidly changing mobile environment creates a lack of connectivity and justifies MAC, while also imposing several challenges in establishing a Cloud of mobile devices. As derived from MCC, these difficulties involve task offloading and scheduling, resource allocation and management, discovery, and 420 formation of the MAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. The limitation of MAC is that it requires the collaboration of nearby mobile devices to share their resources, needing incentives to motivate participation. Another crucial constraint in the MAC model consists of costly decision-making in task allocation, as well as Cloud formation and maintenance, against the benefits of offloading computing and storage to other 425 capability-impaired devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Vehicular Cloud Computing</head><p>The automotive industry has been building considerably intelligent vehicles, which already contain robust computing, communication, storage, and energy resources. These features differentiate modern vehicles from mobile devices, vehicles as for a targeted task, application, or service. However, VCC involves a very particular set of characteristics that set it aside from MAC. VCC deals with the extreme volatility of the environment and resources, the distinct movement 440 of vehicles, demand of applications, and sporadic availability, as well as the business model it encompasses, which allows resources to be harvested from vehicles to other elements, such as mobile devices.</p><p>Recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref> have coined the term, adequately defined the concept of, and delimited the first designs of Vehicular Cloud Computing. These 445 works presented VCC with the principal goal that consists of gathering, allocating, and utilizing available resources on board of vehicles. These resources comprehend capabilities ranging from processing, communication, storage, and sensor, which may be dynamically harvested in groups of vehicles under the authorization and agreement of owners and drivers. The Cloud, drivers, pas-450 sengers, and users benefit from efficiently aggregating all surrounding resources and making them effectively available as Cloud services to the public. Such VCC services are convoluted and relevant, complementing regular Cloud Computing services. As defined in its first scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, VCC concerns a a group of vehicles which are broadly autonomous and contain computing, communication, 455 sensing, and physical resources that might be coordinated and allocated dynamically assigned to authorized users. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> introduces a brief comparison of the major characteristics of CC, MCC, and VCC.</p><p>Regarding computation capability and storage capacity, it is noticeable that the conventional Cloud servers present the most powerful local computing re-460 sources, and a modern vehicle typically includes an onboard computer, which has much greater computing capabilities than that in a mobile device. Besides, mobility is a valuable and an inherent part of the physical resources of MCC and VCC while the resources of a traditional CC are commonly located in the fixed data center. CC is also not restricted by energy consumption due to the con-465 stant power supply in the data center; similarly, VCC is not constrained by the power since a vehicle contains a large-capacity battery, and the running engine continually recharges it. However, the battery life of mobile devices confines  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, recognize this approach as a paradigm shift in transportation systems. Vehicles' mobility and the scale of the environment require sophisticated resource management strategies to coordinate resources efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>Both paradigms are essential elements for the design of solutions in Intel-485 ligent Transportation Systems, including the support to an extensive range of applications and services, such as the estimation and prediction of traffic con-</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>ditions in a simulation environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>. However, due to the high mobility of the elements that compose a VCC, the challenges that it endures with the dynamic interconnection of vehicles are very similar to the issues experienced 490 in Vehicular Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. Even though extensive efforts have been applied to find solutions that tackle the highly dynamic changes of communication topology in Vehicular Networks, the challenges persist and are actively present in VCC, which relies entirely on communication connections among vehicles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Taxonomy of Works on Vehicular Cloud Computing</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>495</head><p>Upon a comprehensive overview of the most relevant works related to VCC, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">5</ref> summarizes the approaches in the general taxonomy of Vehicular Cloud</p><p>Computing derived from previous efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>. Approaches covered in this survey focus on applications and services for different categories of vehicular Cloudlets.</p><p>Due to the practical interests in the already-existing transportation infras-500 tructure and Cloud services, VCC introduced opportunities for a vast number of potential applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. Among these applications, a proposal to compose and build a data center in parking lots was notable because of its low level of complexity and implementation convenience. The applicability of this approach resides on the existence of a large number of vehicles in garages of companies or 505 parking lots of shopping malls that rest still for a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>Together with this condition, the onboard storage of these vehicles is aggregated as a fundamental element in assembling a data center.</p><p>Applications involved with the dynamic traffic management system consist of another type of VCC application <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which directly deals with common transit Applications nevertheless require a set of innovative VCC services so that they can be built and transparently or seamlessly integrated into the current urban system. These novel services, such as NaaS, STaaS, CompaaS, and CaaS, consequently demand an infrastructure and models so that they can be openly 525 available for public access <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref>.</p><p>The mobility of the environment allows VCC to be classified into two major groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref>. One group represents a static Vehicular Cloudlet, assembled through the aggregation of resources of vehicles that show no movement; these</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>vehicles are still and resting in a parking lot, for example. In this particular 530 case, the VCC resembles a traditional Cloud because vehicles show a long-stay behavior. The other VCC group contains dynamic Vehicular Cloudlets, so it deals with and relies on highly dynamic traffic flow. Applications that depend on rapid dynamic changes of the urban environment can profit from these dynamic Cloudlets; as previously mentioned, these applications may assist the 535 transportation system with traffic-related issues or emergency situations.</p><p>For instance, the work presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref> devises a static Vehicular Cloud as a germinal work towards the implementation of a VC. The work densely investigated the expected number of vehicles in a long-term parking lot at an international airport. By using a stochastic process, the system could be modeled On the other hand, works with dynamic Vehicular Clouds deal with rather more intricate and unstable environments. The works described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">59]</ref> observed and modeled the average quantity of computing resources embedded within vehicles in a road segment. The work represented the free-flow of vehicles, as well as traffic jams, through stochastic traffic models. that allows effective migration of tasks in and from parked vehicles, redistributing tasks when vehicles leave or arrive in the parking lot <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68]</ref>. In this case, the model needs to consider the migration burden, which involves suspending tasks, saving their execution status, identifying new hosts, and transferring jobs; all these factors are vital in determining the feasibility of task offloading in such 635 dynamic scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref>.</p></div>

On the other hand, connected forwarding comprehends the data transfer through 650 multi-hop paths established among vehicles. Carry-and-forward is comprised of vehicles storing data until it can be forwarded to the destination when the path between the AP and the downloader shows intermittent connections.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>resources of parked vehicles. This work assumes that vehicles are connected to 660 power sources so that there is no restriction in power consumption and battery autonomy. The work also considers a business model for encouraging air travelers to contribute through benefits on free parking or automotive services; in this case, this approach assumes that vehicle owners are motivated to share unused resources for building up the Cloud.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>665</head><p>In this same sense, another work focused on designing a two-tier architecture for a vehicular data center <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[70]</ref>. The devised architecture centers on allowing the proper control of excessive storage in a parking lot. The proposed approach concerns the constant incoming and outgoing vehicular resources, which follows the model of a random variable; this design differs from the traditional data  ing without the need of computing resources from servers. This self-sufficiency aspect exploits the availability of onboard physical resources, such as computing power, storage, sensing devices, GPS, GIS, collision radars, cameras, and transceivers. This list of physical resources just tends to grow as the automotive 700 industry increasingly invests in smart and intelligent devices embedded in vehicles. These advancements enable novel applications that complement or expand the features of Vehicular Clouds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Another similar traffic management application consists of the Intellectual</head><p>Road Infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref>, which also collected and aggregated data in real-time to readily determine traffic conditions. Therefore, this work proposed a road 780 infrastructure to monitor and control traffic in a real-time manner. This realtime coordination is envisioned to minimize overall transportation costs and improve safety. The proposed system accesses devices and vehicles supplied with onboard radio frequency identification (RFID), GPS, and sensors to gather information about traffic conditions. After data aggregation finishes, the system 785 processes the information in the Cloud and presents valuable results via an online service.</p><p>The third traffic management application differed from the previous two applications because it focused on a particular context, which involved identifying parking spots in real-time. This recommendation system, Context-Aware Dy-790 namic Parking Service <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[79]</ref>, extended the traditional parking services in garages by dynamically updating the available parking spots for incoming vehicles.

With much less restrictive assumptions, these models allow a substantial number of parameters to be considered. The parameters, to some degree, can simulate real finite aspects, such as weather situation, the reac-950 tion time of drivers, road conditions, and vehicles' technical specifications. All these details result in a significant degree of accuracy at the cost of complexity.</p><p>The speed of vehicles consists of an essential element in these models, being a determining factor in the four modes of vehicle movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[91]</ref>:</p><p>• Free-driving mode is most suitable for free-flows of vehicles. Vehicles are 955 sparsely distributed in road segments and do not encounter obstacles in their paths.

However, they are highly computation-intensive, especially in scenarios where urban areas may contain a large number of vehicles. Moreover, the analytical car-following framework imposed high complexity for obtaining closed-form results. This simplified approach shows that these models contain a smaller number of variables, which makes traffic streams less complex, facilitating their implementation. This lower complexity causes stream models to be more popular than 985 microscopic models for the design of data communication strategies in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks. Nevertheless, the macroscopic traffic models used in open research works contain assumptions that are not consistent, concerning case-specific aspects. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> lists the main notation elements employed in the traffic stream models described in this section.   In work described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[94]</ref>, a model was proposed using principal curves (PC) 1000 as a paradigm extension from PCA to accommodate the variations in the input data curves. An algorithm is used to adjust the curves following an initialization that leads to an iterative execution that defines projections, expectations (recalculations), and a stop condition. The model is mainly driven by the arc-length of the curve towards the traffic stream data, as represented in Formula 6, while 1005 the model applies the PC smoothing on the curve when f (ψ) is consistent, as described in Formula 7.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">l = ψn ψ1 ||f (z)|| = n i=1 ||f (ψ i+1 ) -f (ψ i )||<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">f (ψ) = E(X|ψ f (X) = ψ), ∀ψ ∈ R 1<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The work described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[93]</ref> explored the inter-arrival times of vehicles in a road segment to define the general distribution of traffic and define a freeflow model.

The latter case establishes a dynamic, intricate scenario where the reachability of vehicles rapidly changes. Consequently, defining models that A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T can represent the behavior of vehicles is crucial for generating estimations and supporting the management of resources within the VCC. A model consists of a simple representation of reality; it enables simulations, 900 considering a finite number of assumed factors. Through the use of simplification and relevant suppositions, a model is capable of representing real scenarios, which contain a countless number of elements. The context of traffic flows includes many factors that influence traffic load, such as road geometry, traffic signs, road conditions, weather, and driver behavior. Besides that, a precise 905 mathematical model of the traffic is highly complex, as well as unfeasible, due to plenty of random events that occur. Therefore, traffic flow models also need assumptions. Several works have incorporated traffic models for supporting solutions of Vehicular Networks and Clouds. These models represent realistic traffic behavior in highways and urban 910 centers, serving as a mechanism for analyzing the performance of novel approaches, such as data dissemination schemes, routing protocols, and prediction of available onboard resources. Three distinct categories classify such models, providing different levels of abstraction and detail in their representation. 6.1. Car-Following Models 915 Car-following models comprehend the class of microscopic models [86]. Consequently, they individually characterize the behavior of every vehicle in the traffic flow. Several models have been proposed to represent the driving behavior in a road segment. Such models introduce a more adaptive approach to the behavior modeling of vehicles instead of optimization perspectives on the traffic 920 flow, in general. Table</figDesc></figure>

Since vehicles can serve as in-loco Cloud resources, they can support services and applications as Cloudlets, which then implement a three-tier structure in the context of offloading tasks in an MCC approach 1155 where there are mobile devices, Cloudlets, and the Cloud. However, the statusA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P Tof vehicles, which can be parked or moving, conditions Cloudlets as either static or dynamic. In addition, VCC may closely resemble a MAC when it is dynamically formed through the ad-hoc connections of the vehicles on a road segment for enabling more computation power to conduct tasks. However, the charac-1160 teristics of the environment and the vehicles condition the resource provision model and offloading strategies, which allows more opportunities for harvesting resources at the cost of dealing with higher mobility of computing nodes.The VCC services described in this study extend from the traditional Cloud services, exploring the needs of applications existing in the context of intelligent 1165 transportation systems. Computation as a Service enables vehicles struggling to run complex applications to extend their computation capabilities by offloading their load to nearby vehicles. In addition to vehicles, mobile devices and the Cloud can take advantage of harvesting resources. Network as a Service works to extend the communication capabilities of vehicles by bridging the communi-1170 cation to the Internet through the virtualization of the network and access to the interface that enables connectivity. The management of virtualized communication resources in VCC can hypothetically simplify the connectivity of vehicles, implementing pay-as-you-go service provisioning models. Building large-scale data centers from available onboard vehicle storage enables Storage as a Ser-1175 vice. The use of VCC storage shares the same benefits as Cloudlets in the MCC paradigm, which permits a reduction of communication delays and bandwidth consumption for the transfer of data over the Internet. Cooperation as a Service enables vehicles to collaborate among themselves for supporting complex applications or implementing inherently distributed tasks, such as coordinated 1180 data collection over the urban environment for tracking traffic load. From the potential VCC services, several applications have been devised and implemented, covering diversified purposes, such as building data centers, enabling traffic management, supporting an Internet of Vehicles, conducting urban surveillance, allowing more efficient infotainment, and promoting health 1185 care services.

Finally, VCC is the only type of Cloud that builds on highly dynamic physical resources, and it can be formed autonomously, depending on the traffic 470 situation.</p>Modern vehicles contain computational capabilities that are relatively robust for allowing access to demanding rich services and applications. Cloud Computing is capable of expanding such capabilities through the provisioning of limitless resources, thus enhancing access to services. Furthermore, vehicles' built-in re-475 sources tend to be underutilized for long periods of time, such as when vehicles are parked or motionless in traffic jams. Such situations enable promising opportunities for exploring underused computing resources to assemble Clouds autonomously. By the concept of connected vehicles, surrounding elements can participate in a VCC, comprising a critical strategy that contributes to tackling 480 complex issues in real-time and in loco; many works, such as in</p></note></figure>
