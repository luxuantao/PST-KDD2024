<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The mimetic finite difference (MFD) method mimics fundamental properties of mathematical and physical systems including conservation laws, symmetry and positivity of solutions, duality and self-adjointness of differential operators, and exact mathematical identities of the vector and tensor calculus. This article is the first comprehensive review of the 50-year long history of the mimetic methodology and describes in a systematic way the major mimetic ideas and their relevance to academic and real-life problems. The supporting applications include diffusion, electromagnetics, fluid flow, and Lagrangian hydrodynamics problems. The article provides enough details to build various discrete operators on unstructured polygonal and polyhedral meshes and summarizes the major convergence results for the mimetic approximations. Most of these theoretical results, which are presented here as lemmas, propositions and theorems, are either original or an extension of existing results to a more general formulation using polyhedral meshes. Finally, flexibility and extensibility of the mimetic methodology are shown by deriving higher-order approximations, enforcing discrete maximum principles for diffusion problems, and ensuring the numerical stability for saddle-point systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction 1.Design principles</head><p>Solving new and challenging problems with strong nonlinearities, discontinuities, and complex physical processes require advances in the quality, accuracy and robustness of numerical algorithms. In fact, the predictions and insights gained from simulations are no better than the physical models or mathematical methods used to solve them, and the numerical approximation is often a determining factor for the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of the simulations. Experience has confirmed that the best results are usually obtained when the discrete model preserves or mimics the underlying mathematical properties of the physical system. The objective of the mimetic finite difference (MFD) method is to create discrete approximations that preserve important properties of continuum equations on general polygonal and polyhedral meshes.</p><p>Many algorithms used for a numerical simulation of physical problems solve discrete approximations of partial differential equations (PDEs). Such PDEs are derived in the framework of a differential calculus and can be formulated in terms of first-order differential operators that are coordinate invariant such as the gradient of a scalar or a vector, the divergence of a vector or a tensor, and the curl of a vector. These PDEs express fundamental physical laws such as the conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy in fluid flows, or Faraday's, Maxwell-Ampere's, and Gauss' laws in electromagnetism. Many of the important properties of these PDEs are better understood when the equations are reformulated by using first-order differential operators. For example, the energy conservation in the gas dynamics and the coercivity of the diffusion operator follow immediately from the duality property of the divergence and gradient operators. To mimic these properties in a discrete setting, a careful design of numerical methods is required. The MFD method is one of the successful examples of a compatible discretization technology.</p><p>The construction of a mimetic discretization starts with the choice of a discrete representation of scalar, vector and tensor fields on a computational mesh through suitable degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom, whose choice is obviously problem dependent, can be associated with various mesh objects, e.g., vertices, edges, faces and cells. A collection of the degrees of freedom associated with similar mesh objects is called a grid function; hence, we have nodal grid functions, edge grid functions, etc. The linear combinations of the grid functions of the same type (with the straightforward definition of addition and multiplication by a real number) form a linear space. It is worth mentioning that this correspondence between the grid functions and the geometric objects forming the mesh has a very profound nature that may be well understood using concepts of algebraic topology, see the next subsection.</p><p>Next, we design the discrete operators that correspond to the first-order operators grad, curl, div and act on the grid functions. To such purpose, we first identify the connections between the most significant analytic properties of a mathematical model and the first-order differential operators in terms of which this model is formulated. The analytic property is often an integral identity, which, in most cases, expresses a duality relationship between the first-order operators. Then, we choose a discrete form for some first-order operators, which are dubbed as the primary operators (e.g., GRAD, CURL and DIV), and construct the other operators, which are dubbed as the derived operators (e.g., GRAD, CURL and DIV), from discrete analogs of the analytic properties: GRAD = -DIV * , CURL = CURL * , DIV = -GRAD * .</p><p>The constructive use of discrete duality relations is one of the major design principles of the mimetic discretizations and leads to the development of a discrete vector and tensor calculus (DVTC). The DVTC deals with grid functions and primary and derived operators. Note that the DVTC mimics only a subset of the analytic properties; therefore, it is not unique.</p><p>Let us illustrate the design concepts with a few examples. Regarding the degrees of freedom, we emphasize that their choice is problem dependent. In electromagnetics, it is natural to choose the normal component of the magnetic flux density B to the mesh faces and the tangential component of the electric intensity field E along the mesh edges as a discrete representation of such fields. Indeed, these components of B and E are continuous at interfaces between different materials. In Lagrangian hydrodynamics, it is natural to choose the Cartesian components of the velocity u at the mesh nodes as a discrete representation of u. Indeed, in the Lagrangian framework, the mesh nodes move with the fluid.</p><p>One of the most important analytic properties of many continuum equations is the conservation of the total energy. In fluid dynamics this property follows from the fact that the grad operator is the negative adjoint to the div operator. In electromagnetics, it follows from the selfadjointness of the curl operator. In the MFD method, this duality of the differential operators is transformed to the duality of the discrete operators. Another important analytic property is the geometric conservation law in fluid and solid dynamics. The mimetic framework ensures that the discrete divergence of the velocity is consistent with the change of volume of a fluid parcel. Often, it is not possible to formulate a set of primary and derived operators that mimic all the desired analytic properties. For example, in Lagrangian hydrodynamics, it is not possible to construct a discretization that simultaneously preserves energy and entropy in smooth isentropic flows.</p><p>In addition to the conservation laws, there are other important analytic properties of the differential operators that should be preserved or mimicked in numerical schemes. One of them is the characterization of the null space (or kernel) of a differential operator. Three popular examples include the exact identities: (a) div u = 0 if and only if u = curl v; (b) curl u = 0 if and only if u = grad p; and (c) grad p = 0 if and only if p is a constant. When designing primary and derived operators, we pay great attention to their null spaces, e.g.</p><p>DIV CURL = 0, DIV CURL = 0.</p><p>If a discrete operator has a different characterization of its null space, nonphysical parasitic modes may pollute the numerical solution. If the null space is too large, magnetic monopoles may appear in the electromagnetics. In the Lagrangian gas dynamics, a hourglass mesh motions may be induced. This latter phenomenon, which is responsible for numerical instabilities, is also well-known in the finite element community and is related to the under-integration effect; hourglass patterns can be also found in finite difference and finite volume calculations. On the other hand, if the null space is too small, the numerical approximation becomes stiff, a problem analogous to the well-known phenomenon of locking in the finite elements.</p><p>The finite size of the mesh cells leads to another important consideration. While the PDEs can resolve all the scales of the fluid motion, its numerical simulation may be more restricted. For example, in flows with high Reynolds numbers, the energy dissipation due to the molecular viscosity cannot be resolved. Since these effects of the physical viscosity are not taken into account, we need an artificial mechanism to dissipate the correct amount of energy. In compressible flows with shocks this mechanism is called the artificial viscosity. In fluids and gases, the forces due to the physical viscosity are isotropic. However, to effectively regularize a shock so that the flow does not depend on the computational mesh, the artificial viscous force needs to have the form of a (occasionally nonsymmetric) second-order tensor. This is one of the reasons why we need to consider tensor quantities in the mimetic discretizations for hydrodynamics.</p><p>Another analytic property, important for verification of physical simulations, is the symmetry of physical flows. In the inertial confinement fusion program, the uncertainty of whether a nonsymmetric result is due to numerical errors or the physical design limit severely our predictive capability and ultimately our understanding of the dynamical behavior of an implosion. Here, a major numerical issue is that small violation of the spherical symmetry due to a discretization error can be amplified by the physics nonlinearity and produce unacceptably large asymmetries in systems undergoing strong convergence. It turns out that numerical methods that preserve symmetries are viable for studying small perturbations of these symmetries. However, the development of such methods may require meshes with curvilinear edges (as opposed to straight line segments) and the derivation of suitable discrete operators.</p><p>There are many other issues to consider that are related to the design of discrete mimetic operators. For example, a continuum diffusion operator is symmetric and coercive. The discrete analog of this property is that the discrete diffusion operator is a symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrix. Such kind of matrices has important practical advantages: SPD matrices are non-singular, thus providing well-posedness of the discrete problem, and the corresponding linear system can be solved using efficient methods varying from a direct solver based on the Choleski factorization to the conjugate gradient method with a multigrid preconditioner. In the mimetic discretization, the discrete gradient and divergence operators are negative adjoint to each other. This condition is sufficient to obtain a discrete problem with an SPD matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">A fifty-year long successful story</head><p>We would like to use the opportunity provided by this special issue of Journal of Computational Physics to present a brief history of the MFD method. This opportunity is especially important because the early history of this method is closely related to the work that was carried out in the Soviet Union and that is not well known in the West. The references that we consider herein are representative and by no means these historical notes pretend to be complete and objective. It is more fair to say that these notes represent the history of how the Authors became aware of mimetic/compatible discretizations and of Author's personal involvement in their development.</p><p>The development of mimetic discretizations can be divided approximately into four periods.</p><p>The first period begins in the mid-fifties. The main characteristics of the first period are:</p><p>(i) the development of the first numerical models based on discrete operators that preserve important properties of the corresponding differential operators;</p><p>(ii) the use of orthogonal meshes, where the construction of such discrete operators is relatively simple;</p><p>(iii) the use of a compatibility property of such operators to prove stability and convergence of numerical methods.</p><p>We emphasize that the common strategy adopted in this period is to build the discrete analogs of the differential operators independently, and only then to prove that they satisfy an integral identity or a duality relation. To the best of our knowledge, the seminal paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">[259]</ref> is one of the earliest work based on the concept of discrete analogs of differential operators, that satisfy discrete analogs of integral relations on orthogonal meshes. These discrete operators are suitable to derive finite difference schemes and their mimetic properties can be used to prove the stability and convergence of such schemes. The most comprehensive presentation of this theory is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[230,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">231,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">234,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">235]</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[232]</ref>, the English translation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[231]</ref>.</p><p>Importance and effectiveness of compatible discretizations of differential operators have been recognized and clearly articulated in the series of papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[178]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[179]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[180]</ref>. There, the author introduces difference analogs of the basic operators grad, curl, and div on uniform orthogonal meshes and proves discrete versions of some fundamental relations of calculus, including the orthogonal decomposition theorem. Due to the simplicity of the orthogonal meshes, the discrete operators are defined through finite difference approximations of the first derivatives. For the Laplace equation and elliptic equations with discontinuous coefficients, the author proves stability and convergence of the finite difference discretizations based on the derived discrete operators. Similar ideas are also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[172]</ref> to build a discrete model for the Navier-Stokes equations in a stream function formulation. This discrete model satisfies a law of energy dissipation similar to the one in the continuum case.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[173]</ref> we find a different approach based on algebraic topology. The differential equations are represented using exterior differential forms and discrete analogs of the exterior derivative and the Hodge * operator are constructed. This approach is applied to the Laplace equation, the biharmonic equation, the Lame's equations for isotropic linear elasticity, and the steady Maxwell's equations. More details for Lame's equations are also given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[166]</ref>.</p><p>In a distinct series of paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[92]</ref>, which are also based on the algebraic topology, discrete models of PDEs are developed on orthogonal meshes. In this work, the square mesh on a plane is interpreted as a topological complex. The coboundary and boundary operators acting on functions of the complex and defined by the combinatorial structure, generate the difference analogs of the classical differential operators of mathematical physics, such as grad, curl, div, and Laplacian. Furthermore, a discrete model for the steady Euler equations is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[90]</ref>. In view of the quasi-linearity of these equations, it becomes necessary to introduce a suitable product between discrete differential forms; to this purpose, the Whitney product <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">[273]</ref> is chosen. Detailed description of this approach to the construction of discrete models is in the book of Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[93]</ref>.</p><p>In this same period, we find a few important papers in the West that introduce elements of the mimetic methodology. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[263]</ref>, strong relationships between some quantities of physical theories and basic geometric and chronometric objects are investigated. This study leads to a classification of physical theories, where the equations of physics can be described by a single mathematical operator, the coboundary operator, which is the exterior derivative on co-chains. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[95]</ref>, a finite difference method on simplicial meshes based on Whitney forms and a discrete Hodge theory is developed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[275]</ref> a numerical scheme is proposed for solving time-dependent Maxwell's equations on rectangular meshes using edge unknowns as degrees of freedom for the electric field and face unknowns for the magnetic field. This work is the foundation of an entire class of methods for computational electromagnetics, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[255]</ref>, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b226">228]</ref> mimetic methods for shallow water equations and climate modeling that preserve mass, potential enstrophy and vorticity on logically rectangular meshes are proposed. Mimetic methods with similar properties on triangular meshes are also found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[222]</ref> and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[123]</ref> a finite difference scheme is proposed for second-order elliptic Dirichlet boundary value problems on irregular networks with the topological structure of a logically rectangular mesh. This scheme uses a discrete divergence and a discrete gradient that can be shown to be in a duality relation. The optimal rate of convergence in a discrete energylike norm is proved. We also mention the numerical approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">[225]</ref>, which preserves mass, potential enstrophy and energy preserved on hexagonal geodesic meshes, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, which proposes a mimetic finite difference discretization for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</p><p>It turns out that these properties are fundamental requirements for a long-term numerical integration of the equations of incompressible fluid motion.</p><p>The second period in the development of the mimetic discretizations begins approximately in the mid-seventies. The new research trend is motivated by the necessity of solving more complicated PDEs with discontinuous coefficients on non-orthogonal meshes. These issues arise naturally in modeling physical problems like the Inertial Confinement Fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[216,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b265">267]</ref>, Tokamak <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[157]</ref>, high velocity impact dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">[277]</ref>, and shape charges <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">[270]</ref>. These models involve domains with complex shapes, several coupled physical processes including gas dynamics, heat conduction, and electromagnetism, and the Lagrangian approach where the mesh moves with fluid. The second period is mainly characterized as follows:</p><p>(i) the derivation of compatible discrete operators based on variational principles and integral identities and not carried out independently for each operator as in the first period;</p><p>(ii) the choice of the local components (with respect to the mesh) of the vector variables used as degrees of freedom;</p><p>(iii) conservative staggered discretizations (using cell and nodal grid functions) of the equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics.</p><p>At the beginning of this period, different variational principles are used to construct systems of mimetic operators. One operator is identified as the primary operator and discretized directly; another operator is constructed through a discrete version of a variational principle and called the derived operator. The use of variational principles in construction of mimetic discretizations is summarized in the books of References <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[233,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b260">262]</ref>. This approach is successfully applied to the heat conduction equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">261]</ref> and the diffusion equations for the magnetic field <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">165]</ref>.</p><p>In these papers and books, the components of the vector variables are used as degrees of freedom. For example, the heat flux and the magnetic flux density B are represented by their normal components to the mesh faces because these components are continuous across the material interfaces. Likewise, the electric field intensity E is represented by its tangential components on the mesh edges because these components are also continuous. For such degrees of freedom, a discretization of integrals in a variational principle becomes a non trivial task and leads to the development of the mimetic inner products. These inner products use discrete representations (for example, E h and E h ) of continuum vector functions (respectively, E and E) to provide accurate approximations of integrals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[E h , E h ] E = Œ© E ‚Ä¢ E dV + O(h p ) ‚àÄE h , E h ‚àà E h ,</formula><p>where h is the characteristic mesh size and p the order of approximation. Note that similar ideas appear in the same years in the finite element community. These ideas are related to the development of mixed finite elements for elliptic and Maxwell's equations, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[208,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">224]</ref>.</p><p>The work of Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">[271]</ref> introduces another approach to the discretization of the Maxwell's equations, the finite integration technique (FIT), which uses the primary mesh for the discretization of Faraday's induction law and a dual mesh for the discretization of the Maxwell-Amp√©re's law. An interpolation of the electric field E and the magnetic field H between the meshes is needed to discretize the constitutive relations D = E and B = Œº H, where is the electric permittivity and Œº is the magnetic permeability of the medium. Only later, it was recognized that the interpolation must satisfy special properties for the method to be stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77]</ref>. It is pertinent to note that the mimetic discretizations developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">165,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">261]</ref> do not use a dual mesh. For further historical connections to the mixed finite element and other methods, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[149]</ref>; see also subsection 3.1.2.</p><p>As it has been mentioned above, algebraic topology provides a natural framework to describe discrete structures. By applying it to the electromagnetics (see, for example, the book of Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref> and the references therein) formal mathematical structures can be introduced such as edge elements and facet elements. Such structures correspond to the mimetic discretizations of the electric and magnetic fields. The main difficulty here is in the construction of consistent adjoint operators or, using the terminology of the algebraic topology, the discrete analogs of the Hodge * operator (compare this issue with the interpolation issue in the FIT method). Some contributions regarding this issue are in <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[110]</ref>. The application of the algebraic topology to the construction of a discrete analog of the metric conjugacy operator * on general grids requires a complex set of mathematical tools. Moreover, this approach is natural for specific discretizations of vector fields and cannot be easily extended to many popular discretizations including those using the nodal Cartesian components of the vector fields.</p><p>The variational principles are also actively used to construct conservative finite difference methods on staggered grids for gas dynamics, magneto-hydrodynamics and dynamics of deformable media, see References <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[126]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[127]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[128]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b258">260]</ref> and Sections 6 and 7 for more details.</p><p>It is worth noting that in this period the variational principles are used only in the construction of derived operators from given primary operators. This fact is reflected in several very important papers, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">161,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b227">229,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b234">236,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b235">237]</ref> that can be truly considered as the beginning of the systematic development of the MFD method. In these papers, the design principles for the MFD method described in Section 1.1 are already clearly formulated. In particular, we find the notions of discrete spaces equipped with inner products, primary operators, constructive way of using duality relationships to build derived operators, and the connection of the duality properties and related integral identities with the desired properties for a discrete model.</p><p>In this period, these methods are not called mimetic. The closest translation from Russian into English is "support operator method ". This translation does not make much sense, besides the fact that the discrete operators support the derivation of numerical schemes for PDEs. Most of these papers were translated into English by publishers and the method was given other names such as "basic operators" and "reference operators".</p><p>Subsequent publications, that we list in almost chronological order, demonstrate a wide use of the mimetic approach. Axisymmetric difference operators in orthogonal coordinate systems are constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[163,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">164]</ref>. Mimetic discrete operators for the Voronoi meshes are developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">[244]</ref>. Mimetic discretizations for elliptic equations on non-matching grid are developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[246]</ref>. Mimetic discretizations for Maxwell's equations in the cylindrical geometry on an orthogonal grid are developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[94]</ref>. The approach is also extended to the heat conduction equation on the Voronoi/Dirichlet meshes <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">[245]</ref> and to gas dynamics equations on the Voronoi meshes in the framework of free-Lagrangian methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[203,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b237">239,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b241">243]</ref>. Mimetic approach is used for the biharmonic equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">[248]</ref>.</p><p>During this period, various publications are focused on the analysis of stability and convergence properties of the mimetic discretizations, cf. <ref type="bibr">[13-15, 87, 125, 227]</ref>. In most of these papers, the stability and convergence results are proved in the energy norms induced by the mimetic inner products.</p><p>Mimetic discretizations are also applied to practically important problems. We mention a few representative papers: Navier-Stokes equations on the Voronoi meshes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>; static problems of elasticity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[162]</ref>; modeling of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[119]</ref>; modeling compression of a toroidal plasma by the quasi-spherical liner, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">118]</ref>; modeling of a controlled laser fusion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">[268]</ref>; computer simulations of an over-compressed detonation wave in a conic canal, <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[158]</ref>; simulation of a magnetic field in a spiral band reel, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62]</ref>; calculation of viscous incompressible liquid flow with a free surface on two dimensional Lagrangian meshes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[86]</ref>; modeling of a microwave plasma generator, <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[193]</ref>; simulation of the collapse of a quasi-spherical target in a hard cone, <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">[256]</ref>.</p><p>The design principles of the mimetic discretizations developed during the second period are summarized in the book referenced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[238]</ref>. There, the author applies the support operator method to the construction of mimetic methods for elliptic and parabolic equations as well as to the Lagrangian gas dynamics. Only nodal and cell-centered discretizations of vector and scalar functions are considered in this book. The book is accompanied by a computer disk containing examples of codes implementing the mimetic schemes. Note also publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[240]</ref> where the support operator method is used for the discretization of elliptic problems.</p><p>Several papers published in the second period study a different approach to mimetic discretizations; namely, compatible discretizations for the Lagrangian hydrodynamics, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">64]</ref>. In these papers, the differential operators are not approximated directly, but rather compatible discretizations for the momentum and internal energy equations are derived through a balance of the kinetic and internal energy that conserves the total energy. This approach, although specific to the hydrodynamics equations, is quite general. It can be applied to the case where forces of arbitrary nature (not just forces generated by differential operators) are present in the momentum equation, see subsection 6.6 for more details.</p><p>Finally, we mention other papers published during this period that contain mimetic ideas: <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[210]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[211]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[212]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[213]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">[226]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[198,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">199]</ref>. In particular, the work of Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[198]</ref> emphasizes the fact that a discretization of the divergence operator has to be consistent with the change of volume of the computational cell. The same idea is used to construct a mimetic discretization in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[127]</ref>.</p><p>The third period in the development of the mimetic discretizations begins approximately in the mid-nineties. The main characteristics of the third period are:</p><p>(i) the beginning of a systematic development of the mathematical foundation of the mimetic discretizations and the DVTC;</p><p>(ii) the extension of the mimetic approach to more general meshes including polygonal, locally refined and non-matching meshes;</p><p>(iii) an extensive and careful testing of mimetic discretizations for many different problems.</p><p>The systematic development of the mathematical foundation for the DVTC begins in three seminal papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[146]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[147]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[148]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[147]</ref>, natural discrete analogs (primary mimetic operators) for grad, curl and div on logically rectangular grids are constructed. Discrete analogs of several important theorems of the continuum calculus are also proved, as, for example, that div A = 0 if and only if A = curl B. The internal structure of the primary operators is described in terms of primitive difference and metric operators. In this paper, the terminology mimetic difference operators and mimetic discretizations is adopted for the first time, although the word mimetic had already been used in the unpublished report <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[145]</ref>.</p><p>The discrete dual operators (the derived mimetic operators) corresponding to the primary operators are constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[146]</ref>. The construction of the derived operators is based on the duality principle, e.g.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[u h , GRAD p h ] F = -[DIV u h , p h ] C , ‚àÄu h ‚àà F h , p h ‚àà C h ,</formula><p>where F h and C h are discrete spaces for face and cell grid functions, respectively. The inner products in discrete spaces are introduced and corresponding SPD matrices are developed. The structure of the derived operators in terms of primitive difference operators and the inner product matrices is described. The discrete analogs of major theorems of vector calculus are also presented. The set of primary and derived discrete operators allows one to construct discrete analogs of second-order operators like div grad, grad div, curl curl, and the vector Laplace operator Œî = grad divcurl curl, which are needed to discretize various PDEs. The discrete analogs of the Helmholtz orthogonal decomposition theorem for logically rectangular meshes for both face and edge representation of vector fields is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[150]</ref>. Extension to general meshes is developed in subsection 2.5. The DVTC is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> to construct a data transfer algorithm for divergence-free fields represented by normal components to mesh faces. Its extension to general meshes is described in subsection 2.8. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref>, the mimetic approach is used to discretize the divergence of a tensor and the gradient of a vector using two different representations of the tensor field via normal projections to mesh faces and tangential projections to mesh edges.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[148]</ref>, the discrete operators are extended to the boundary by incorporating the boundary conditions into their definition. For example, on the boundary, the discrete divergence operator is equal to the normal component of its vector argument. The inner products are to be modified to include the boundary terms, and using these new inner products, the derived gradient operator is still the negative adjoint of the (extended) divergence operator. This strategy allows us to discretize Neumann and Robin boundary conditions for elliptic equations in a natural way using the framework of mimetic discretizations.</p><p>The mimetic inner product is usually not unique. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[152]</ref>, the impact of the inner product on the accuracy of the MFD method is investigated. Two inner products, which correspond to different interpolations of a vector field inside a mesh cell, are compared. It is shown that the absolute error is two-three times smaller when the interpolation is based on the Piola transformation compared to the piecewise constant interpolation. This work is the first analysis of optimal lifting operators, see the next period. It is pertinent to note that the non-uniqueness of the mimetic inner product is also analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">[209]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[266]</ref> to develop a unified formulation for the covolume method and the support operator method in two dimensions.</p><p>Another important paper of this period is found in Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[190]</ref>. There, the equations for the mimetic inner product matrix are derived from accuracy considerations, in particular, from the requirement that the discrete gradient be exact for linear functions. A solution to this problem is proposed for triangular meshes.</p><p>The mimetic inner products for vector functions developed in the aforementioned papers are not suitable to degenerate quadrilateral cells, i.e. cells with 180 ‚Ä¢ angle between two edges or cells having edges with zero length, non-convex cells and cells with hanging nodes (degenerate polygons). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[174]</ref>, a new approach for the construction of inner products for general polygonal cells is proposed, which is extends to the mimetic setting the mixed finite element method for polygonal and polyhedral meshes for Darcy flow calculations proposed in [1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">175,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">176]</ref>. Each cell is subdivided into triangles and new temporary unknowns are introduced on internal edges. Then, the standard mimetic inner product is defined for each triangle and, finally, the temporary unknowns are eliminated using two conditions: the discrete divergence is constant in the cell and the inner product satisfies the stability condition (S2), see Section 2. This approach works for arbitrarily-shaped polygons. Moreover, the inner product depends continuously on the shape of the cell, for example, this is the case when a quadrilateral degenerates to a triangle. The same construction is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[188]</ref> for arbitrary polyhedral meshes.</p><p>A conceptually new development of the mimetic discretizations is the introduction of the local support operator method for diffusion problems, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[204]</ref>, where both cell and face unknowns are used to represent the scalar variable. This approach makes it possible to reformulate the discrete problem in order to use efficient algebraic solvers for the resulting linear systems. The new approach is used to construct mimetic discretizations on triangular meshes <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[116]</ref>, meshes with local refinement <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[184]</ref>, and non-matching meshes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>. High-order mimetic discretizations, which use a wider stencil, are developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">75]</ref>.</p><p>During the third period convergence results for the mimetic discretizations are obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">153]</ref> for diffusion problems. The second-order convergence (superconvergence) of the vector variable on smooth meshes is proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>. A mortar technique for mimetic discretizations on non-matching meshes is developed and analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</p><p>In this period, the mimetic discretizations are applied to a wide range of problem: diffusion equations with strongly discontinuous anisotropic coefficients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[142,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">144,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">241]</ref>; Maxwell's equations and equations of a magnetic diffusion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[149,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">151]</ref>; equations of the Lagrangian hydrodynamics on general polygonal meshes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>, including an artificial viscosity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref>; equations of a solid dynamics and shallow water equations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[197]</ref>; and the Lagrangian hydrodynamics on curvilinear logically rectangular meshes preserving spatial symmetries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[196]</ref>.</p><p>The foundation for the systematic development of conservative compatible/mimetic discretizations based on a balance of the kinetic and internal energy is found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref> (see also subsection 6.6). The reader may also be interested in the review paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[160]</ref> where some other mimetic properties of numerical algorithms are discussed, as well as in the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[222]</ref> where conservation properties of unstructured staggered discretizations are discussed.</p><p>The fourth period in the development of the mimetic discretizations begins after the IMA meeting in 2004 <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[97]</ref>. It is based on the collaboration between the Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA, and a research group in Pavia, Italy. The main characteristics of this period are:</p><p>(i) the development of new mathematical tools for the design of mimetic discretizations of various PDEs and their convergence analysis;</p><p>(ii) the development of a rich parametric family of mimetic discretizations that includes many other discretization methods as particular members;</p><p>(iii) the application of the new technology to a wide range of PDEs, the development of arbitraryorder discretizations for elliptic problems, the analysis of stability and of discrete maximum principles.</p><p>The set of new mathematical tools introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref> form the foundation for a rigorous convergence theory for the mimetic discretizations. The subsequent papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59]</ref> develop a new approach to the construction of derived mimetic operators on arbitrary polyhedral meshes. The key component of this construction is an accurate mimetic inner product. This inner product is built to satisfy the consistency and stability conditions that enforce the optimal convergence rate of discrete solutions and lead to independent cell-based algebraic problems. Such construction is easy to implement in a computer code. A strategy for a systematic development of mimetic inner products for cochain spaces is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">54]</ref>.</p><p>The consistency and stability conditions have already appeared in a different form in <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[190]</ref>, but the new approach results in a number of important developments that are more transformational than incremental. First, the new consistency condition can be formulated for non-convex polygonal and polyhedral cells, including cells with non-planar faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>. Second, the consistency and stability conditions do not determine a single scheme but an entire family of schemes. All members of this family share common properties such as accuracy and stability and have the same stencil size for the derived operators. Third, such family of schemes contains many well-known finite volume and finite element methods.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">58]</ref>, the new technology is used to develop and analyze a mimetic discretization for generalized polyhedral meshes having strongly non-flat mesh faces. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[186]</ref>, it is applied to build a mimetic discretization for equations of the magnetic diffusion in the axisymmetric cylindrical geometry. This scheme provides an accurate treatment of the B/r 2 term near the axis of symmetry r = 0 and leads to a consistent calculation of the Joule heating on strongly distorted meshes.</p><p>The families of mimetic schemes are analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">182,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">183]</ref> and sub-families of schemes with additional properties are found. The mimetic schemes satisfying a discrete maximum principle for diffusion problems are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[182,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">183]</ref> for a class of two-dimensional and threedimensional meshes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[133]</ref>, a new mimetic scheme for a well-studied acoustics equation is developed. This scheme has the complexity of roughly two second-order schemes but shows fourth-order numerical dispersion and sixth-order numerical anisotropy. The last property has never been reported for other state-of-the-art fourth-order schemes.</p><p>The mathematical tools for building accurate mimetic inner products have been extended to semi-inner products representing the energy norm. This extension allowed us to build new mimetic discretizations for primary formulations of second-order PDEs. A nodal mimetic discretization on polygonal and polyhedral meshes for elliptic problems is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>, where the optimal convergence estimate in the energy norm is proved. Later, this technology has been extended to Reissner-Mindlin plates <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> and the Stokes equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30]</ref>.</p><p>It turns out that to build higher-order mimetic discretizations, it is sufficient to add more degrees of freedom and enforce a stronger consistency condition. The arbitrary-order mimetic discretizations of diffusion problems are developed and analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, this approach has been recasted as the virtual element method (VEM). The VEM is a finite element method where the discrete spaces are virtual in the sense that they are not build explicitly but are characterized by their properties. The practical implementation of the VEM is based on the mimetic inner products.</p><p>The new mimetic discretizations have demonstrated their efficiency in solving convectiondiffusion problems in both diffusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref> and convection-dominated regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, eigenvalue problems in mixed form <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>, mixed formulation of a linear elasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>, obstacle problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, modeling of biological suspensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[134]</ref>, and modeling of flows in porous media <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[185]</ref>.</p><p>A residual-based a posteriori estimators for mimetic discretizations have been developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32]</ref>. The estimators use a post-processing technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[69]</ref> and can be applied to an adaptive solution of elliptic problems.</p><p>In the fourth period, development, analysis, and application of the mimetic discretizations have been done in various research groups in Europe and US: subsurface flows on corner-point meshes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>; development of mimetic discretizations based on a discrete calculus for fluid dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[155,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">223,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">250]</ref>, geophysical flows, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b223">225,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b256">258]</ref>; oil reservoir simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">242]</ref>; seismic wave propagation on multi-GPU system <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">[247]</ref>; viscoelastic wave modeling and rupture dynamics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[120,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">121]</ref>; poroelasticity problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[207]</ref>; electromagnetics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">191,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">192]</ref>; plasma physics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[221]</ref>; astrophysics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[206]</ref>; pharmaceutical science, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79]</ref>; general relativity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>; and image processing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Alternative approaches to compatible discretization</head><p>The idea of incorporating properties of the continuum calculus in the design of numerical schemes appears in various methods. In a series of articles published in the seventies (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[263,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">264]</ref> and the references therein), it was observed that many physical theories have a very similar formal structure from the geometrical, algebraic and analytic standpoints. For example, balance equations, continuity equations, equations of motion, and circuital equations state that one physical quantity defined on a d-dimensional manifold is equal to another physical quantity defined on its boundary. The equations can be reformulated in a finite framework using basic concepts from the algebraic topology such as fully discrete functions (cochains) defined on combination of grid objects (chains) rather than functions in the continuum. Going further along this direction, it is possible to establish a set of direct algebraic relations among geometrically-based physical variables that is suitable to numerical applications, e.g., the cell method (CM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[200,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b263">265]</ref>. Although the CM is derived directly from the experimental laws, thus avoiding a discretization of differential equations, its mimetic nature is evident per se. The CM is consistent by design; however, it may result in a non-symmetric discretization for a symmetric problem. Moreover, since the stability condition is not one of the design principles, the CM may lead to an unstable discretization on a strongly distorted mesh.</p><p>A unified computational model is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">219,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">220]</ref> to make a bridge between the geometry and the physical behavior of engineering systems. This model uses differential k-forms and their discrete representation through k-cochains over a cell complex, a finite approximation to a manifold which abstracts only its topological properties, and the coboundary operator acting on cochains to represent a geometry-based differentiation process. It turns out that only a small set of the usual combinatorial operators, e.g., boundary, coboundary, and dualization, are sufficient to represent a variety of physical laws and invariants. Cochains as a numerical discretization mechanism and connection with a finite element analysis are also investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[219]</ref>.</p><p>The covolume method <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[212]</ref> is another example of a compatible discretization method. This method was originally developed for the numerical approximation of planar divcurl systems and was extended later to three-dimensional systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[213]</ref>, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Maxwell's equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[210]</ref>. It can be viewed as a significant extension of Yee's method to simplicial meshes, and thus can be applied to complex geometries. Like the FDTD, the covolume method requires two orthogonal meshes to approximate the electric and magnetic fields. This is one of its major features but also its major limitation. To this purpose, the Delaunay triangulation and the corresponding Voronoi diagram are the natural choice. Every edge of the Voronoi mesh is orthogonal to the corresponding face of the Delaunay triangulation, and viceversa. The covolume and MFD method use the same primary operators. However, the construction of the dual operators in the covolume method relies strongly on the orthogonality property of the Delaunay and Voronoi meshes.</p><p>Mimetic ideas are also found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[217,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">218]</ref>, where finite difference approximations of differential operators on logically rectangular grids and weighted inner products are designed so that a summation by parts formula mimicking the integration by parts holds. The analogy between the discrete and the continuum calculus is rather strong, as stability estimates for these finite difference schemes are obtained following the argument used for continuum initial and boundary value problems, including hyperbolic, parabolic, and mixed hyperbolic-parabolic systems. Further developments are found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[202,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b251">253]</ref>, where the Euler equations are solved using an energy-stable scheme based on the fifth-order summation-by-parts operators.</p><p>The finite volume (FV) method, originally introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">101]</ref> for the heat equation and dubbed as the integrated finite difference method, forms, perhaps, the largest class of schemes that can handle unstructured polygonal and polyhedral meshes, non-linear problems, and problems with anisotropic coefficients. These schemes are mimetic in the sense that they enforce the balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy on each mesh cell. The discrete operators in the balance equations coincide with the primary mimetic operators; e.g., the balance of fluxes corresponds to the primary divergence operator acting on face grid functions. The essential difference between the FV and MFD methods is in the approximation of constitutive laws. We mention here only those developments of the FV method that use duality arguments for that.</p><p>An FV approximation of the convection-diffusion equation based on a two-point flux formula is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[135]</ref>. The formulation of this scheme requires a special mesh such as the Voronoi tessellation. To overcome this limitation, a class of FV methods, consistent by design, is proposed by introducing additional unknowns on mesh faces. Examples of such methods include the hybrid finite volume method <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">105]</ref>, and the mixed finite volume method <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[98]</ref>. These FV methods introduce stabilization terms that can be connected with the stability condition of the mimetic finite difference method, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[99]</ref>. A different class of FV methods is introduced by using a diamond gradient formula and suitable vertex-centered reconstructions <ref type="bibr">[40-42, 83, 114, 115, 194, 195]</ref>. The discrete divergence and the discrete gradient operators in these latter schemes satisfies a duality relation only approximately. Instead, an exact duality relation is satisfied by the discrete duality finite volume (DDFV) method for two-dimensional diffusion problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">138]</ref>. The resulting scheme combines two distinct FV schemes on two overlapping meshes, the primal mesh where the diamond scheme is formulated, and a dual mesh of control volumes built around the vertices of the primal mesh. The method can be reformulated in the framework of mimetic discretizations on staggered grids by introducing discrete divergence and gradient operators which are related by a discrete analog of the integration by parts formula through two inner products defined on the overlapping meshes <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[82]</ref>. A generalization to nonlinear elliptic equations is found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, to Stokes equations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[170,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">171]</ref>, and to the div-curl problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[85]</ref>. A generalization of the DDFV method to three-dimensional problems is feasible, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81]</ref>; however, the scheme formulation is quite complex as it requires three three-dimensional overlapping meshes and one additional mesh of diamond cells.</p><p>Another approach to overcome the limitations induced by the two-point flux formula comes from the multi-point flux approximation (MPFA) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4]</ref> and similar, but developed independently, the control-volume distributed (CVD) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">103]</ref>. In the MPFA and CVD methods, fluxes on mesh interfaces having a common point are defined simultaneously from local consistency and continuity conditions. On general meshes, these methods produce non-symmetric schemes for symmetric problems. A lack of a stability condition may result in numerical instabilities on strongly distorted meshes. The MPFA method can be reformulated using the mixed finite element framework as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b270">[272]</ref> or the mimetic framework with inner products induced by non-symmetric matrices as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[189]</ref>. The latter approach is also used to analyze convergence of the MPFA method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[159]</ref>.</p><p>The mixed finite element (MFE) method is, perhaps, the most developed compatible discretization framework, mainly on simplicial meshes.

An important review of basic concepts of the mimetic discretizations and their relations with notions from the algebraic topology is found in Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Annotated content</head><p>The paper outline is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the basic elements of the discrete vector and tensor calculus on general polyhedral meshes. Using first principles, we derive three primary discrete operators GRAD, CURL, and DIV. Using duality arguments, we construct the three derived operators DIV, CURL, and GRAD, which combined with the primary operators satisfy discrete exact identities and discrete Helmholtz decomposition theorems. Similar results were obtained for two-dimensional logically rectangular meshes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[146,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">150]</ref>. Here, they are extended to general unstructured polygonal and polyhedral meshes. Then, we describe an extension of the DVTC on manifolds and its application to the problem of data transfer between unstructured meshes for a divergence-free vector field. These results are an extension of the algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> for logically rectangular meshes. At the end of this section, we give a short description of mimetic discretizations of the divergence of a tensor and the gradient of a vector, which extends the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref> to unstructured polyhedral meshes.</p><p>In Section 3, we summarize a few important applications of the mimetic methodology to the discretization of classical PDEs. We start with the diffusion equation that uses DIV and GRAD operators, derive mimetic inner products, and present a priory convergence estimates. The presentation is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59]</ref>. Next, we describe mimetic discretizations for Maxwell's equations, equations of magnetic diffusion, and magnetostatics that use CURL and CURL operators.

We introduce the notion of a general compatible discretization, specific for the Lagrangian hydrodynamics, where discrete forces in the momentum equation are defined in a compatible way to conserve the total energy. We also describe a tensor artificial viscosity needed for modeling flows with shocks.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Elements of a discrete vector and tensor calculus</head><p>A discrete vector and tensor calculus (DVTC) is in the core of the mimetic discretization technology. It allows us to reproduce various exact identities in a discrete framework, e.g., the Helmholtz decomposition theorems (see subsection 2.5), and to preserves symmetry and positivity of discrete operators. The DVTC directly deals with discrete functions and discrete operators and can be build in a very abstract form that exploits only the duality relationship and the properties of the inner products. On its turn, the convergence analysis imposes a few additional limitations on the admissible inner products but leaves enough freedom to vary them for various benefits.</p><p>The definition of the primary operators of the DVTC follows naturally from the coordinate invariant definitions of gradient, divergence, and curl operators and the use of the degrees of freedom associated with various mesh objects. A different set of primary and derived operators will be considered in Section 6.</p><p>The coordinate invariant definitions of the first-order operators are given by various forms and modifications of the Stokes formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x b xa ‚àÇp ‚àÇœÑ dL = p(x a ) -p(x b ), (2.1) S (curl u) ‚Ä¢ n dS = ‚àÇS u ‚Ä¢ œÑ dL, (2.2) V div u dV = ‚àÇV u ‚Ä¢ n dS,<label>(2.3)</label></formula><p>where œÑ is the unit vector tangent to either a curve connecting points x a and x b or a polygonal boundary ‚àÇS, ‚àÇp/‚àÇœÑ is the directional derivative of the scalar field p along such curves, and n is the unit normal vector to the surface S or ‚àÇV . The second formula requires the proper orientation of normal and tangent vectors (see below). Hereafter, we use bold symbols to indicate a vector function or a tensor. The first-order operators satisfy the duality relations that are given by various Green's for-mulas (integration by parts formulas):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Œ© p div u dV = - Œ© (grad p) ‚Ä¢ u dV + ‚àÇŒ© p (u ‚Ä¢ n) dS. (2.4) Œ© u ‚Ä¢ div œÉ dV = - Œ© (grad u) ‚Ä¢ œÉ dV + ‚àÇŒ© u ‚Ä¢ (œÉ ‚Ä¢ n) dS. (2.5) Œ© u ‚Ä¢ (curl v) dV = Œ© (curl u) ‚Ä¢ v dV + ‚àÇŒ© p (u √ó v) ‚Ä¢ n dS. (2.6)</formula><p>The DVTC preserves the duality property by deriving one of the discrete operators from first principles (2.1)-(2.3) (the primary operator) and the other one by using a discrete analog of an integration by parts formula (the derived operator).</p><p>PDEs have often variables coefficients. In the mimetic approach, the coefficients are embedded in the definition of the derived operator. Consider, for examples, an equivalent form of formula (2.4):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Œ© p div u dV = - Œ© K -1 (K grad p) ‚Ä¢ u dV + ‚àÇŒ© p (u ‚Ä¢ n) dS,<label>(2.7)</label></formula><p>where K is a positive definite tensor. This formula represents the duality between the two first operators div and K grad using a weighted inner product for the vector fields (with K -1 as weight). The corresponding discrete operators will be in a duality relation with respect to such inner product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 2.1. To simplify the presentation, we consider the Green's formulas in functional spaces</head><p>where the boundary integrals in (2.4)-(2.7) are zeros. This implies indirectly homogeneous essential boundary conditions in the underlying PDEs. The treatment of heterogeneous boundary conditions can be done by extending the first-order operators to the boundary and building a new DTVC, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[148]</ref> for more details. Other solutions are also possible, see Section 3.</p><p>Let us consider two discrete spaces S, S and a primary operator D acting from S onto S , which, in practice, may be grad, curl and div. The (unique) injective operator D acting from S into S is defined implicitly via the duality relationship:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">[D(u), v] S = [u, D (v)] S , ‚àÄu ‚àà S, v ‚àà S ,<label>(2.8)</label></formula><p>where the brackets denote inner products (possibly weighted by problem coefficients) in the aforementioned discrete spaces. By taking v = D(u) we obtain the inequality:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">[D (D(u)), u] S = [D(u), D(u)] S ‚â• 0, ‚àÄu ‚àà S.</formula><p>(2.9)</p><p>By properly choosing the discrete spaces S and S and the primary operator D, we always get a consistent derived operator D such that (2.9) holds. This inequality leads to the symmetry and positivity of the arising discrete system if these properties exist in a continuum problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Polyhedral meshes and mesh sets</head><p>Let Œ© be the computational domain where the PDEs are defined. Without loss of generality, we assume that Œ© is a polyhedral domain in 3-D (a polygonal domain in 2D) with a Lipschitz continuous boundary. More complex geometries can be approximated accurately using a polyhedral domain. Let us consider an unstructured mesh T h with non-overlapping polyhedral (polygonal in 2D) cells c that partition Œ©. We allow c to be a non-convex element with volume |c|, see, e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We denote the faces of c by f , its edges by e, and its vertices (also called nodes) by n.</p><p>Let |f | and |e| denote the area of f and length of e, respectively. In two dimensions, the faces coincide with the edges.</p><p>Let n f be a unit normal vector to face f fixed once and for all, and e be an edge vector with a priori fixed orientation. We assume that e = |e|, where ‚Ä¢ denotes the Euclidean norm of a vector. We also introduce the unit tangent vector œÑ e = e/ e for edge e. Let x c be the centroid of cell c. Similarly, we define centroids x f and x e for face f and edge e, respectively. Finally, x n is the coordinate vector of node n. Extension of the mimetic technology to meshes with non-flat faces is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>. Such meshes appear often in moving mesh methods such as Lagrangian and ALE methods. However, the theoretical analysis of the MFD methods restricts the set of admissible meshes by imposing the following mesh regularity assumption. Let N and Œ± be mesh independent quantities. We consider the following mesh regularity assumption:</p><p>(M1) Each polyhedron can be split into at most N tetrahedra (triangles in 2D) t that are shape regular, i.e. for every t there exists an inscribed ball of radius r t such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r t &gt; Œ± diam(t).</formula><p>This assumption allows us to use meshes with non-convex cells, but limits the number of admissible degenerate cells. For instance, cells with extremely small faces are excluded from the theoretical analysis; however, numerical experiments indicate that these faces do not impact the convergence rate of the MFD methods. We emphasize that this assumption does not require an explicit construction of a tetrahedral subgrid in a computer code, we only need to know that this subgrid does exist.</p><p>We denote the sets of mesh nodes n, edges e, faces f , and cells c by N , E, F, and C, respectively. Let Q be one of these sets. We define the subsets Q(c), Q(f ), and Q(e), which are formed by the mesh objects of Q that are related, respectively, to cell c, face f , and edge e. When the argument has a higher topological dimension, the resulting set</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Q(c), Q(f ), or Q(e)</formula><p>is the collection of mesh objects that belong to the boundary of c, f , and e, respectively. For example, E(c) denotes all the edges forming the boundary of cell c. When the argument has a lower topological dimension, the resulting set Q(f ), Q(e), or Q(n) is the collection of mesh objects sharing cell c, face f , edge e, or node n, respectively. For example, C(e) denotes all cells sharing edge e. When the topological degrees are the same, we consider the subset of items that are connected in some sense to the argument. For example, E(e) is the set of edges sharing at least a node with e. Finally, the symbol |Q(œÉ)| where œÉ may be n, e, f and c is the cardinality of set Q(œÉ), i.e., the number of objects that are in such set; for example, |E(c)| is the number of edges of cell c.</p></div>

For example, let N N and N E be, respectively, the number of nodes and the number of edges of the mesh. Now, the discrete gradient operator GRAD is a rectangular matrix with size N E √ó N N and the expression "v h = GRAD p h " says that the N E -sized vector v h (edge-based degrees of freedom) is given by multiplying the N N -sized vector p h (node-based degrees of freedom) by matrix GRAD. A similar interpretation holds for CURL and DIV.</p><p>Remark 2.3. The matrices representing GRAD, CURL and DIV are the adjacency matrices of the mesh up to a diagonal rescaling of their rows and columns.

Let us assume that the spaces N h , E h , F h , or C h are equipped with inner products (their construction will be discussed in Section 2.6). Applying (2.8) for the primary operators GRAD, CURL, and DIV, we obtain the adjoint operators GRAD , CURL , and DIV .

The preservation of such properties in a discrete setting is one of the most important characteristics of the mimetic discretizations. In this subsection, we show how the mimetic approach satisfies these relations. Let (Q) ‚ä• denote the orthogonal complement of the linear space Q and {0} Q the trivial subspace formed by the zero element.</p><p>Lemma 2.2. Let mesh T h be face-connected.

From the definition given in (2.11) it is obvious that GRAD p h = 0 whenever p h is a constant vector, i.e., all of its entries have the same value. From Remark 2.3 we also know that GRAD is the N E √ó N N -sized adjacency matrix that expresses the topological node-edge connections. Therefore, its rank is equal to (N N -1) and its kernel must have dimension one. This fact implies that the kernel of GRAD coincides with the subspace of the constant vectors in N h .</p><p>Exact identities such as curl grad = 0 and div curl = 0 are preserved by construction of primary and derived operators.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 2.3. Let the domain Œ© and its mesh partition T h be simply connected.

A straightforward calculation shows that CU RL GRAD = 0 and DIV CURL = 0. Let us now assume that CURL v h = 0 for some v h ‚àà E h . We consider a mesh path of consecutive edges {e k } n i k=1 that begins at a fixed vertex n 1 and ends at vertex n i . Then, we consider the discrete field q h ‚àà N h such that the component associated with the vertex n i is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">q n i = q n 1 + n i k=1 Œ± i,k |e k | v e k , (<label>2.28)</label></formula><p>where the value of Œ± i,k , which can be either +1 or -1, depends on the mutual orientation of the corresponding edge e k and the mesh path. The definition of the discrete gradient operator implies that GRAD(q h ) = v h . To complete this part of the proof, we note that q n i does not depends of the mesh path since CURL(v h ) = 0 and the mesh is simply connected. Thus, the value of q n i depends only on the initial value q n 1 in (2.28), i.e., p h is defined up to a constant vector, but this is not a problem since the constant vectors are in the kernel of the discrete gradient operator, cf. Lemma 2.2. Let us assume that DIV(v h ) = 0 for some v h ‚àà F h . The argument based on a direct construction of v h = CURL u h is simple for logically rectangular meshes, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[146,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">147]</ref>, but its extension to general meshes is not trivial. Therefore, we use a different argument that is based on the properties of the continuum operators: for every v h , there exist a continuum vector function v satisfying (2.16). Such a function can be built by solving the Laplace equation in each mesh cell c with a piecewise constant Neumann boundary conditions. By construction div v = 0. Then, there exists a vector potential u ‚àà H 1 (Œ©) 3 (a scalar stream function in 2D) such that v = curl(u). The proof can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[124]</ref>. Applying the previous lemma, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">v f = 1 |f | f v ‚Ä¢ n dS = 1 |f | f (curl u) ‚Ä¢ n dS = 1 |f | e‚ààE(f ) Œ± f,e e u ‚Ä¢ œÑ f dL = CURL u h f ,</formula><p>where the components of the vector u h are the mean values of u ‚Ä¢ œÑ f along the mesh edges.</p><p>Lemma 2.4.

From (2.21) it follows that -M -1 F DIV T M C p h = 0, which implies that DIV T M C p h = 0, or that M C p h ‚àà ker DIV T because M F is a non-singular inner product matrix. Now, a standard algebraic relation and the fact that DIV is a surjective operator yield:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">ker DIV T = img(DIV) ‚ä• = (C h ) ‚ä• = {0} C h ,</formula><p>which implies the lemma's statement.</p><p>This result may seem strange at a first glance as one would expect that the kernel of a discrete gradient operator consists of constant vectors, as it is true for the primary operator GRAD, cf. Lemma 2.2. The considered DTVC assumes that the boundary integrals in formulas (2.4) -(2.6) are zeros and this lemma reflects this fact. Indeed, on an orthogonal mesh, we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">GRAD p h f = (p c 2 -p c 1 )/d 12 if f = F(c 1 ) ‚à© F(c 2 ), -p c 1 /d 1f if f = F(c 1 ) ‚à© ‚àÇŒ©, (2.29)</formula><p>where d 12 is the distance between the centroids of c 1 and c 2 , and d 1f is the distance between the centroid of c 1 and face f .

This inner product matrix integrates exactly a pair of functions p and q if one of them is piecewise constant on the mesh and we know the cell averages of the other function.</p><p>Let us consider the space N h . We can consider different diagonal inner product matrices M N with different approximation properties. The first matrix is assembled from scalar local matrices M N ,c = |c|/|N (c)| I, where I is the properly-sized identity matrix and |N (c)| is the number of nodes of cell c. This matrix is used in Section 6. The construction of the second matrix is based on the formula for the centroid of a polyhedral cell c in terms of the vertex coordinates:</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">x c = n‚ààN (c) œâ c,n x n</formula><p>where œâ c,n is the weight of vertex n. Using these weights, the local inner product in N h,c takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">p h,c , q h,c N ,c = n‚ààN (c) œâ c,n p n q n .</formula><p>When cell c is star-shaped with respect to x c , the weights œâ c,n are positive. Since these weights are assembled on the main diagonal of the cell matrix M N ,c , it is immediate to see that this matrix is diagonal and positive definite. The global matrix M N is also diagonal and positive definite. The quadrature rule associated with the weights œâ c,n is second-order accurate; therefore, the inner product matrix M N integrates exactly the product p q when this function is piecewise linear on T h . The derivation of a mimetic inner product for the remaining spaces F h and E h requires more work. The basic idea is to introduce consistency conditions (exactness for polynomial functions) that lead to algebraic restrictions on the local inner product matrix M Q,c . These algebraic requirements are expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">M Q,c N i = R i , i= 1, 2, . . . , m,<label>(2.45)</label></formula><p>where N i and R i suitably defined column vectors and m is the number of restrictions. Usually, m is less than the size of matrix M Q,c ; thus, we obtain a family of admissible local mimetic inner products, each one of which corresponds to an admissible mimetic scheme. We emphasize the fact that all the mimetic schemes in the family shares the same convergence and stability properties.</p><p>Let N c and R c be two rectangular matrices that contain the vectors N i and R i , respectively, as columns. Precise formulas for N and R will be presented in the next sections for various spaces Q; however, it turns out that the product matrix R T c N c is always symmetric and positive or semi-positive definite.

Let us show by contradiction that this can never occur.</p><p>Let D T c q h,c = 0 and R T c q h,c = 0. The first equality implies that q h,c is orthogonal to the columns of matrix D c . By hypothesis, these columns form a basis for ker(N T c ). Since ker N T c = img(N c ) ‚ä• , q h,c is a linear combination of the columns of matrix N c , i.e. there exists a vector a = 0 such that q h,c = N c a. Inserting this expression in (2.49) and using D T c q h,c = 0 we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">0 = q T h,c R c R T c N c -1 R T c q h,c = a T N T c R c R T c N c -1 (R T c N c )a = a T R T c N c a &gt; 0.</formula><p>This contradiction proves the assertion of the lemma.</p><p>Let k be the size of matrix M Q,c . Then, U c is a symmetric square matrix with size km and is defined by (km + 1) √ó (km)/2 independent parameters. It has been experienced that these parameters may vary of several orders in magnitude with a minor impact on scheme accuracy. Later, we will pose a question of their optimal selection. Corollary 2.1.

Our goal is to remap a discrete vector B h ‚àà F h defined on the original mesh T h to a new discrete vector B h defined on the new mesh T h . We assume that DIV B h = 0 and impose the constraint that the remapped vector be divergence-free, i.e. DIV B h = 0. For clarity of exposition, we do not make any notational distinction between the discrete operators defined on T h and T h , keeping in mind that their definitions are strictly mesh-dependent. The constrained remapping problem is relevant when we deal with magnetic fields or incompressible velocity fields, because in such cases the divergence-free condition has an important physical meaning.</p><p>Let us first clarify the connection between the orientation of edges and normals and the constants Œ± c,f and Œ± f that are used in the definition of the discrete divergence and discrete curl operators introduced in Sec. 2.7. If we choose the counterclock-wise orientation for ‚àÇc and the edge e and the normal vector n e as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, left panel, then, it holds that Œ± c,f = -1 and Œ± f = 1.

The existence of a path is ensured if we consider a simply connected mesh. It is worth noting that, in general, there are many possible paths from n P to n Q . However, the final result does not depend on the choice of the path. Indeed, let us consider two different paths, namely, path and path , that connect nodes n P and n Q , and let A n Q and A n Q be the two values calculated by (2.69) (see illustration on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). It holds that  This strategy yields an explicit procedure for the recovery of vector A h on the original mesh T h that depends only on the single parameter A n P . The recovery step requires to reach each node of the mesh from the node n P in an efficient way, e.g., by visiting each node only once. This task is accomplished by the construction of a spanning tree, which always exists for a simply-connected mesh in two-dimensions but is not unique. For a logically rectangular mesh, a spanning tree is determined easily as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, right panel.</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">A n Q -A n Q = f ‚ààpath |f | B f - f ‚ààpath |f | B f = enclosed cells |c| (DIV B h ) c = 0, (<label>2</label></formula><p>The value at the initial node n P can be set arbitrary, e.g., A n P = 0.

The vector of all the degrees of freedom is denoted, as usual, by u h and the collection of all such vectors (with the obvious definitions of sum of two vectors and multiplication of a vector times a scalar number) forms the node-based linear space N d h , where d = 2, 3 is the space dimension. The dimension of N d h is equal to the number of mesh vertices times d. Now, let us observe that equation (2.10) holds for each component of the vector function u.

They define 12 equations with respect to the unknown matrix A N 3 ,c . We can write these equations in a matrix form resembling (3.47) with 3m √ó 12 rectangular matrices N c and R c in place of N c and R c , respectively, where m = |N (c)|. Let us split q i into two groups. The first group of six functions correspond to different rigid body motions and rotations. Since the symmetrized gradient is zero for these functions, we obtain s h,c (q i ) = 0, i = 1, . . . , 6. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[183]</ref>, a set of sufficient conditions are devised to ensure the monotonicity of the mimetic finite difference method on two-and three-dimensional meshes. To describe the main results, we first re-formulate the method in an algebraically equivalent form. The degrees of freedom for the scalar variable p are associated with the mesh cells c and the mesh faces f . The cell-based degrees of freedom are denoted by p c and represent the cell averages (see <ref type="bibr">(2.18)</ref>). The new face-based degrees of freedom are denoted by p f and represent face-averages:</p><formula xml:id="formula_200">p f ‚âà 1 |f | f p dS. (4.1)</formula><p>We introduce two degrees of freedom per interior mesh face for the vector variables u denoted by u c ,f and u c ,f , where c and c are two cells with the common face f . They represent the face averages of u ‚Ä¢ n c,f (see <ref type="bibr">(2.16</ref>)), where n c,f is the normal vector to face f that point out of cell c. We impose the trivial continuity condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_201">u c ,f + u c ,f = 0. (<label>4.2)</label></formula><p>The goal of introducing additional degrees of freedom is to discretize the duality relationships independently in each mesh cell. Let the boundary of a cell c be formed by the m faces f i , i = 1, . . . m, with measures |f i |. We consider the local vector u h,c that collects the values of u c,f i on the faces f i . Let u h be the vector collecting all local vectors u h,c . The mimetic discretization of the mass balance equation (3.2) reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_202">(DIV u h ) c = 1 |c| f ‚ààF (c) u c,f |f | = b c |c|, (<label>4.3)</label></formula><p>where b c is the cell average of the loading term b.</p><p>The mimetic discretization of the constitutive equation (3.1) uses the local mimetic inner product. Using the definition of the flux field, i.e., u = -K grad p, and applying the Green formula, we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_203">c K -1 u ‚Ä¢ v dV = - c (grad p) ‚Ä¢ v dV = c p div v dV - ‚àÇc p (v ‚Ä¢ n) dS ‚àÄv.</formula><p>Let vector u h,c collect the unknowns u c,f . The discrete analog of the above formula is</p><formula xml:id="formula_204">u h,c , v h,c F ,c = -GRAD p h , v h C,c = p c (DIV v h ) c |c| - f ‚ààF (c) p f v c,f |f | ‚àÄv h,c .</formula><p>Summing up these equations for all the mesh cells, we obtain the discrete duality Green formula used in the definition of the derived gradient operator. This is one of the steps in proving the equivalence of the mimetic formulations considered in Section 3.1 and here. We define W F ,c = M -1 F ,c and rewrite the above equation in the equivalent form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_205">‚éõ ‚éú ‚éú ‚éú ‚éù u c,f 1 u c,f 2 . . . u c,fm ‚éû ‚éü ‚éü ‚éü ‚é† = -W F ,c ‚éõ ‚éú ‚éú ‚éú ‚éù |f 1 | (p f 1 -p c ) |f 2 | (p f 2 -p c ) . . . |f m | (p fm -p c ) ‚éû ‚éü ‚éü ‚éü ‚é† . (4.4) Remark 4.11. If matrix W F ,c is diagonal, then u c,f i = -W c,ii (p f i -p c ), where W c,ii is the i-th diagonal entry of W F ,c</formula><p>. The flux continuity across face f i allows us to eliminate the face-based pressures and obtain a classical two-point flux approximation scheme:</p><formula xml:id="formula_206">u f i = -T f i (p c -p c ), T f i = W c,ii W c ,ii W c,ii + W c ,ii ,</formula><p>where c and c are the two cells sharing face f i . A multi-point flux approximation scheme can be derived through the mimetic framework by controlling the sparsity structure of matrix W F ,c and allowing it to be non-symmetric, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[189]</ref> for details. The new sparsity structure allows us to collect face-based pressure unknowns into small independent groups around mesh points. The elimination of these scalar unknowns leads to an MPFA-type scheme. Also, the MFD framework leads to a new family of cell-centered schemes of MPFA-type for the case when four or more faces in a cell meet at a corner. The MFD framework has also been used to analyze some MPFA schemes, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[159]</ref>.</p><p>Summarizing, the mimetic discretization in the hybrid form reads: find the cell-based values p c , the face-based values p f and u c,f that satisfy the three equations (4.2)-(4.4) and the boundary conditions.</p><p>One of the advantages of the hybrid formulation is that essential and natural boundary conditions are easily imposed. The Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed for face-based values p f . The Neumann boundary conditions are imposed for u c,f . A combination of these variables makes it possible the implementation of Robin boundary conditions.</p><p>As pointed out at the end of subsection 2.6, matrix W F ,c = (w ij ) m i,j=1 can be constructed directly. This is the SPD matrix, and, thus, it is non-singular and its diagonal terms are strictly positive, i.e., w ii &gt; 0.

The first result states the discrete maximum principle that is the discrete analog of Theorem 4.8. Theorem 4.10 (Discrete Maximum Principle). Let (p c ) c‚ààT h and (p f ) f ‚àà Fh be the solution of the hybrid mimetic method and T h be a face-connected mesh. Furthermore, let each matrix W F ,c satisfy assumptions (A1) and (A2). Finally, let b c ‚â§ 0 for all cells c. Then, A minimum principle can be also stated for non-positive input data, i.e., the loading term b and the boundary functions defining the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_209">max c‚ààTc p c ‚â§ max f ‚àà‚àÇŒ© p f .</formula><p>On simplicial meshes and for a particular choice of the mimetic inner product, the MFD method coincides with the low-order Raviart-Thomas mixed-hybrid finite element method. Thus, in this case the conventional angle conditions guaranteeing the discrete maximum principle are recovered.</p><p>On general meshes, Corollary 4.2 leads to a constructive way for designing a monotone MFD method. The sufficient conditions for that are the cell-based inequalities in Assumptions (A1)-(A2). Efficient solutions are found for meshes consisting of parallelograms, parallelepipeds, and orthogonal locally refined elements as those used in the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) methodology. Moreover, on meshes of parallelograms a connection is established with a similar monotonicity condition proposed for the MPFA method <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[215]</ref>.

The uniqueness of the solution to the saddle-point problem requires the null space of DIV T to be trivial.

Such condition states that there exists a positive constant Œ≤ independent of the mesh resolution factor h such that inf</p><formula xml:id="formula_217">q h ‚ààC h sup v h ‚ààN 2 h /{0} [DIV v h , q h ] C v h N ‚â• Œ≤. (5.1)</formula><p>The pair of spaces N 2 h and C h is known to violate the stability condition. However, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> that a slight enrichment of the velocity space is sufficient to prove the inf-sup condition on arbitrary polygonal meshes. This enrichment is done through additional degrees of freedom at selected mesh edges, which represent the normal component of the velocity at the edge mid-points; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9</ref>. The local mesh configuration shown on the right panel leads to a stable method. The other configuration requires one additional velocity unknown. To identify the edges where the additional degrees of freedom have to be added, the following results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> can be used. First, we assume that the maximum number of vertices in a polygonal cell is bounded from above by a constant independent of the mesh resolution. Second, we assume that each cell is shape-regular.</p><p>The algorithm for introducing the additional degrees of freedom is recursive. On each iteration, we may have the local configurations shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">9</ref> without (left) and with (right) additional degrees of freedom. These configurations are considered in Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, respectively.</p><p>Given an internal mesh node n, we consider the sets C(n) and E(n) of the cells and edges sharing the node n. We split E(n) into two complimentary subsets, E b (n) and E x (n), of edges with and without stabilizing degrees of freedom. Let k, k b , and k x = kk b be the number of elements in the sets E(n), E b (n), and E x (n), respectively. Lemma 5.1. Let n be any internal mesh node and the only internal node in C(n). Furthermore, let either (a) k x &lt; 3 or (b) k x = 3 and all the three angles naturally defined by the three edges in E x (n) be less or equal than œÄ. Then, the stability constant Œ≤ does not depend on the mesh.</p><p>A stronger result follows easily from this lemma. We call a frontier ·∫Ω any collection of at least two adjoint mesh edges that separate two mesh cells, ·∫Ω = ‚àÇc ‚à© ‚àÇc , with c, c ‚àà C(n). By our assumptions, Lemma 5.1 considers only superelements C(n) with no frontiers. In a general case, all the internal boundaries among cells in C(n) can be divided into frontiers and regular (single) edges. The next result shows that frontiers can be essentially ignored.  The above result covers, for example, the case of a mesh with convex elements where all the nodes have the property of being the junction of at most 3 edges. For example, the Voronoi meshes satisfy this property and in such a case the result shows that no stabilizing degrees of freedom are needed.</p><p>For a logically square mesh, we need to add the stabilizing degrees of freedom approximately to every fourth edge, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">10</ref>. This is sufficient to kill spurious pressure modes. In a more general case, it is sufficient to add the stabilizing degrees of freedom where needed, as indicated in Lemma 5.2. On polygonal meshes, a small number of additional unknowns is often sufficient for the stability of the method.</p><p>Remark 5.12. The stabilization strategy developed for the Stokes equations can be generalized to other PDEs with a saddle-point structure. This will be the topic for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">High-order MFD schemes</head><p>As stated by Theorem 3.3, the mimetic method for the Darcy equations (3.1)-(3.2) provides a first-order approximation of the velocity u. The first-order accuracy is due to the constant representation of u ‚Ä¢ n on mesh edges, see <ref type="bibr">(2.16)</ref>. Thus, a second-order approximation is expected by using a linear representation. Let h f be the characteristic length associated with f , e.g. Let u f and u 1 f represent the mean and the slope of u ‚Ä¢ n on the mesh face f . The twodimensional case is illustrated on the right panel in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">11</ref>. Using the degrees of freedom, we can define a linear function of each mesh face:</p><formula xml:id="formula_218">h f = |f | in two dimensions and h f = |f | in three dimensions.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_219">u f (x) = u 0 f + x -x f h f ‚Ä¢ u 1 f ‚àÄx ‚àà f. (<label>5.2)</label></formula><p>We define the vector u h as the collection of all the degrees of freedom. Let F h be the corresponding linear space of such vectors.</p><p>The MFD method reads again as in (3.3)-(3.4), but with different primary, DIV, and derived, GRAD, mimetic operators. The divergence theorem stated in <ref type="bibr">(2.15)</ref> suggests us to define the discrete divergence operator on each cell c as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_220">DIV u h c := 1 |c| f ‚ààF (c) Œ± c,f f u f (x) dS. (<label>5.3)</label></formula><p>We substitute (5.2) into the above equation and note that the second integral is zero since x f is the centroid of face f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_221">|c| DIV u h c = f ‚ààF (c) Œ± c,f f u 0 f dS + f x -x f h f ‚Ä¢ u 1 f dS = f ‚ààF (c) Œ± c,f u 0 f |f |.</formula><p>Therefore, the divergence operator has the same structure as in (2.17) but its matrix representation has more zero entries. The mimetic inner product in F h , required to define the derived operator GRAD, must satisfy the consistency and stability conditions. The stability condition is given by (3.8) and guarantees well-posedness of the discrete problem. The consistency condition is similar to condition (S2) and guarantees additional accuracy for the velocity approximation. It reads</p><p>‚Ä¢ (S1c) (linear consistency). Let u h,c and v h,c be the discrete representations of two vectorfunctions u and v in cell c. Furthermore, let u be a linear function, div v be constant in c and fluxes v ‚Ä¢ n f be constant on the faces of c. Finally, let K c be a constant diffusion tensor. Then, the local mimetic inner product u h and v h on each cell c ‚àà C must be exact for the weighted integral of u and v:</p><formula xml:id="formula_222">v h , u h F ,c = c v ‚Ä¢ K -1 c u dV.</formula><p>(5.4)</p><p>The inner product in (5.4) can be expressed using an SPD matrix M F ,c . Let us transform the right-hand side of (5.4). Since u is a linear function, so is K -1 c u. Thus, there exists a quadratic polynomial q such that grad q = K -1 c u. Now, an integration by parts yields:</p><formula xml:id="formula_223">c K -1 c u ‚Ä¢ v dV = c grad q ‚Ä¢ v dV = - c q div v dV + ‚àÇc q n ‚Ä¢ v dS.</formula><p>(5.5)</p><p>The restriction imposed on the function v implies that its divergence coincides with DIV v h . Indeed, by using the divergence theorem, splitting the boundary integral into face contributions, and applying definition (5.3), we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_224">|c| div v = c div v dV = ‚àÇc n ‚Ä¢ v dS = f ‚ààF (c) f v f (x) dS = |c| DIV v h c .</formula><p>Similarly, because v ‚Ä¢ n = v f (x) on f , we can express the last boundary integral in <ref type="bibr">(5.5)</ref> in terms of our degrees of freedom. The exactness relation <ref type="bibr">(5.4)</ref> takes the equivalent form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_225">u h , v h F ,c = - c DIV v h c q dV + f ‚ààF (c) f v f (x) q dS, (<label>5.6)</label></formula><p>or, equivalently,</p><formula xml:id="formula_226">v T h,c M F ,c u h,c = v T h,c w h,c</formula><p>, where w h,c depends on q and the cell geometry. Taking various linearly independent linear functions u, we build algebraic requirements (see, for example, (2.45)) for the matrix M F ,c . Construction of the matrix M F ,c is completed through Lemma 2.9. Remark 5.13. When tensor K is not constant on c, the consistency condition (5.4) still holds and so is (5.6), but now vector u h must be the discrete representation of Œ† 1 c (K grad q), where Œ† 1 c is the orthogonal projector onto the linear vector-functions defined on cell c, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">130]</ref>.</p><p>The second-order convergence of the flux approximation can be theoretically proved when the error is measured in the mesh-dependent norms</p><formula xml:id="formula_227">||| ‚Ä¢ ||| F = [‚Ä¢, ‚Ä¢] 1/2 F</formula><p>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Lagrangian hydrodynamics</head><p>In this Section, we consider the mimetic (compatible) discretizations of the equations of the Lagrangian hydrodynamics:</p><formula xml:id="formula_229">dœÅ dt + œÅ div u = 0, œÅ du dt = -grad p, œÅ dŒµ dt = -p div u, p = EOS(Œµ, œÅ), (6.1)</formula><p>where u is the velocity, p is the pressure, œÅ is density, Œµ is the internal energy and EOS (‚Ä¢) represents a suitable equation of state.</p><p>In the Lagrangian hydrodynamics the mesh is moving with fluid and the mass of each cell does not change in time. The fact that the mesh follows the fluid suggests us to discretize the velocity at the mesh nodes, u n = (u n , v n ). Let u h ‚àà N 2 h be the vector of all velocity unknowns. For such discretization of the velocity, it is natural to use a cell-centered pressure, p c , when we discretize the pressure gradient in the momentum equation. Let p h ‚àà C h be the vector of all pressure unknowns. The density œÅ is defined as the mass of the cell, m c , divided by its volume V c . Hence, its discrete analog is also associated with the cell c, i.e., œÅ c = m c /V c . This and the equations of state suggests us to use a cell-based discretization of the internal energy, Œµ c . This approach is called the staggered discretization (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">12</ref>) and is used in most production hydrocodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. In such codes, a non-conservative form of the energy equation is used often, see (6.1). The staggered approach facilitates the discretization of the internal energy equation by using a discrete divergence operator that acts from nodes to cells.</p><p>The mimetic discretization of the equations of the Lagrangian hydrodynamics must conserve mass, momentum and total energy to model the motion of a compressive fluid accurately. The form of the internal energy equation implies that the total energy is conserved if the discrete gradient and divergence operators are negative adjoint to each other. This leads to a new DVTC based on discrete duality relations like that developed in Section 2.</p><p>There are two ways to define a discrete divergence operator DIV : N 2 h ‚Üí C h using different fundamental continuum relations. The first way is based on the divergence theorem. Note that this is not the operator defined in subsection (2.2), because the unknowns now are the nodal velocities u n rather than the averaged normal components of the velocity on mesh faces. This leads to a larger null space for the operator DIV. When parasitic null space modes are triggered, they produce the nonphysical hourglass motion of a quadrilateral mesh. The second way is based on the connection between the divergence operator and the change of volume of the mesh cells. It is a remarkable fact that these two distinct strategies lead to the same operator DIV in the Cartesian coordinate system.</p><p>To ensure the adjointness property, the discrete gradient operator, GRAD : C h ‚Üí N 2 h , is defined through a duality relation. The derived gradient has also a non-trivial null space. For example, on a square mesh, the spurious mode in the null space has the checker-board pattern.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that there exist methods where a discrete gradient operator is chosen as the primary operator and a discrete divergence operator is derived by duality. These operators are still negative adjoint to each other by construction, which guarantees the conservation of the total energy. Unfortunately, the primary gradient is defined on a dual mesh, and the explicit construction of this mesh may be a difficult task, especially in three dimensions.</p><p>To summarize, we consider a new pair of dual discrete operators DIV and GRAD. A complete formulation of a discrete calculus for these operators is still an open research topic. Despite some shortcomings, these operators are widely used in the Lagrangian hydrocodes; therefore, analysis of their properties, and in general mimetic discretizations of the equations of the Lagrangian hydrodynamics, is of great interest to practitioners. The presentation in subsections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b236">238]</ref>.</p><p>More general equations of the Lagrangian hydrodynamics may use forces of different nature that either come from coupled physical models, such as the magneto-hydrodynamics, or are introduced for numerical stability, such as artificial viscosity forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref> or forces that control artificial grid motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>. In some cases, these forces cannot be interpreted as discrete analogs of continuous operators. This fact leads to a more general concept of compatible discretizations for the Lagrangian hydrodynamics: instead of the discrete operators we use a force-based compatible discretization of the momentum and the internal energy equations that conserve the total energy. The generic form of such a discretization is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>. A discretization of the momentum equation is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_230">m n du n dt = - c‚ààC(n) f c,n ,<label>(6.2)</label></formula><p>where m n is mass of the node, which does not depend on time, and f n c is the corner force, which expresses the force from cell c to node (vertex) n of this cell.

In subsection 6.8 we consider another mimetic property of the discretization of the Lagrangian hydrodynamics equations, namely, the exact preservation of the spherical symmetry by working with cylindrical r, z coordinates on a logically rectangular curvilinear grid.

(6.6)</formula><p>The corresponding differential equation is the first equation in (6.1). The conservation of the momentum is expressed by the second equation in (6.1). In most Lagrangian hydrocodes, the equation for the internal energy Œµ, the third equation in (6.1), is discretized in a non-conservative form. The system of equations is finally closed by the equation of state, p = EOS(Œµ, œÅ).</p><p>Let us discuss which conservation laws we need to preserve in the discrete setting and how these conservation laws depend on the properties of the differential operators. First, let us consider the geometric conservation law, which connects the change of the volume of a fluid particle Œ¥V (t) moving with the velocity field u:</p><formula xml:id="formula_235">d dt (Œ¥V ) = d dt Œ¥V (t) dV = ‚àÇ(Œ¥V (t)) u ‚Ä¢ n dS, (6.7)</formula><p>where n is the unit vector orthogonal to ‚àÇV (t) and pointing out of V (t). Equation (6.7) can be obtained from the mass conservation equation. In the Lagrangian methods the density is defined as œÅ = Œ¥m/Œ¥V . Inserting this expression into the first equation in (6.1) and using the fact that the mass Œ¥m does not change in time, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_236">d dt (Œ¥V ) = Œ¥V div u.<label>(6.8)</label></formula><p>Therefore, to be consistent with the conservation of mass, the discrete divergence has to mimic the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_237">div u = 1 Œ¥V d dt (Œ¥V ) . (<label>6.9)</label></formula><p>On the other hand, by comparing (6.8) and (6.7), we conclude that to satisfy the geometric conservation law a discrete divergence operator has to be defined through a discrete analog of the following equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_238">div u = 1 Œ¥V ‚àÇ(Œ¥V (t)) u ‚Ä¢ n dS. (6.10)</formula><p>Hereafter, we refer to an operator having the property (6.10) as the operator given in the divergence form. Let us show that in the Cartesian coordinate system it is possible to define a discrete divergence operator that satisfies discrete analogs of both (6.10) and (6.9). The integral form of the conservation of momentum œÅu reads:</p><formula xml:id="formula_239">d dt V (t) œÅ u dV = - ‚àÇV (t)</formula><p>p n dS . <ref type="bibr">(6.11)</ref> Formally, it can be derived from the second equation in (6.1) by integrating it over V (t), applying the Reynolds transport theorem, and using the definition of the gradient operator</p><formula xml:id="formula_240">V (t) grad p dV = ‚àÇV (t)</formula><p>p n dS. (6.12)</p><p>The conservation of momentum follows from the divergence property of the gradient operator. The conservation of the total energy E = œÅ Œµ + |u| 2 /2 reads:</p><formula xml:id="formula_241">d dt V (t) œÅ |u| 2 2 + Œµ dV = - ‚àÇV (t) p (u ‚Ä¢ n) dS. (6.13)</formula><p>We can derive (6.13) by multiplying the momentum equation by u to obtain the rate of change of œÅ |u| 2 /2 and by adding the resulting equation to the internal energy equation, integrating over V (t), and using the duality property for the divergence and gradient operators:</p><formula xml:id="formula_242">V (t) grad p ‚Ä¢ u dV + V (t) p div u dV = ‚àÇV (t) p (u ‚Ä¢ n) dS.

Indeed, if we set u to the coordinate vectors (1, 0) and (0, 1) in (6.14) and take into account that the divergence of such vectors is zero, we obtain (6.12). If we set p = 1 and take into account that the gradient of a constant vector is zero, we obtain (6.10). Therefore, if the divergence is chosen as primary operator, it must be zero on constant vectors to provide the discrete conservation of momentum. If the gradient is chosen as primary operator, it must be zero on constant functions to guarantee the discrete geometric conservation law.

First, the normal vectors at the end points of an edge are different and on a polar mesh they coincide with the normal vectors to the corresponding circle. Then, the measures of two half-edges are different in the rz coordinate system. It is also important to note that the only difference in the definitions of the primary divergence operators in the Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems lies in the definition of the geometric elements such as areas and volumes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We described various mimetic finite difference (MFD) methods that have a common characteristics: they mimics important physical and mathematical properties of the underlying PDEs. These properties include conservation laws, symmetry and positivity of solutions, duality and self-adjointness of differential operators, and exact mathematical identities of vector and tensor calculus. The MFD methods are designed to preserve these properties on the unstructured polyhedral meshes that are often used in applications to represent complex static and moving models accurately.</p><p>We described two constructive frameworks based on distinct discrete vector and tensor calculuses (DVTCs) that lead to mimetic and compatible discretizations of a wide class of PDEs. The first framework is focused on the discretization of classical second-order PDEs in primal and mixed forms. The numerical construction produces discrete analogs of gradient, curl and divergence operators that satisfy exact mathematical identities and discrete Helmholtz decomposition theorems.</p><p>We presented the MFD methods for the elliptic PDEs appearing in diffusion, electromagnetics, linear elasticity and fluid mechanics problems, and we summarized their convergence properties. The flexibility of this framework has been illustrated by a few examples that include the development of high-order MFD methods, the stability analysis of saddle-point systems, and the enforcement of a discrete maximum principle.</p><p>The second framework is focused on the equations of the Lagrangian hydrodynamics where conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy is paramount, especially in the case of multiple coupled physical processes such as magneto-hydrodynamics. The numerical construction is based on subcell-forces that may have different physical meaning. Using artificial viscous forces, we illustrated how the discrete operators developed in the two frameworks can be used together. An extension of such framework to curvilinear meshes allowed us to build MFD methods that preserve the symmetry.</p><p>At the same time, we recognize that much work has to be done to complete the development and analysis of these frameworks. In particular, we want to extend the mimetic approach to the discretization of nonlinear PDEs. We also want to create a new mimetic theory that will include the discretization in time.

The selection is based on a special choice of the parameters that define the local inner product matrix M Q,c (where we recall that Q may be one of the discrete spaces N h , E h , F h , and C h ).   The numerical analogs of these properties, the discrete maximum principle (DMP) and the discrete monotonicity property, are among the most difficult properties to achieve in numerical methods, especially when the computational mesh is deformed to adapt and conform to the physical domain or the problem coefficients are highly heterogeneous and anisotropic. Violation of the DMP may lead to numerical instabilities such as oscillations and to nonphysical solutions such as heat flow from a cold material to a hot one.</p></div>

This switch ensures that the heating due to artificial viscosity occurs only for cells under compression. As described in subsection 3.3, an efficient method for calculating (6.44) builds matrix A h directly rather than calculating it as a product of two first-order operators. Recall that matrix A h represents a mimetic semi-inner product.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.8">Mimetic discretizations on curvilinear grids</head><p>In this subsection, we give one more example of a pair or a primary divergence and a derived gradient mimetic operators. These operators are constructed on curvilinear grids and are used to discretize the equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics in two-dimensional rz coordinates that preserve plane, cylindrical, and spherical symmetries. The presentation is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[196]</ref>.</p><p>The method developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[196]</ref> is formulated on a curvilinear mesh that is reconstructed from a given logically rectangular mesh, see Figure <ref type="figure">17</ref>. Thus, we relabeled the mesh nodes x n using two indices i and j. The edges in the reconstructed mesh are arcs of circles and straight segments. The latter can be treated as arcs of circle of infinite radius. The major property of the reconstructed mesh is that the normal vector to a curvilinear edge varies along it. In the presented discretization, only the normal vectors at the edge end-points are used. The mesh reconstruction algorithm introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[196]</ref> is exact for straight lines and circles, so that it does not change rectangular and polar grids. This is one of the main reasons why the mimetic discretization described below preserves various symmetries.</p><p>We use the self-explanatory notation shown on the right panel in Figure <ref type="figure">18</ref> that are more suitable for logically structured meshes. The nodes are labeled by i, j; the cells by i+1/2, j +1/2; the edges by i + 1/2, j and i, j + 1/2. The normal vectors at the edge end-points are labeled by the edge and node indices. The normal vectors are scaled by the length of the corresponding halfedges. According to the generic mimetic approach, we first define a primary discrete divergence operator, DIV : N 2 h ‚Üí C h , and then use it to derive a discrete gradient operator, GRAD :</p><p>The primary discrete divergence is based on (6.10) and reads as: + u i+1,j ‚Ä¢ S i+1/2,j i+1,j ) , <ref type="bibr">(6.45)</ref> where V i+1/2,j+1/2 is the volume of the cell with the curvilinear edges.</p></div>			</div>
