<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper investigates the problem of secure state estimation for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) modeled by continuous or discrete-time linear systems when some sensors are corrupted by an attacker. A novel state observer is proposed with adaptive switching mechanism. Attack tolerance principle is established based on adaptively truncating the injection channels of attacks. To implement it, a switching function matrix is introduced into the observer design. Driven by a well-defined performance index, the switching function matrix automatically reaches and remains in the desired entry mode and turns off the input channels of attacks. Based on the equivalence between s-strong detectability of the observation error system and 2ssparse detectability of the original system, the observation error system is proven to be asymptotically stable even under the cyber attacks. Compared with the existing complex static batch optimization algorithms, the proposed adaptive observer can be derived only by off-line solving a set of simple linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>With the fast development of science and technology, industrial applications are becoming complex and large. Largescale control systems are present everywhere to sustain the nominal operation of many critical process that we rely on. Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are a class of more complex large-scale systems, which integrate physical processes, computational resources, and communication capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, due to the embedded networked control technique, CPSs become more vulnerable and consequent cyber attacks have become one of the major threats to CPSs. Recently security related accidents indicate any successful attack may lead to significantly hamper the economy and endanger human lives, e.g., the Stuxnet storm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the Maroochy water bleach <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The importance of addressing the challenge of designing secure CPS has been acknowledged in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Security issues of CPSs subject to external attacks have received increasing attention in the past years. Many important approaches have been proposed to study the effects of specific type of attacks, such as deception attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and denial of service (DoS) attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Recently, the problem of state estimation has been widely studied under sparse sensor false data injection attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. For discrete-time linear systems, inspired from error correction and compressive sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> formulates the problem of secure state estimation into a static L r \L 1 , r &gt; 1 optimization problem. The reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> further extends the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and transforms the problem of state estimation into a static batch optimization (SBO) which can be solving by the customized gradient descent algorithms. For continuous-time linear systems, the reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposes two algorithms that permit the state reconstruction by utilizing the observability Gramian and the Luenberger observer in a multiple model setup. Although these proposed algorithms effectively recover the state, they can be computationally intensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and conservative for deriving convex conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In addition, these algorithms also have to be performed for the CPSs under attack-free conditions due to uncertain occurrence time of the attacks.</p><p>This paper develops a novel adaptive state observer for continuous or discrete-time linear CPSs with sparse sensor attacks, which works for the system under both normal and attacked conditions. Attack tolerance principle is established based on the direct idea that automatically truncating the injection channels of attacks. A switching function matrix is designed in the observer for searching all attacked sensors, and setting the corresponding output feedback signals to zero. It is shown that the observation error system is asymptotically stable regardless of the occurrence of attacks. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) Notions of sparse detectability and sparse strong detectability are introduced in this paper. It is shown that the s-sparse strong detectability of the observation error system is equivalent to that the original system is 2s-sparse detectable.</p><p>2) An adaptive switching mechanism is proposed rather than these SBO algorithms. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed observer are given in terms of only solving a set of simple linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Therefore, the computational complexity is significantly reduced.</p><p>3) Using an augmented system approach, it is proved that the observer converges to a neighborhood of the true system state in the presence of sparse attacks and bounded noise.</p><p>The notation used in this paper is standard. N + represents the sets of nonnegative integers. ℜ n denotes the n dimensional Euclidean space. C + represent the set of complex number with positive real part, respectively, and C+ = C + ∪ {0}. The notation ∥ • ∥ refers to the Euclidean vector norm. C s l represents the binomial coefficient, where l, s ∈ N + . For a set S, |S| denotes the cardinality of S. Denote by M S ∈ ℜ (p-s)×q the matrix obtained from M ∈ ℜ p×q by removing all the rows indexed by the set S. The support of a vector x ∈ ℜ l is denoted by supp(x), and x is s-sparse if |supp(x)| = s, where s ≤ l.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>Consider the following cyber-physical systems under attacks, which is described in continuous or discrete-time linear form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">δx(t) =Ax(t) + Bu(t) + w(t) y(t) =Cx(t) + a(t) + d(t) (1)</formula><p>where </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">δx(t) = ẋ(t</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">= {S ⊂ {1, 2, • • • , l} : |S| = s} = {S 2 , • • • , S C s l +1</formula><p>} the set of all sensor attack modes, and we use set S ξ to represent the ξth mode, ξ = 2, 3, • • • , C s l + 1. To be convenient, denote by a(t) = 0 the first attack mode S 1 . Since we are dealing with an adversarial agent, Assumption 1 indicates that the attack a(t) does not follow any particular model and we will simply take it to be arbitrary real numbers only if the bound restriction is satisfied. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> mentions that, Assumption 1 is practical. Due to the physical limitation of control units in a CPS such as power capacity, operation range, an attacker cannot inject arbitrarily large attack signals.</p><p>Definition 1. (Continuous-time) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> System (1) with w(t) = 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d(t) = 0 is strong* detectable if ∀a(t) ∈ ℜ l , y(t) → 0, t → ∞ implies x(t) → 0, t → ∞. Definition 2. (Discrete-time) [20] System (1) with w(t) = 0 and d(t) = 0 is strongly detectable if ∀a(t) ∈ ℜ l , y(t) → 0, t → ∞ implies x(t) → 0, t → ∞.</formula><p>From Definitions 1-2, the notion of strong detectability is proposed irrespective of arbitrary input a(t). This is conservative for system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> in the presence of s-sparse attacks. This motivates the following definition of "strong detectability under sparse attacks". Definition 3. (Continuous-time) System (1) with w(t) = 0 and d(t) = 0 is s-sparse strong* detectable if for any s-sparse vector a(t) ∈ ℜ l ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y(t) → 0, t → ∞ implies x(t) → 0, t → ∞.</formula><p>Definition 4. (Discrete-time) System (1) with w(t) = 0 and d(t) = 0 is s-sparse strongly detectable if for any s-sparse vector a(t) ∈ ℜ l ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y(t) → 0, t → ∞ implies x(t) → 0, t → ∞.</formula><p>Similar to the s-sparse observability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we introduce the notion of s-sparse detectability, which is a weaker property than s-sparse observability.</p><p>Definition 5. System (1) is s-sparse detectable if for every set S ⊂ {1, • • • , l} with |S| = s (s ≤ l), the pair (A, C S ) is detectable.</p><p>Based on Definition 5, we have the following assumption. Assumption 2. System (1) is 2s-sparse detectable.</p><p>In this paper, the objective is to design a state observer for system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> in the presence of sensor attacks, such that the observer asymptotically converges to the true system state in the absence of additive noise, or to a neighborhood of the true system state under both normal and attacked conditions in the presence of bounded noise.</p><p>Motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the attack tolerance principle is established based on automatically truncating the injection channels of attacks. We will introduce an adaptive switching mechanism to search for attacked sensors and remove tampered feedback signals.</p><p>Remark 1. The considered problem is closely related to fault estimation. However, the literature on <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> typically rely on prior knowledge of the failure models and time evolution of failures, which is generally not available in the context of adversarial attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MAIN RESULTS</head><p>In this section, an adaptive observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states. The corresponding observer gains can be derived by solving a set of simple LMIs. Since the malicious agent intends to inject some cheated information into some sensors to disrupt the estimation performance, it is critical for the observer design to build a switching mechanism to turn off the entries that corrupted measurement signals feed back into the observation. Thereafter, an automatic mechanism has to be developed to locate unknown attack mode S ξ ∈ S and resultantly eliminate influence of the sensor attacks. To implement these, we first define the switching function matrix R ξ(t) = diag{r 1 (ξ(t)), • • • , r l (ξ(t))}, and then the following definition is given. Definition 6. For the ξth attack mode S ξ , ξ = 1, 2, • • • , C s l + 1, the desired switching function matrix is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">R ξ = diag{r 1 (ξ), • • • , r l (ξ)} where r i (ξ) = 0 for i ∈ S ξ , otherwise 1, i = 1, 2, • • • , l. Further, denote by R = {R ξ , ξ = 1, • • • , C s l + 1}</formula><p>the set of all desired switching function matrices.</p><p>According to Definition 1, one has R ξ a = 0 for supp(a) = S ξ , which shows that the proper entry mode can be chosen by the switching function matrix. However, the real attack mode S ξ * is unknown, and therefore how to identify the attack mode ξ * is the main difficulty for state observer design.</p><p>Next, let us focus on the design of the adaptive observer, which is in the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">δ x =Ax + Bu + L ξ R ξ (y -ŷ) ŷ =C x<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where x and ŷ are the state and output, respectively; L ξ , ξ = 1, • • • , C s l + 1 are the observer gains to be determined. Denote the error vector e = x-x, e y = R ξ (y-ŷ). Combing (1) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">2</ref>), the observation error system is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">δe = (A -L ξ R ξ C)e -L ξ R ξ a + w ′ e y = R ξ Ce + R ξ a + d ′ (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">w ′ = w -L ξ R ξ d and d ′ = R ξ d are bounded by ϖ = w + ∥L ξ ∥ d and d, respectively.</formula><p>In order to identify the attack mode, an adaptive switching mechanism is implemented. Define the observed performance index θ as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Dθ = µN 2 ϵ (e y ) =: { 0, ∥e y ∥ ≤ ϵ µ(∥e y ∥ -ϵ) 2 , ∥e y ∥ &gt; ϵ (4)</formula><p>where D denotes time-derivative (t ∈ ℜ) or forward difference operator (t ∈ N + ); µ and ϵ are constants to be determined. It is seen that N 2 ϵ (•) is a smooth "dead-zone" type function. Then the switching logic is designed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ξ(θ) = ⌈mod(θ, C s l + 1)⌉<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where ⌈•⌉ is the ceiling function, and mod(•, •) is the residual operator or known as the modulus.</p><p>In fact, the switching function R ξ(t) is a matrix selector that picks a candidate R ξ from R by observing the performance index θ in (4). In this manner, R ξ(t) can vary from R 1 to R C s l +1 continuously, and hence provides an automatic scheme to eventually locate the proper entry mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Continuous-time systems</head><p>To show the effectiveness of observer (2) for system (1) under Assumption 2, the following lemma is required.</p><p>Lemma 1. (Continuous-time) Under the conditions w(t) = 0 and d(t) = 0, error system (3) is s-sparse strong* detectable if and only if system (1) is 2s-sparse detectable.</p><p>Proof: Assume that the adversary has launched the ξ * th attack mode, and then R ξ * a = 0.

Then (10) holds if and only if (A, R ξ * R ξ C) for any ξ, ξ * ∈ {1, 2, • • • , C s l + 1} is detectable, from Definition 5, which is equivalent to that system (3) is 2s-sparse detectable.</formula><p>To make analysis on the stability of system (3), the following Lyaounov function candidate is taken</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">V = e T P ξ e (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where P ξ is the Lyapunov matrix to be designed.

The observer gain L ξ is designed as L ξ = P -1 ξ N ξ . Proof. Now, we shall consider system (3) with three scenarios.

It means that the corrupted measurement signal y i , i ∈ S ξ * is not feedback for state estimation, i.e., R ξ * a = 0.

According to switching logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, it is expected that there exists a time t * , the R ξ is switched to the right entry mode and the following inequality is satisfied</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">∫ +∞ t * θ(t)dt ≤ 1<label>(15)</label></formula><p>For 0 ≤ t &lt; t * , by using Assumption 1 and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">12</ref>), one has</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">V =2e T Pξ(A -LξRξC)e -2e T PξLξRξa + 2e T Pξw ′ ≤ -αV + 2e T PξLξRξa + η 2 ϖ 2 ≤ - 1 2 αV + 2λD 2 α + η 2 ϖ 2<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">λ = max{∥R ξ L T ξ P ξ L ξ R ξ ∥, ξ = 1, 2, • • • , C s l + 1}.

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, a switched Luenberger observer with a finite-time Gramian-based estimator is proposed in a multiple model setup. Such an algorithm is NP-hard in general and computationally intensive. They need to run C s p +C 2s p estimator candidates simultaneously so that the required memory size is O(C s p ) for each time step. In this paper, a novel adaptive switching mechanism is introduced into the observer design. This mechanism can automatically search for the sensor attack mode only by computing online the adaptive law (4). The memory size of the controller is O <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Therefore, the computation burden and required memory space are both significantly reduced.</p></div>

It implies that lim t→∞ ∥e y (t)∥ ≤ ϵ. Furthermore, when w = 0 and d = 0, we obtain e y (t) → 0 as t → ∞. From Lemma 2, one has lim t→∞ e(t) = 0.</p><p>To evaluate the state estimate error e(t) under the noise, define ỹ = I S ξ y and ŷ = I S ξ ŷ.

A too small µ will cause a slow convergence rate and a poor performance because the switching rate ξ is slow from Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>). However, the computation of the M , M 1 and M 2 may be conservative in the above procedure. To achieve a better observation performance, we modify the design parameter µ as the time-varying one, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">µ(t) = { µ 0 , (κθ(t) + γ) -1 &lt; µ 0 (κθ(t) + γ) -1 , otherwise<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where κ &gt; 0 and γ &gt; 0 are design parameters, and 1/γ &gt; µ 0 . Obviously, if t * is sufficiently big, that is, θ is sufficiently big, then µ = µ 0 , which guarantees Theorems 1-2 still hold. On the other hand, a more appropriate µ(&gt; µ 0 ) can be found easily due to the special form (25). Remark 4. From the above analysis, it is easy to see that the proposed adaptive observer can also tolerate the case that the number of attacked sensors is less than s. In this case, the desired switching function matrix could be more than one.</p><p>Remark 5. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the secure state estimation methods are proposed for discrete-time linear systems. However, due to use of the SBO, these results are computationally intensive and conservative for deriving convex conditions. What's more, they cannot guarantee real time estimation. In this paper, we construct a novel state observer by using adaptive switching mechanism rather than the static algorithms. The computational complexity only involves to solving off-line a set of LMIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and computing online an adaptive law (4). The system state can also be well estimated in real time. (Continuous-time) Consider the IEEE 6 bus power system with 3 generators and 6 buses in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Using the small signal method, a Kronreduced form of the power network is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>:</p><p>[ δ(t)</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">M g ω(t) ] = [ 0 I -Lgg + L g1 L -1 11 L 1g -D g ] [ δ(t) ω(t) ] + [ 0 0 I -L g1 L -1 11 ] [ P ω (t) -ω d (t)D g P θ ]<label>(26)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">δ(t) = [δ 1 (t), δ 2 (t), δ 3 (t)] T and ω(t) = [ω 1 (t), ω 2 (t),<label>ω 3 (t)</label></formula><p>] T denote the generator rotor angles and frequencies.</p><p>The matrices M g and D g are diagonal matrices of the generator inertial and damping coefficients, and the inputs P ω = [P ω1 , P ω2 , P ω3 ] T and P θ = [P θ1 , P θ2 , P θ3 ] T are the controlled mechanical power input power and real power demand at the loads. To address the secure state estimation problem against cyber attack, denote u(t) = P ω (t)-L g1 L -1 11 P θ (t)-ω(t)D g as the equivalent input. Suppose that the sensors measure directly the frequencies of the three generators. Then the power system under cyber attack can be expressed into form in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">A = [ 0 I -M -1 g (L g1 L -1 11 L 1g -Lgg) -M -1 g D g ] , B = [ 0 M -1 g ] T , C = [ 0 3 I 3 ] .</formula><p>The system matrices are set as M g = diag{0.125, 0.034, 0.016}, D g = diag{0.125, 0.068, 0.48} and (see the top of the next page).</p><p>In the simulation, assume that the second sensor is attacked, and set D = 50. It is easy to verify that Assumptions 1 and 2 are both satisfied. The initial state condition is set as [0.2 -0.5 0.7 0 0 0] T , and other initial conditions are set as 0. The process noise and the measurement noise are set as w(t) = 0.02 sin t and d(t) = 0.01 cos t, respectively. By computation, the set of the overall switching matrices is obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">R = {R 1 , • • • , R 4 } = {diag{1, 1, 1}, diag{0, 1, 1}, diag{1, 0, 1}, diag{1, 1, 0}}.</formula><p>Choose the design parameters κ = 0.1 and γ = 0.45. By solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> with α = 0.5, the observer gain matrices are obtained as      The system and observer states are demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Clearly the adaptive observer can estimate the system state well regardless of the adversarial attacks. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> plots the attack signal a 2 (t) and its estimate êy2 (t) and the corresponding estimate error. The adaptive switching mechanism is summarized as follow. The second sensor suffers attack at t = 10s. Since a wrong mode is chosen and the cyber attack is injured into observer dynamic successfully, the observation performance is degraded at once. Thus, the performance indexes θ grow rapidly, which drives the index ξ to switch to the next entry mode, until ξ reaches 3, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. It corresponds to the desired mode R 3 = diag{1, 0, 1}. The input channel of cyber attacks is turned off, and the remaining healthy sensors can still achieve a good observation performance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">[ L gg L g1 L g1 L 11 ] =       0.</formula><p>To show the observation performance and computational efficiency of the proposed method, the comparative results between the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and the method in this paper are given in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Two observers are implemented by using Simulink where the ode45 solver is used with "Max step size" setting 0.01 and other parameters acquiescent.

However in the proposed method, the high spike in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> arises during the switching phase due to the fact that the attack signal is injected successfully. The execution time 1 versus these methods with different simulation time is presented in Fig 6 . Clearly the proposed method in this paper requires less execution time.</p><p>Example 2. (Discrete-time) Consider an aircraft system which is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. By taking periodic sampling with sampling period h = 0.1s, a discretized model as system (1) can be obtained with the parameters To guarantee the sparse observability of system, the output variables are set as forward velocity, angle of attack, pitch rate and pitch attitude angle, then C = [I 4 , 0 4×2 ]. Assume that only one sensor is attacked. By solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> with β = 0.2, the observer gains L i , i = 1, • • • , 5 can be obtained and omitted here for saving space. The other design parameters are set as κ = 1 and γ = 45. In the simulation, assume that the second sensor is attacked at 1 The execution time is taken as the average value of the execution time by performing 100 tests for given simulation time.    For comparison, we intend to apply the L 1 /L 2 decoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and the event-triggered projected gradient descent (ETPG) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, by computing, one obtains δ 2s /λ max (Q T Q) = 1.9142 × 10 -11 /15.2820 = 1.2526 × 10 -12 &lt;&lt; 4/9 where Q = [O I] and δ 2s is defined in the Proposition 3.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, O is the observability matrix. It means that the convergence condition in the Theorem 4.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is not satisfied. Therefore, the ETPG algorithm cannot be applied. The L 1 /L 2 decoder is implemented using CVX while the proposed method is implemented by using the Simulink and LMI toolboxes in Matlab. The simulation results are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. It is seen that the discrete-time adaptive observer works well under both normal and attacked conditions. However, the L 1 /L 2 decoder becomes invalid after the attack occurs and the execution time is longer than that of the proposed method.  ]</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">A =   0.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_66">,</formula><p>where A and B are borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and C is a matrix where each element is randomly generated from the interval <ref type="bibr">[-10, 10]</ref>.
