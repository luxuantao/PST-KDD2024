<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We introduce a new class of algebras called EQ-algebras. An EQ-algebra has three basic binary operations (meet, multiplication and a fuzzy equality) and a top element. These algebras are intended to become algebras of truth values for a higher-order fuzzy logic (a fuzzy type theory, FTT). The motivation stems from the fact that until now, the truth values in FTT were assumed to form either an IMTL-, BL-, or MV-algebra, all of them being special kinds of residuated lattices in which the basic operations are the monoidal operation (multiplication) and its residuum. The latter is a natural interpretation of implication in fuzzy logic; the equivalence is then interpreted by the biresiduum, a derived operation. The basic connective in FTT, however, is a fuzzy equality and, therefore, it is not natural to interpret it by a derived operation. This defect is expected to be removed by the class of EQ-algebras introduced and studied in this paper. From the algebraic point of view, the class of EQ-algebras generalizes, in a certain sense, the class of residuated lattices and so, they may become an interesting class of algebraic structures as such.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Every many-valued logic is uniquely determined by the algebraic properties of the structure of its truth values. Nowadays, it is generally accepted that in fuzzy logic this algebraic structure should be a residuated lattice, possibly fulfilling some additional properties.</p><p>This idea was initiated by Goguen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Its formal elaboration was advanced considerably by Pavelka <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, who developed the first very general formal system of fuzzy logic. 1 It is only since 1998, after the publication of the book of Hájek <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, that fuzzy logic is being developed as a class of various formal systems, 2 each of them based on some specific kind of residuated lattice. It is important to note that all these systems have a traditional syntax (unlike the logic of Pavelka whose syntax is evaluated), which is complete w.r.t. the semantics based on the variety of the corresponding algebras.</p><p>In all of the above-mentioned cases, both propositional as well as first-order logics have been developed. A natural question thus arises whether also a higher-order fuzzy logic can be developed as a counterpart of the classical higher-order logic (type theory, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). This question has been answered positively in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> with the introduction of fuzzy type theory (FTT). The algebra of truth values considered was again a residuated lattice, namely an IMTLalgebra, which is a bounded commutative integral residuated lattice fulfilling the prelinearity and double negation properties and endowed with an additional unary operation . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, other kinds of FTT have been introduced, where the algebra of truth values is either a Łukasiewicz , a BL , or a Ł -algebra (for a detailed study of these algebras, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>).</p><p>Let us now recall the general way how logical systems are established given some algebra of truth values: first, their syntax is defined, which includes, besides others, a set of basic connectives. Each of the connectives is chosen in such a way to correspond with a basic operation of the underlying algebra. This enables to define semantics by assigning truth values to formulas so that each truth value can be computed using algebraic operations of the chosen algebra.</p><p>In FTT, however, the situation is rather specific since it is established as a generalization of the elegant classical formal system introduced by A. Church and continued by Henkin and Andrews. Namely, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> Henkin developed a formalism of type theory with equality (identity) representing equality between various kinds of objects as a sole basic connective. This theory is also described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Hence, it is challenging to develop a fuzzy type theory whose basic connective would be a fuzzy equality. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> In residuated lattices, however, the basic operations are the following: join, meet, a monoidal operation (multiplication) and its residuum (denoted by ⇒). In fuzzy logic, the latter is a semantic interpretation of the implication. The (logical) equivalence is then interpreted by the biresiduum a ⇔ b = (a ⇒ b) ∧ (b ⇒ a), which is a derived operation. Thus, we face a conceptual discrepancy: a basic connective is semantically interpreted by a derived operation. We may thus wonder whether an algebra of truth values specific for FTT can be introduced. One possibility is to extend an MV-algebra by a similarity (fuzzy equality) as proposed by Gerla and Leuştean <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This approach, however, is still somewhat artificial and, therefore, not fully satisfactory.</p><p>The corresponding algebra should express certain fundamental properties of fuzzy equality and, at the same time, be able to serve as an algebra of truth values, i.e. it must be ordered and provide the implication. A preliminary version of such an algebra was presented for the first time in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and called EQ-algebra. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">4</ref>A challenging question from the very beginning was whether EQ-algebras differ from residuated lattices or only are a reformulation being term-equivalent to the latter; and if they differ, whether they play any role in fuzzy logic where the position of residuated lattices seems to be unshakable. After having studied them for some years now, we are convinced of a positive answer. Indeed, EQ-algebras generalize residuated lattices because they relax the tie between multiplication and residuation (i.e. between conjunction and implication in logic); the implication is defined from the fuzzy equality ∼ by the formula a → b = (a ∧ b) ∼ a. Because this equation holds also for the biresiduum, each residuated lattice can be seen as an EQ-algebra but not vice versa. At the same time, after checking properties of the implication in relation with the already developed fuzzy type theory based on EQ-algebras <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, we conclude that it preserves all essential ones (including, e.g., the exchange principle and the modus ponens). Let us stress, however, that there are EQ-algebras with the same implication but different fuzzy equalities, i.e. the fuzzy equality, in general, cannot be reconstructed from the implication (in special cases, of course, this is possible, for example in all linearly ordered EQ-algebras).</p><p>One of the outcomes is the possibility to relax the commutativity of the multiplication without inducing two different residuation operations as is the case in pseudo-residuated lattices. This has been elaborated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and opens an exciting possibility to develop a fuzzy logic with a non-commutative conjunction but a single implication only. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref>In the present paper, which is an extension of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the study of EQ-algebras will be further deepened. Note that the axioms originally introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> have been slightly modified. We tried to specify the EQ-algebra axioms to capture the essence of the fuzzy equality and so, from the point of view of the requirements of fuzzy logic (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>), they are more general. On the other hand, this class of algebras is quite interesting in itself and rich enough to attract interest of mathematicians.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we mainly recall some well-known, but essential properties of residuated lattices. EQ-algebras are introduced in Section 3, some derived operations are defined and their properties are extensively studied. In Section 4, we present several examples of EQ-algebras, including generic ones based on residuated lattices, as well as examples of finite ones. Section 5 illustrates how all pieces fit perfectly together from the point of view of fuzzy equalities and fuzzy orderings. In the seventies the related concept of an equivalential algebra has been introduced, where equivalence is also the basic algebraic operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Therefore, we consider it necessary to discuss the connection with EQ-algebras. In Section 6, we will show that both structures are quite different. Section 7 is dedicated to the study of filters of EQ-algebras. Finally, in Section 8, we discuss some special classes of EQ-algebras and their properties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Definition and fundamental properties of EQ-algebras</head><p>In this section, we present the definition of an EQ-algebra and some basic properties of it. Definition 1. A (commutative) EQ-algebra E is an algebra of type (2, 2, 2, 0), i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">E = E, ∧, ⊗, ∼, 1 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where for all a, b, c, d ∈ E: </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(E1) E, ∧,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">∧ b = a), (E3) a ∼ a = 1, (E4) ((a ∧ b) ∼ c) ⊗ (d ∼ a) ≤ c ∼ (d ∧ b), (E5) (a ∼ b) ⊗ (c ∼ d) ≤ (a ∼ c) ∼ (b ∼ d), (E6) (a ∧ b ∧ c) ∼ a ≤ (a ∧ b) ∼ a, (E7) (a ∧ b) ∼ a ≤ (a ∧ b ∧ c) ∼ (a ∧ c), (E8) a ⊗ b ≤ a ∼ b.</formula><p>The operation ∧ is called meet (infimum) and the operation ⊗ is called multiplication. As will be shown further on, ∼ is a fuzzy equality.</p><p>Axiom (E3) expresses reflexivity, (E4) is the substitution axiom, (E5) is the congruence axiom, (E6) and (E7) are monotonicity axioms (see also the alternative formulations (E6 ) and (E7 ) below) and (E8) is the axiom of boundedness.</p><p>Axiom (E4) is motivated by the substitution principle formulated already by G.W. Leibniz: "if A equals B then A can be replaced by B wherever A occurs". Since the ordering is essential in an EQ-algebra, this axiom is formulated w.r.t. ∧ only. Note that the substitution axiom can also be seen as a special form of extensionality (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). As will be seen in Theorem 1, it allows to prove the transitivity property of ∼. The congruence axiom naturally generalizes the following property of the classical equality: if a = b and c = d, then the truth of a = c is the same as the truth of b = d. The role of ⊗ is auxiliary and is used solely for fusion of values.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Equivalential algebras</head><p>In this section, we explore the seemingly related notion of an equivalential algebra, introduced by Kabzinński and Wroński as early as 1975 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and studied in detail also recently by Slomczyńska <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The underlying idea is very similar to that of EQ-algebras, since the basic operation is a binary symmetric operation which corresponds to the biresiduation operation in Heyting algebras. However, our goal is not only to study some new interesting algebra, but to develop the algebraic background for higher-order fuzzy logics. As this section will show, it turns out that EQ-algebras are more general than equivalential algebras. Definition 3. An equivalential algebra is an algebra A = A, • with a single binary operation "•" (equivalence) fulfilling the following axioms for all x, y, z ∈ A:</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">(i) (x • x) • y = y, (ii) ((x • y) • z) • z = (x • z) • (y • z), (iii) (((x • y) • ((x • z) • z)) • ((x • z) • z)) = x • y.</formula><p>A typical example of an equivalential algebra is an algebra induced by a Heyting algebra. Formally, if E = E, ∧, ∨, ∧, ⇒, 0, 1 is a Heyting algebra (considered as a residuated lattice), then A = E, ⇔ is an equivalential algebra, with ⇔ the corresponding biresiduation operation. Since any Gödel algebra is a Heyting algebra, any Gödel algebra is also an equivalential algebra. Recall that Gödel algebras are the algebraic counterpart of Gödel logics, which belong to the group of fuzzy logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>However, not all algebraic counterparts of fuzzy logics are equivalential algebras. MV-algebras are the algebraic counterpart of Łukasiewicz logics, which occupy a prominent place. Recall that a residuated lattice is an</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">MV-algebra if (a → b) → b = (b → a) → a, for all a, b ∈ E.</formula><p>For more information on MV-algebras, we refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Proposition 4. Let L = L , ∨, ∧, ⊗, ⇒, 0, 1 be an MV-algebra with |L| &gt; 2 and ⇔ be the corresponding biresiduum. Then L , ⇔ is not an equivalential algebra.</p><p>Proof. On account of Theorem 2.5.3 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, an equation holds in every MV-algebra if and only if it holds in the standard Łukasiewicz MV-algebra. Let us consider x = 0.7, y = 0.4 and z = 0.6. It is easily verified that axiom (ii) of Definition 3 is not satisfied. Indeed, the left-hand side evaluates to 0.7, while the right-hand side yields 0.9. ç Corollary 1. Let L be the standard Łukasiewicz MV-algebra and ⇔ be the corresponding biresiduation operation. Then L , ⇔ is not an equivalential algebra. Proposition 5. Consider an EQ-algebra E = E, ∧, ⊗, ∼, 1 that contains an element z such that z ∼ z 1. Then E, ∼ is not an equivalential algebra.</p><p>Proof. It suffices to consider x = y in axiom (ii) of Definition 3. The left-hand reduces to z ∼ z, while the right-hand side yields 1. ç From the above results we conclude that equivalential algebras are particular objects of marginal interest to the study of fuzzy logics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Filters in EQ-algebras</head><p>In this section, we will introduce the concept of an EQ-filter and provide a few basic facts. The filter and congruence theory of EQ-algebras is rather subtle and requires still more investigation. Various other results can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. As emphasized before, EQ-algebras behave differently than residuated lattices, as is illustrated by the fact that a → b = 1 does not imply that a ≤ b. Not surprisingly then, the study of filters require proper care, especially related to the behavior of ∼ w.r.t. ⊗. Definition 4. Let E = E, ∧, ⊗, ∼, 1 be an EQ-algebra.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have introduced the concept of an EQ-algebra, which should become the algebra of truth values for fuzzy type theory. Its main operation is a fuzzy equality ∼ (a natural interpretation of the main connective in fuzzy type theory) accompanied by the binary operations of meet and multiplication (⊗). The essential difference between residuated lattices and EQ-algebras lies in the definition of implication →. Unlike residuated lattices, where → is joined with ⊗ through the adjointness property, in EQ-algebras → is defined directly from the fuzzy equality ∼. Hence, the adjointness property which strictly couples → and ⊗, is relaxed. This has as consequence that the multiplication can be non-commutative without forcing two kinds of implication. In this paper, we have studied basic properties of commutative EQ-algebras (i.e. the multiplication ⊗ is commutative) and presented several special kinds of EQ-algebras.</p><p>The relation between EQ-algebras and residuated lattices is quite intricate and it seems that the former opened the door to another look at the latter. When considering implication only, it can be shown that the corresponding reduct of EQ-algebras are BCK-algebras (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>) and so, residuated lattices are "hidden" inside. On the other hand, EQ-algebras form a variety and, as has been demonstrated, they are not equivalent with residuated lattices. We will focus more closely on this relation in subsequent papers.</p><p>Finally, let us remark that EQ-algebras opened the door also to introducing a class of EQ-logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> which might cast a different light on fuzzy logics studied until now only from the point of view of the properties of implication (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). However, the idea to develop a logic on the basis of identity (equality) as the principal connective attracted such thinkers as G.W. Leibnitz, L. Wittgenstein and F.P. Ramsey (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>). For example, G.W. Leibnitz proclaimed that "a fully satisfactory logical calculus must be an equational one" (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). One of the recent works where an "equational" approach to classical logic is established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. All of this can be considered as additional support for EQ-algebras.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>(Lemma 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>açb) ⊗ (bçc) ≤ açc, for all a, b, c ∈ L and ç ∈ {⇔, • ⇔}.

Proof. The implication (a) ⇒ (b) follows from Lemma 4(g). Applying Lemma 4(b) and the isotonicity of ⊗ on a ⊗ (a ∼ b) ≤ a ⊗ (a → b) ≤ b, leads to (b) ⇒ (c). For the implication (c) ⇒ (a), we first observe that Lemma 4(b) and the isotonicity of ⊗ lead to the inequality b= 1 ⊗ (1 ∼ b) ≤ 1 ⊗ (1 → b) ≤ b.Lemma 4(e) then implies that b = b and hence, E is good. ç Lemma 13. Let E be an EQ-algebra. The following statements are equivalent:(a) E is residuated, (b) E is separated and for all a, b, c ∈ E it holds that (a ⊗ b) → c = a → (b → c), (c) E is good and for all a, b ∈ E it holds that a ≤ b → a(⊗b).Proof. (a) ⇒ (b): since a → b ≤ a → b, the residuation property implies that a ⊗ (a → b) ≤ b. It then follows from Lemma 12 that L is good, and subsequently from Lemma 11(f) that L is separated. According to Lemma 12(c), it then holds that a ⊗ (a → (b → c)) ≤ b → c. The residuation property then implies that (a ⊗ b) ⊗ (a → (b → c)) ≤ c, and also a → (b → c) ≤ (a ⊗ b) → c. Again applying Lemma 12(c), it holds that (a ⊗ b) ⊗ ((a ⊗ b) → c) ≤ c, or equivalently, due to the commutativity and associativity of ⊗, b ⊗ (a ⊗ ((a ⊗ b) → c) ≤ c. The residuation property then leads to (a ⊗ b) → c ≤ a → (b → c). (b) ⇒ (a): we can rewrite the equality as follows: (a ⊗ b) ∧ c ∼ a ⊗ b = a ∧ ((b ∧ c) ∼ b) ∼ a. If (a ⊗ b) ∧ c = a ⊗ b then Lemma 4(d) implies that (a ⊗ b) ∧ c ∼ a ⊗ b = 1, and hence, since E is separated, (a ⊗ b) ∧ c = a ⊗ b. The converse implication can be proved in the same way and hence, we conclude that E is residuated. (a) ⇒ (c): from a ⊗ b ≤ a ⊗ b, the residuation property yields a ≤ b → a ⊗ b. (c) ⇒ (a): let a ⊗ b ≤ c. Based on the assumption and Lemma 3(d), we have a ≤ b → (a ⊗ b) ≤ b → c. Since E is good, the converse implication follows from Proposition 1 and hence, E is residuated. ç An example of a non-residuated EQ-algebra can be obtained from Example 3(b) by taking * strictly smaller than ⊗, i.e. there exist a, b, c ∈ E such that a * b ≤ c &lt; a ⊗ b.

It is based on pseudo BL-algebras and its main drawback is the necessity to consider two implications arising immediately from two sides of the adjointness property. However, we can hardly find an interpretation for them and, for instance, a special inference rule is necessary to derive one implication from the other one.</p></note>
