<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE problem of filtering for linear discrete-time state- state models has been the subject of extensive research over the past decade; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and references therein. In filtering, the noise sources are arbitrary deterministic signals with bounded energy, or average power, and a filter is sought which ensures a prescribed upper bound on the -induced gain from the noise signals to the estimation error. This filtering approach is very appropriate to applications where the statistics of the noise signals are not exactly known.</p><p>In the past few years, considerable interest has been devoted to the problem of robust filters for uncertain linear discrete-time systems, namely, the design of filters with a guaranteed performance for linear discrete-time state-space models with significant parameter uncertainty. In the case of norm-bounded parameter uncertainty, robust filters have been developed using either a Riccati equation approach (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>), or linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. On the other hand, linear discrete-time state-space models with polytopic-type parameter uncertainty have been recently treated in, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> using an LMI methodology.</p><p>With exception of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the aforementioned robust filtering methods have the feature of being based on the notion of quadratic stability, namely, a Lyapunov function, independent of the uncertain parameters, is used to guarantee stability and performance properties for all admissible parameters. This approach is numerically appealing; however, it can be quite conservative as the Lyapunov function is parameter independent. Moreover, stability and performance hold even when the parameters change arbitrarily fast, which entails an overdesign for many applications. An alternative to reduce the conservatism of the quadratic stability methods is to use a Lyapunov function which depends on the uncertain parameters, referred to as parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, which has been introduced for robust control design. Very recently, robust filters based on parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions have been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for discrete-time linear systems with polytopic-type parameter uncertainty. These works are, however, restricted to the case of time-invariant parameters, and the Lyapunov functions are affine in the parameters.</p><p>This paper, which is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, considers the problem of robust filtering for linear discrete-time state-space models subject to uncertain time-varying parameters that enter affinely into the state-space model matrices. The parameters value and variation are unknown; however, they are assumed to be constrained to given intervals. The problem addressed is the design of a linear stationary asymptotically stable filter with a prescribed upper bound on the -gain from the noise signals to the estimation error for all admissible uncertain parameters. The proposed robust filter design is based on a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function with quadratic dependence on the uncertain parameters and is given in terms of a standard LMI problem, which can be numerically solved very efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The motivation for using a quadratic parameter-dependent Lyapunov function is that it allows for achieving better performance than the affine one, in particular, in the case of time-varying parameters, as shown by the example in Section IV. The new filtering method incorporates information on available bounds on the variation of the uncertain parameters and is less conservative than those based on quadratic stability. In particular, it includes the quadratic stability approach as a special case.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the signal model used in the paper, the problem statement, and some preliminary results. Section III addresses the robust filter design. A numerical example is presented in Section IV to demonstrate the potentials of the proposed filter design. Conclusions are drawn in Section V.</p><p>Notation: denotes the -dimensional Euclidean space, is the set of real matrices, and are the and zero matrices, is the identity matrix, and denotes a block-diagonal matrix.

SYSTEM DEFINITION AND PRELIMINARIES</head><p>Consider the uncertain linear discrete-time system</p><p>(1) with , where is the state, is the noise signal (including process and measurement noises), which is assumed to be an arbitrary signal in , is the measurement, is the signal to be estimated, , , are bounded timevarying uncertain parameters with bounded variation , and , , , , , and are real matrices of appropriate dimensions that depend affinely on the parameter vector . Moreover, let . In the case where the noise signals affecting the state, measurement, and signal appear differently in the equations, say, , and , respectively, we can simply let , , , and in the state-space model .</p><p>It is assumed that the uncertain parameters and their variation , for and at each time instant, are such that and , where , and , are known extremal values of and , respectively. In addition, let be a polytope representing the set of admissible values of pairs . Note that the vertices of can be obtained from the scalars , , and . It should be observed that the values of 1 depend on the values of and . Throughout this paper it is assumed that the admissible values of are invariant with respect to , and thus are the same as the admissible values of 1 . This implies that the admissible values of are such that the constraint holds. A polytope will be referred to as a consistent polytope if the constraints , , and hold for , i.e., if , then also belongs to .</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>(a) shows, for the case of a scalar , a polytope which is not consistent as, for instance, if and , then 1 will be outside . A nonconsistent polytope contains pairs that will never occur, which may lead to conservative results. On the other hand, the polytope of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(b</ref>) is consistent when and . Note that when , then can change from one extreme of the admissible range to the other in one time-step, which corresponds to the largest possible parameter variation. In this case, is said to be a consistent polytope of maximum variation. Observe that, in the general case where is a vector, for each , , we define a consistent polytope as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(b</ref>). Then a consistent polytope can be determined as the polytope with vertices obtained by the cartesian product of the vertices of . It should be remarked that a consistent polytope must include as admissible value for . This paper is aimed at obtaining an estimate of with a small estimation error, in the worst case noise effect sense, over the entire polytope . Attention is focused on the design of a linear discrete time-invariant, asymptotically stable, filter of order with state-space realization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where the matrices , , , and are to be determined. Considering (1) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), the dynamics of the estimation error can be described by the following state-space model:</p><p>(3) where</p><p>The filtering problem addressed in this paper is as follows. Given a scalar , find an asymptotically stable filter such that the estimation error system is exponentially stable and its -induced gain, i.e., norm, defined by satisfies for all admissible trajectories of and in . Inspired by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> on robust stability analysis of linear systems with uncertain time-varying parameters via parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions, this paper develops an LMI methodology of robust filtering based on a Lyapunov function with quadratic dependence on .</p><p>We conclude this section by recalling some intermediate results which will be used in the derivation of the filter design of this paper.</p><p>Lemma Note that the conditions of (5) remain sufficient for (4) to hold even when arbitrary constraints are imposed to the scaling matrices , including setting , .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ROBUST FILTERING</head><p>We first recall a version of the bounded real lemma (BRL) for discrete linear time-varying systems. To this end, let the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where is the state, is the input, is output, and , , , and are bounded real-valued matrix sequences with appropriate dimensions.</p><p>The following LMI-based BRL can be readily derived from a result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 3: Consider system and let be a given scalar. If there exists a bounded matrix sequence satisfying the following inequality for , <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> then system is exponentially stable and . Next, we present an alternative characterization of the norm in which the products and are replaced by and , respectively, where is a slack matrix variable. The advantages of introducing the overparameterization matrix were first unveiled in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> in the context of robust stability of linear discrete time-invariant systems. The novelty here is that the result is stated in the more general context of time-varying systems, allowing for Lyapunov functions dependent on time-varying parameters. This characterization of the norm will be fundamental in the derivation of the robust filter design method proposed in this paper. Theorem 1: Consider system and let be a given scalar. Then, there exists a bounded matrix sequence satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> if and only if there exist bounded matrix sequences and such that for the same (8) Proof-Necessity: If for a given scalar there exists a matrix sequence satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, then it follows immediately that (8) holds for the same and with . Sufficiency: Pre-and postmultiplying (8) by and its transpose, respectively, implies that Finally, by Schur's complement, it follows that the latter inequality is equivalent to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>In the sequel we shall develop an LMI method of robust filtering for system (1) based on Theorem 1. Specifically, given a scalar , a filter is designed such that there exist a quadratic matrix function of , , and a matrix independent of satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> By Lemma 3 and Theorem 1, (9) implies that the estimation error system is exponentially stable and for all in . It should be noted that if ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is satisfied with parameter-independent matrices and , then it is also satisfied with . Without loss of generality, the quadratic matrix function of , , is written in the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where and are real symmetric matrices and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> The next theorem presents the robust filter design method, which is derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> with as in (10) and using appropriate parameterizations of the filter matrices and , together with a congruent transformation and Finsler's lemma. First, introduce the notation ensures that the estimation error system is exponentially stable and for all . Proof: It will be shown that if the inequalities of ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) hold, then the filter (22) ensures that ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is satisfied with a quadratic parameter-dependent matrix . First, note that as the inequality ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) depends affinely on , then ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) also holds for all . Moreover, ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) implies that and</p><p>(23)</p><p>To show this, pre-and postmultiplying ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) by and its transpose, respectively, where and , we get As belongs to , it follows that and . Next, observe that with the matrix as in ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is equivalent to To simplify the notation, in the sequel the dependence on and of the matrices will be omitted. Let the 2 2 matrix in (28) be parameterized as follows:</p><p>( Taking into account (33), (34), and (39)-(41), it can be readily verified that (38) is identical to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Thus, ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is satisfied with as given in (30) and</p><p>(42)</p><p>Finally, by Theorem 1 and Lemma 3, one concludes that the estimation error system is exponentially stable and for all . Notice that the use of filter parameterization and congruent transformation has also been employed in others LMI methods of robust filtering, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, the parameterizations and transformation used in Theorem 2 are new and have the feature that they can also be used for designing a switching filter for discrete-time piecewise linear systems (i.e., systems that switch between different linear models depending on whether the state belongs to a specified state-space partition), where the structure of the state-space partitions is incorporated in the filter design <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This feature is not present in the parameterizations and transformations found in the literature, e.g., those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>It should be remarked that Theorem 2, as well as Lemma 3 and Theorem 1, also applies in the case where is not an energy signal (i.e., is not finite) but has a nonzero root mean-square (rms) value , namely</p><p>In such a situation, the system norm is defined in terms of the rms values of the relevant signals, in lieu of the signals norm . Remark 1: The robust filter design method of Theorem 2 takes into consideration bounds on the variation of the uncertain parameters and is based on a Lyapunov function which depends quadratically on the uncertain parameters. This is in contrast with the existing results based on quadratic stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the filtering methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which use an affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov function and are restricted to the case of uncertain constant parameters. It should be noted that finding the optimal filter of Theorem 2, namely, the filter with the smallest upper bound on the norm of the estimation error system, can be achieved via the following convex optimization problem: minimize subject to and Furthermore, observe that the filter transfer function matrix of Theorem 2 is, in general, proper, i.e., there is a directly feedforward from the measured signal to the estimate of . However, if a strictly proper filter is desired, this can be readily achieved but imposing the constraint to the LMIs of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Note that the level of noise attenuation that can be achieved with an optimal strictly proper filter, in general, is likely to be larger than that achieved with an optimal proper filter. The reason for this is that in the design of an optimal strictly proper filter, by setting , reduces the degree of freedom in the referred to above optimization problem, as compared to the case of designing an optimal proper filter. This fact is illustrated via an example in the next section.</p><p>Remark 2: Note that Theorem 2 specializes to robust filtering methods based on either quadratic stability, or an affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, by imposing certain constraints to the matrices , , and of the LMIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Observe that, setting , , and , it follows from (23), (40), and (42) that of (10) becomes parameter-independent, namely, , and thus the filtering method of 2 reduces to a quadratic stability based method. On the other hand, setting renders the matrix affine in , namely, . It should be remarked that Theorem 2 is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a filter such that the norm inequality ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) holds with either a parameter-independent matrix or a matrix which depends affinely on . Indeed, the sufficiency follows immediately as pointed out in Remark 2, whereas the converse results are provided by the next two lemmas.</p><p>Lemma 4: Consider system (1) and let be a polytope of admissible . Suppose that for a given scalar there exists an asymptotically stable filter with state-space realization such that the estimation error system (3) satisfies ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) with , where . Then, this filter can be also obtained from Theorem 2 for the same and with . Proof: Let the matrix of (9) be partitioned as follows, where all the blocks are matrices:</p><p>As , it follows from (9) that , which implies that and are nonsingular matrices. In addition, since (9) is strict, without loss of generality, and can be assumed to be nonsingular; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This implies that is a nonsingular matrix as well. Next, let be a positive scalar and define the matrices  <ref type="formula">15</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">44</ref>)-(47), it can be readily established that (49) (50) As ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) holds with and since belongs to a compact set , it follows from (9) that there exists a sufficiently small scalar such that for all (51)</p><p>where and</p><p>With the matrices , , , , , , , and as above, , and considering (49) and ( <ref type="formula">50</ref>), it can be easily derived that the left-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), denoted by , becomes where is the given filter matrix and Applying Schur's complement and considering (51), one concludes that , . Finally, in view of (46), the filter transfer matrix (22) of Theorem 2 reduces to . It follows from the proof of Lemma 4 that when Theorem 2 is applied with an affine parameter dependent matrix , i.e., by imposing the constraint , without loss of generality, the matrix of LMIs ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) can be chosen as in (48), where is a sufficiently small positive scalar. Under these conditions, ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) becomes <ref type="bibr">(52)</ref> where Applying Schur's complement to (52) and considering that the scalar is sufficiently small, it can be readily established that (52), or equivalently <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, reduces to the LMIs (53) Lemma 5: Consider system (1) and let be a polytope of admissible . Suppose that for a given scalar there exists an asymptotically stable filter with state-space realization such that the estimation error system (3) satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> with . Then, this filter can be also obtained from Theorem 2 for the same and with , , and . Proof: The proof is similar to that of Lemma 4, except that now . Remark 3: In light of Remark 2 and Lemmas 4 and 5, the robust filtering method of Theorem 2 is never more conservative than the approaches based on either an affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov function or quadratic stability. Simulation studies have revealed that the proposed filtering method provide better performance than the quadratic stability-based approach.</p><p>Remark 4: It should be remarked that the robust filtering method proposed in this paper finds application in a number of important estimation problems in signal processing, where uncertain time-varying parameters are unavoidable (due to modeling errors and parameter drifting) and high precision and robustness are required, as, for instance, in channel identification and equalization, estimation of sinusoids in white noise, and echo cancellation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>A possible application of the proposed filter design is to the problem of channel inversion where the channel model is subject to uncertain time-varying parameters. More specifically, let an unknown signal be the input to a linear channel and the output of be corrupted by an additive disturbance to yield the observation signal given by where , , are known parameters and , , are uncertain time-varying deviations satisfying where and , and , are known extremal values of and , respectively. The objective is to obtain an estimate of the channel input signal , based on the observations , via a causal estimator. Note that the estimation of the channel input Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Minimum with strictly proper filters for jj 0:3, j1j and a consistent . must be performed in the presence of time-varying uncertain parameters in the channel model.</p><p>It turns out that this problem is a special case of the filtering problem treated in this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 10.6]</ref>. Although the aim of this paper is not to provide a full description of this problem, all the capabilities of the proposed robust filtering methodology would apply, namely, noise attenuation (by means of an attenuation level) and signal estimation in the presence of modeling uncertainty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has addressed the problem of robust filtering for linear discrete-time state-space models which depend affinely on time-varying uncertain parameters. The parameter values and their variations are assumed to be constrained to given intervals. An LMI method has been developed for designing a stationary linear discrete-time filter with a prescribed performance in the sense, in spite of significant parameter uncertainty. The proposed method incorporates information on available bounds on both the admissible values and variation of the uncertain parameters and is based on a Lyapunov function which depends quadratically on the uncertain parameters. The new filter design clearly reduces the overdesign encountered in the existing LMI approach of robust filtering via a parameter-independent Lyapunov function.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, and Alexandre Trofino Neto Abstract-This paper deals with the problem of robust filtering for linear discrete-time state-space models with uncertain time-varying parameters. The parameters enter affinely into the state-space model matrices, and their admissible values and variations are assumed to belong to given intervals. A method is derived for designing a linear stationary asymptotically stable filter with a prescribed performance, in spite of large parameter uncertainty. The proposed method incorporates information on available bounds on both the admissible values and variation of the uncertain parameters and is based on a Lyapunov function with quadratic dependence on the parameters. The filter design is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities.
