<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>It is well known that in set-valued (e.g. interval) and in fuzzy arithmetic, the standard Minkowski addition and multiplication are not invertible operations and the idea of finding some inverse operation has been a field of long interest; a well known and largely used example is the Hukuhara difference, proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>, but in many applications it appears to have several limitations and to be very restrictive.</p><p>On the other hand, inversion of addition and multiplication is fundamental in interval and fuzzy arithmetic and analysis, with applications to the solution of equations, to the concepts of differentiability, to interval and fuzzy integral and differential equations, to interval and fuzzy regression analysis, etc.</p><p>The study of interval and fuzzy equations has been considered for a long time, following various approaches; methods to solve fuzzy equations have been developed in connections with the techniques of interval and set-valued analysis (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31]</ref> and, for interval analysis, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29]</ref>). Also systems of fuzzy equations have been considered e.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32]</ref>.</p><p>The interval and fuzzy differential equations (FDE) have a long history (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34]</ref> for recent results and for other references) and the use of the classical Hukuhara derivative in FDE has been criticized (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2]</ref>).</p><p>A generalization of Hukuhara difference, as the least squares or L 2 -norm solution of equation A + X = B, has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref> and used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref> in the context of fuzzy linear regression.</p><p>In this paper we propose generalizations of difference and division as inverse operations (in some sense) to addition and multiplication.</p><p>For the difference, we consider the general setting of set-valued arithmetic and we suggest some generalizations (the classical Hukuhara difference is a special case) for compact sets, for compact convex sets (in particular compact intervals) and for fuzzy sets with compact and convex -cuts (in particular fuzzy numbers).</p><p>For the division, we consider the setting of interval-valued arithmetic and of fuzzy numbers. Both operations are related to two important problems in the interval and fuzzy arithmetic and analysis:</p><p>(a) the solution of linear equations and (b) the (generalized) differentiability of interval-and fuzzy-valued functions and the use of the corresponding derivative in the formulation of interval and fuzzy differential equations.</p><p>The two topics have been addressed by a consistent scientific activity and numerous papers appeared in the literature. It is out of the scope of this paper to discuss both problems in detail; but we will remark how the proposed generalizations can be useful for both problems.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the generalizations of the Hukuhara difference for compact and compact convex sets. The important cases of compact intervals and multidimensional boxes are detailed in Section 3. Section 4 introduces the generalized Hukuhara difference (gH-difference) for fuzzy numbers and gives conditions for its existence. Section 5 considers a generalization of interval and fuzzy division. Possible applications to linear equations and fuzzy differentiability are briefly illustrated in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">General setting</head><p>Consider a metric vector space X with the induced topology and in particular the space X = R n , n Ն 1, of real vectors equipped with standard addition and scalar multiplication operations. Following Diamond and Kloeden (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>), denote by K(X) and K C (X) the spaces of nonempty compact and compact convex sets of X. Given two subsets A, B ⊆ X and k ∈ R, Minkowski addition and scalar multiplication are defined by A + B = {a + b|a ∈ A, b ∈ B} and k A = {ka|a ∈ A} and it is well known that addition is associative and commutative and with neutral element {0}. If k = -1, scalar multiplication gives the opposite -A = (-1)A = {-a|a ∈ A} but, in general, A + (-A) {0}, i.e. the opposite of A is not the inverse of A in Minkowski addition (unless</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A = {a} is a singleton). Minkowski difference is A -B = A + (-1)B = {a -b|a ∈ A, b ∈ B}. A first implication of this fact is that, in general, even if it is true that (A + C = B + C) ⇐⇒ A = B, addition/subtraction simplification is not valid, i.e. (A + B) -B A.</formula><p>To partially overcome this situation, Hukuhara <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> introduced the following H-difference:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A0B = C ⇐ ⇒ A = B + C (1)</formula><p>and an important property of 0 is that A0A = {0}, ∀A ∈ K(X) and (A + B)0B = A, ∀A, B ∈ K(X); H-difference is unique, but a necessary condition for A0B to exist is that A contains a translate {c}+ B of B. In general, A -B A0B.</p><p>From an algebraic point of view, the difference of two sets A and B may be interpreted both in terms of addition as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(1)</ref> or in terms of negative addition, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">AB = C ⇐ ⇒ B = A + (-1)C,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where (-1)C is the opposite set of C. Conditions (1) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) are compatible to each other and this suggests a generalization of Hukuhara difference:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Definition 1.

The equivalence (A0B) = C ⇐⇒ ( A0C) = B is valid only for 0, or for 0 g in case (i). In fact, if A0 g B = C in the sense (ii), then B = A-C and this does not imply A = B +C nor C = A-B unless B = B +C -C (i.e. C = { c}) or B = B + A -A (i.e. A = { a}).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof. In case 1 subadditivity of s 1 and s</head><formula xml:id="formula_16">2 means that, ∀ p , p ∈ S n-1 s 1 : s A ( p + p ) -s B ( p + p ) Յ s A ( p ) + s A ( p ) -s B ( p ) -s B ( p ) s 2 : s B ( p + p ) -s A ( p + p ) Յ s B ( p ) + s B ( p ) -s A ( p ) -s A ( p ), it follows that s A ( p + p ) -s A ( p ) -s A ( p ) Յ s B ( p + p ) -s B ( p ) -s B ( p ) s B ( p + p ) -s B ( p ) -s B ( p ) Յ s A ( p + p ) -s A ( p ) -s A ( p )</formula><p>so that equality holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">s B ( p + p ) -s A ( p + p ) = s B ( p ) + s B ( p ) -s A ( p ) -s A ( p ).

For example, the solution based on the application of the extension principle (i.e. X = {x|ax + b = c for a ∈ A, b ∈ B and c ∈ C}) will not satisfy the equation algebraically.</p><p>For the fuzzy case, some authors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>) have proposed a procedure where the possible solutions are ordered by preference, like:</p><p>1. try to find the interval-arithmetic-based solution X 1 (using the -cuts) satisfying exactly our equation; if such a solution exists (i.e. the resulting -cuts produce a fuzzy number) then accept it; 2. otherwise, apply the extension principle or, depending on the problem at hand, 3. apply approximated interval arithmetic.</p><p>In the first subsection, we show that the proposed generalized difference and division can be used to produce a solution of interval and algebraic equations.</p><p>The second subsection addresses the definition of the derivative for interval-valued and fuzzy-valued functions and its application to interval and fuzzy differential equations. Also this problem has received great attention in the recent literature. Using the gH-difference proposed in this paper, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> the advantages of this new definition are illustrated for the interval case and it seems to be a useful tool to overcome several difficulties posed by the standard Hukuhara derivative, e.g. its restricted range of existence and the possibilistic irreversibility effect described e.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>.</p></div>

The proposed gH-difference always exists in the one-dimensional interval case and a simple necessary and sufficient condition for its existence in the multidimensional interval case is given. The gH-difference is also suggested for fuzzy numbers and we give simple conditions for its existence and the rules to determine it.</p><p>We adopt a similar approach to define a generalization of division ÷ g , called g-division, of unidimensional intervals (for which it always exists) and for fuzzy numbers and we show properties and existence conditions.</p><p>Work in progress uses the proposed gH-difference operator to define generalized differentiability for interval-and fuzzy-valued functions and for theory and numerical algorithms in interval and fuzzy differential equations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> for the interval case and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> for fuzzy differential equations).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>) Proposition 2 (Remark 3 .Remark 4 .Remark 5 .</head><label>2345</label><figDesc>Unicity of A0 g B). If C = A0 g B exists, it is unique and if also A0B exists then A0 g B = A0B. Proof. If C = A0 g B exists in case (i), we obtain C = A0B which is unique. Suppose that case (ii) is satisfied for C and D, i.e. B = A + (-1)C and B = A + (-1)D; then A + (-1)C = A + (-1)D ⇒ (-1)C = (-1)D ⇒ C = D. If case (i) is satisfied for C and case (ii) is satisfied for D, i.e. A = B + C and B = A + (-1)D, then B = B + C + (-1)D ⇒ {0} = C -D and this is possible only if C = D = {c} is a singleton. ç The generalized Hukuhara difference A0 g B will be called the gH-difference of A and B. A necessary condition for A0 g B to exist is that either A contains a translate of B (as for A0B) or B contains a translate of A. In fact, for any given c ∈ C, we get B + {c} ⊆ A from (i) or A + {-c} ⊆ B from (ii). It is possible that A = B + C and B = A + (-1)C hold simultaneously; in this case, A and B translate into each other and C is a singleton. In fact, A = B + C implies B + {c} ⊆ A∀c ∈ C and B = A + (-1)C implies A -{c} ⊆ B ∀c ∈ C i.e. A ⊆ B + {c}; it follows that A = B + {c} and B = A + {-c}. On the other hand, if c , c ∈ C then A = B + {c } = B + {c } and this requires c = c . If A0 g B exists, then B0 g A exists and B0 g A = -( A0 g B).</figDesc></figure>

(In general, B0 g A = A0 g B does not imply A = B; but A0 g B = B0 g A = C if and only if C = -C and, in particular, C = {0} if and only if A = B. (5) If B0 g A exists then either A + (B0 g A) = B or B -(B0 g A) = A and both equalities hold if and onlyif B0 g A is a singleton set. (6) If B0 g A = C exists, then for all D ∈ K(X) either (B + D)0 g A = C + D or B0 g ( A + D) = C -D. Proof. Property 1 is immediate. To prove 2(a) if C = ( A+B)0 g B then either A+B = C +B or B = (A+B)+(-1)C = B + ( A + (-1)C); in the first case it follows that C = A,in the second case A + (-1)C = {0} and A and C are singleton sets so A = C. With a similar argument, 2(b) and 2(c) can be proved. To prove the first part of (3) let C = A0 g B according to case (i), i.e. A = B +C, then A = B -(-C) and B0 g A = -C according to case (ii); if instead C = A0 g B according to case (ii), i.e. B = A -C, then B = A + (-C) and B0 g A = -C according to case (i); on the other hand, if A = B + C or B = A -C, then -A = -B + (-C) or -B = -A + C and this means (-B)0 g (-A) = C. To see the first part of (4) consider for example the unidimensional case A = [a -, a + ], B = [b -, b + ]; equality A -B = B -A is valid if a -+ a + = b -+ b + and this does not require A = B (unless A and B are singletons). For the second part of (4), from (A0 g B) = (B0 g A) = C, considering the four combinations derived from (3), one of the following four cases is valid: ( A = B + C and B = A + C) or (A = B + C and A = B -C) or (B = A + (-1)C and B = A + C) or (B = A + (-1)C and A = B + (-1)C); in all of them we deduce C = -C and C = {0} if and only if A = B.</figDesc></figure>

We call u = ( u, u, u) ∈ I × P × S 0 (where we assume ( u, u) be a valid pair) as the CPS-decomposition of u ∈ F (C = Crisp, P = Profile, S = 0-Symmetric fuzzy).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">The fuzzy case</head><p>The search for alternative definitions of the division operator between fuzzy numbers has received some attention in recent literature, with the objective of inverting multiplication; some recent studies are in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35]</ref>. In particular, Boukezzoula et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> have analyzed the fuzzy division in a way similar to our setting (considering case (i) of the division operator).

We have seen that, for unidimensional intervals, the gH-difference always exists. Denote by len(A) = a +a - the length of interval A. It is well known from classical interval arithmetic that an interval X satisfying (39) exists only if len(B) Ն len( A) (in Minkowski arithmetic we have len( A + X ) Ն max{len( A), len(X )}); in fact, no such X exists with x -Յ x + if len(B) &lt; len(A) and we cannot solve (39) unless we interpret it as B -X = A.</p><p>If we do so, we get case len(B) Յ len(A) :</p><p>We then obtain that X = B0 g A is the unique solution to (39) and it always exists, i.e.:</p><p>Proposition 39.
