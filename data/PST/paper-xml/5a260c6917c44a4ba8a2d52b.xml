<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Occupancy detection for buildings is crucial to improving energy efficiency, user comfort, and space utility. However, existing methods require dedicated system setup, continuous calibration, and frequent maintenance. With the instrumentation of electricity meters in millions of homes and offices, however, power measurement presents a unique opportunity for a non-intrusive and cost-effective way to detect occupant presence. This study develops solutions to the problems when no data or limited data is available for training, as motivated by difficulties in ground truth collection. Experimental evaluations on data from both residential and commercial buildings indicate that the proposed methods for binary occupancy detection are nearly as accurate as models learned with sufficient data, with accuracies of approximately 78 to 93% for residences and 90% for offices. This study shows that power usage contains valuable and sensitive user information, demonstrating a virtual occupancy sensing approach with minimal system calibration and setup.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>T ECHNOLOGICAL innovations in sensor networks and mobile computing extend the frontiers of building science and opens up a wealth of opportunities. A combination of factors contribute to the connectedness of pervasive sensing nodes: lowered manufacturing cost, miniaturized size and enhanced functionality, integrated sensing services, visualization, and actuation, and raised awareness of energy, privacy, and security issues.</p><p>Individuals spend 90% of their time in buildings, either in their homes or in their offices. Buildings consume approximately 40% of all energy usage in the United States. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting are responsible for 43% and 11% of energy usage in residential buildings, and 33% and 26% of energy usage in commercial buildings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Among various measures for energy savings, such as building renovations, dynamic pricing, and social games, occupancy sensing has been shown to contribute to both occupant comfort and energy efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The current study focuses on binary-level presence detection (i.e., 0/1 decision -a room or a house is either occupied or vacant), as opposed to the occupancy of an identified individual or the number of people in a region. Binary information is usually sufficient for applications like automated zonal control for indoor temperature, air quality, and lighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, as well as health monitoring in residential buildings <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Existing approaches to occupancy detection use either reliable but specialized sensors, such as cameras <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, passive infrared (PIR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, magnetic reed switches <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, active RFID badges <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, or non-specialized for occupancy detection yet fallible environmental measurements, including CO 2 Manuscript received ; revised <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and particulate matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. With the installation of electricity meters in millions of homes and offices <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which are continuously monitoring power usage, one question comes to mind: "Can energy consumption be used to indicate one's presence?"</p><p>While previous work that relies on power measurements focuses on situations where sufficient data is available from target households <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, collecting the occupancy ground truth that is required to train the detection algorithms is a challenging process. It often relies on 1) user engagement, e.g., completing a survey every 15 or 60 minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, or uploading the GPS trajectory data as a proxy for their presence ground truth <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, 2) instrumentation efforts, e.g., setting up a wireless network of cameras, motion sensors, or door switches <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A systematic approach that relaxes the requirement of ground truth data collection is desirable for practical application.</p><p>The following scenarios illustrate some emerging applications of smart meters <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, in which user presence information can bring direct benefits: Scenario 1 (S1): Occupants in an office building participate in a social game to save energy by having their cubicles instrumented with power meters <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Building managers want to correlate the energy consumption pattern of the building with the schedules of its occupants and assess its energy efficiency. However, they prefer an easy and nonintrusive way to access the occupant presence information without additional infrastructures or surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scenario 2 (S2):</head><p>A start-up company on smart meters for home automation has collected a substantial amount of occupancy and electricity data from incentivized households to train its presence detection system. A targeted product feature is effortless calibration by requiring minimal inputs from new customers while maintaining comparable performances.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Key system components that offer occupancy-aware services that are enabled by presence detection.</p><p>In both situations, smart meters are viable proxies for demand approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (S1) and/or home automation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (S2) by extending basic metering functionality to presence detection. The benefits of higher detection accuracy include more substantial energy savings and reliable automation systems with no additional costs to instrument sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Nevertheless, these two problems differ in training source availability: While S1 is characterized by very limited presence data accessible to the learner, while S2 features extensive data but not from its customers' households.</p><p>Hence, the objective of this study is to develop solutions to address the issues that arise while learning from limited or no training data. Key components of the end system include 1) electricity measurements from buildingand/or device-level meters, 2) occupancy detection based on power usage, e.g., Non-intrusive Learning (NL) or Transfer-Learning (TL) methods proposed in the study, and 3) occupancy-aware applications, e.g., demand controlled ventilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and lighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and buildinglevel demand response <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Our main contributions are summarized below:</p><p>• Formulates the problems as Base Learning (BL), Nonintrusive Learning (NL), and Transfer Learning (TL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Explores power features and studies the window and sampling effects as a practice guide.</p><p>• Develops and evaluates solutions to NL and TL for residential and commercial buildings, which achieves around 80 to 90% accuracy.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Formulations of BL, NL, and TL are described in § 2. § 3 introduces the methods, in particular, multiview-based iteration and surrogate loss methods for NL ( § 3.2), and the transfer learning optimization method for TL ( § 3.3), as well as explores power features ( § 3.4). BL, NL, and TL datasets and results are reported and discussed in § 4. While related work is summarized in § 5, § 6 concludes this study and proposes future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PROBLEM FORMULATIONS</head><p>In this section, we first describe the basic framework, and then formulate the problems that prompted the solutions proposed in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Basic Framework</head><p>We set the basic framework of our learning problem, in which the notations follow the literature from statistical decision theory. We use "presence" and "occupancy" interchangeably in the texts.</p><p>The dataset, S = {(x 1 , y 1 ), • • • , (x n , y n )}, includes electricity and occupancy data. The presence information, y ∈ Y = {-1, +1}, takes either the value of +1 or -1, indicating the state of presence (occupancy) or absence (vacancy), which are often provided by users <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or reliable sensors like camera <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, ultrasonic <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and passive infrared (PIR) sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The measurement data, x ∈ X = Ś m j=1 X j , consists of m distinct features derived from electricity and time, as described in § 3.4. We make the following assumptions in the design of occupancy detectors.</p><p>Assumption 1: While an individual's energy consumption and occupancy behaviors are stable over the period of interests, two individuals' consumption and occupancy behaviors may differ.</p><p>Assumption 2: Samples in S are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). 1  Our goal is to learn the presence detector f that minimizes the risk, R l,F (f ) = Ef∈F [l(y, f (x))], where F delineates the range of detectors, for instance, the class of linear classifiers, and l : Y × Y → R is the loss function, which penalizes mistakes in detection. An example is the 0-1 loss l 01 (y, f (x)) = 1(y = f (x)) that results in 1 if the two arguments differ and 0 otherwise.</p><p>Since we can only access the unknown power consumption behaviors through the dataset S, our strategy is to search for the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) as given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f = arg min f ∈F 1 n n i=1 l(f (x i ), y i )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The regret characterizes how "poorly" the learner has performed compared to the performance of the best achievable learner in the class, as given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">δR l,F (f ) = R l,F (f ) risk of f -inf f ∈F R l,F (f )</formula><p>risk of the best detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where a tight upper bound on the regret suggests a performance guarantee of the algorithm when used in practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Problem Formulations</head><p>Presence learning problems can be described as follows:</p><p>• Base Learning (BL): Find the optimal detector given the power and occupancy data from a user, S.</p><p>• Non-intrusive Learning (NL): Find the corresponding occupancy classifier with only the electricity usage data.</p><p>• Transfer Learning (TL): Learn a presence detector for the target home where limited data is available based on sufficient power and occupancy data from a group of similar households.</p><p>The set up of BL, as in most previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, requires the collection of presence and energy data for an extended period of time to train the classifier. Then, the classifier makes presence decisions when new electricity measurement information is provided.</p><p>NL, in comparison, corresponds to Scenario 1. Instead of intrusively collecting user's states for training purposes, the learning process is based on electricity data alone.</p><p>TL refers to Scenario 2, in which several individuals (households), or source, have been surveyed for a prolonged period of time. But, only limited data has been obtained for the individuals of interests, or target. The objective is to transfer the knowledge from the source to the target, and improve the detection accuracy of the target task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Discussion</head><p>Due to the difficulties in collecting the occupancy ground truth data, there is increasing demand to move away from BL and shift toward NL and TL.</p><p>The design of occupancy detection algorithm involves trade-offs among the following practical concerns:</p><p>Accuracy. Generally, a higher rate of accuracy for the algorithm is preferred. But, the cost of an erroneous detection differs based on the presence system's application and issue severity. For instance, if a company's alarm system fails to detect an intrusion, the issue severity and resulting cost are high. However, if a home automation system falsely assumes presence, the issue severity and resulting cost are low <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Costs. The capital costs are due to the smart meters quantity and complexity, as well as the communication and storage infrastructures. The training costs involve the time and labor invested in collecting presence data for system calibration, which might be different for recruited individuals and new customers.</p><p>The solution to the more challenging NL and TL problems is based on three key observations: 1) Energy consumption differs markedly when individuals are present versus when they are absent. 2) Office buildings are usually vacant during nonbusiness hours. 3) As noted by Nobel laureate Kahneman in his book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, people's behaviors are patterned (the "slow" system) with spontaneous deviations (the "fast" system). These patterns are consistent over time.</p><p>While the third point lays the foundation for tackling the TL problem, the first two points lead to the solutions to the NL problem, as detailed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODOLOGY</head><p>The core of the presence detection methods is embodied in the answers to these two questions: 1) What is the set of features derived from power usage that is most indicative of user presence, and 2) How can one estimate this correspondence. BL approaches approximate this relationship based on training data from the target. Due to a lack of direct access to data for NL and TL, the "multiview" and "transferability" assumptions have been created. They are detailed in § 3.2 and § 3.3, respectively. § 3.4 illustrates the design and selection of power features that address the first question about the features that are the most indicative of user presence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Base Learning Methods</head><p>The BL goal is to find the learner f that can minimize the empirical loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. A variety of models have been proposed, such as naïve Bayes, Bayes net, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), decision tree (J48), and random forest. These models follow the same ERM framework but differ in the loss function selection.</p><p>For instance, SVM optimizes the hinge loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">l hinge (f (x i ), y i ) = max(0, 1 -y i f (x i )) where f (x i ) = ω, x i is linear and parameterized by ω ∈ R m .</formula><p>Intuitively, it seeks a decision boundary that maximizes the distance from the two classes, with a special focus on those near the boundary, a.k.a., the "support vectors".</p><p>The loss function reflects how the model treats the misclassification error, which, together with the function that predicts each instance, offers a summary of the method. More details about the BL algorithms can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. BL algorithm implementations are also available, for example, LibSVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and Weka <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Experimental results are reported in § 4.2.</p><p>As BL's framework generally requires substantial training data, it is not suitable if user convenience is key. In the next section, we discuss how the NL and TL solutions satisfy the user convenience requirement by modifying the loss function or optimization problem, e.g., surrogate loss in § 3.2.2, and knowledge transfer in § 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Non-intrusive Learning Methods</head><p>Unlike BL, the solution to the NL problem requires the use of problem-specific structures as we lack sufficient data to estimate the presence -electricity correspondence. The key is to use time as clues to infer occupant presence. As individuals are habitual, this demonstrates consistency principle for commercial and residential buildings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</p><p>Let X v1 and X v2 be two "views" that partition the original feature space, X = X v1 Ś X v2 = Ś m j=1 X j , and F v• be the associated function space. Our methods are based on the following assumption:</p><p>Multiview Assumption: The multiview assumption states that each view, power or time, is sufficient for the problem at hand, as suggested by Blum and Mitchell <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">The risks R l,Fv• (f * v• ) of learn- ers trained by each "view" v• separately, f * v• = arg min f ∈Fv• E [l(y, f (x ∈ X v• ))], is comparable to the risk, R l,F (f * ), of the learner trained on the complete feature space, f * = arg min f ∈F E [l(y, f (x ∈ X ))].</formula><p>Next, we describe two approaches, multiview-based iteration training (MIT) and surrogate loss. Based on our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the first method initializes the training set by the time view, and iteratively refines the labels until a stopping criterion is met. Built on the work of Natarajan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the second method uses the surrogate loss in replacement for the original loss, in order to "reverse" the effect of labels' corruption introduced to the training data by the time view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Multiview-based Iteration Training</head><p>Assign the first view, X v1 , as the time of the day, and the second view, X v2 , as the power-derived features, and let f v1 and f v2 denote the classifiers based on the two views respectively. Given the unlabeled dataset</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S = {(x v1 1 , x v2 1 ), • • • , (x v1 n , x v2 n )}</formula><p>, where x v1 i ∈ X v1 and x v2 i ∈ X v2 , MIT proceeds as follows (the pseudo-code can be found in the appendix): </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L t+1 j = {L t j ∩ L t j,n } ∪ Sample{L t j ∆L t j,n ; α j } (3) for j ∈ {-1, +1}, where L t j = {((x v1 i , x v2 i , ŷi )|ŷ i = j},</formula><p>and L t j,n denote the set of samples whose labels are newly classified as j, L t j ∆L t j,n is the symmetric difference set operation, and α j is the sampling rate for label j ∈ {-1, +1}. 4) Stopping condition: Stop the iteration whenever <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> in Theorem 3.3 is satisfied.</p><p>The dataset update (3) keeps the samples in which the labels are agreed upon in the two successive iterations, and insert a random subset of "controversial" samples, with α j ∈ [0, 1] controlling the learning rate. The stopping rule ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is triggered when it seems unlikely that additional iterations can improve the accuracy rate.</p><p>Different than the BL, MIT operates in a condition such that the noise in the training set can not be ignored. The probably approximately correct (PAC) framework proposed by Valiant <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> can be applied to resolve this issue. Theorem 3.1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> If we draw a sequence of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">n ≥ 2 2 (1 -2η) 2 log 2N δ (4)</formula><p>samples from a distribution and find any hypothesis f i that minimizes disagreement with the training labels, where is the hypothesis worst-case classification error rate, η is the upper bound on the training noise rate, N is the number of hypotheses, and δ is the confidence, then the following PAC property is satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P [d (f i , f * ) ≥ ] ≤ δ<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where d(, ) is the sum over the probability of elements from the symmetric difference between the two hypotheses f i and the optimal f * .</p><p>The above theorem provides a high probability bound on the classification error given the training noise rate, which can be estimated as follows. If we let</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L t -1 = L t -1, ∪ L t -1,× , where L t -1,</formula><p>and L t -1,× are the set of true negative and false positive samples, respectively, similarly</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L t +1 = L t +1, ∪ L t +1,× , also U t = U t -1 ∪ U t +1</formula><p>is the set of unlabeled samples, then the training noise rate, η t , is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">η t = |L t -1,× | + |L t +1,× | |L t -1 | + |L t +1 |<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Assume the hypothesis makes classification errors at the rate t . The following lemma is established to estimate the training noise rate η t and hypothesis classification error t in each iteration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 3.2.</head><p>The training noise rate η t and hypothesis classification error t can be estimated assuming we have access to any two of the following quantities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">a) (Prior information) the number of negative samples, namely |L t -1, |+|L t +1,× |+|U t -1 |, or |L t -1, |+|L t +1,× |</formula><p>for the labeled set b) (Type I or II error) the misclassification rate for either the positive or negative samples, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">|L t -1,× | |L t -1,× |+|L t +1, | or |L t +1,× | |L t +1,× |+|L t -1, | .</formula><p>The set of equations for estimation are derived in the appendix. Theorem 3.1 provides the relationship among the number of training samples, n, the training noise bound, η, and the classification error rate, , of the hypothesis that minimizes the training error. Lemma 3.2 offers a method to calculate the classification noise rate η t in the t round. Inspired by Zhou and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and Goldman and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, we state the following theorem that guarantees that classification performance will improve in each round.</p><p>Theorem 3.3. The gap between the learned and optimal hypotheses as shown in PAC property (5) will decrease with high probability in each iteration with suitable sampling rates, α -1 and α +1 , whenever the following condition is satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">|L t+1 -1 | + |L t+1 +1 | (1 -2η t+1 ) 2 &gt; |L t -1 | + |L t +1 | (1 -2η t ) 2 (7) where |L t+1 -1 | + |L t+1 +1 |</formula><p>is the total number of samples in the training set in round t + 1, and η t+1 is the training noise rate. Theorem 3.3 suggests the stopping indicator as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">1{ |L t+1 -1 |+|L t+1 +1 | (1-2η t+1 ) 2 ≤ |L t -1 |+|L t +1 | (1-2η t ) 2 } (8)</formula><p>which evaluates to 1 when the condition in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is not satisfied. Frequent occurrences of such events might be a strong indication to stop the algorithm and avoid potential deterioration, as illustrated in § 4. The proof for Lemma 3.2 and Theorem 3.3 can be found in the appendix.</p></div>

As suggested by Natarajan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, another approach is to recognize the presence of noise with ρ -1 = P(ỹ = +1|y = -1) and ρ +1 = P(ỹ = -1|y = +1) as the label corruption probability, and a design loss function as a substitute for the original loss to "reverse" the corruption process. The procedure of the surrogate loss approach is described below, and Algorithm 1 illustrates the implementation. 1) Initialization: Set the collected data where the presence is estimated by prior knowledge, i.e., occupancy schedules (line 1). 2) Cross-validation: For each parameter θ ∈ Θ CV ⊂ Θ in a finite subset of the parameter space, obtain the empirical risks associated with θ, RCV (θ), following the standard cross-validation procedure on the surrogate loss, l(t, y; θ) (lines 2, 3). 3) Learning with surrogate loss: Identify the best parameter as suggested by the previous step, θ * = arg min θ∈Θ CV RCV (θ), and use it to obtain the new presence labels for the dataset (lines 4 to 6).</p><p>The first step in the above procedure is based on the multiview assumption, and the second step is motivated by parameter optimization θ = {ρ +1 , ρ -1 }, since the conditional noise rates, ρ ±1 , are unknown.</p><p>Based on corrupted learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and label-dependent loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, two different surrogate losses are summarized below:</p><p>• With the learning under corruption scheme, the surrogate loss is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">l(f (x), ỹ) = (1 -ρ -ỹ )l(f (x), ỹ) -ρ ỹ l(f (x), -ỹ) 1 -ρ +1 -ρ -1<label>(9</label></formula><p>) where ρ ỹ is the conditional noise rate, and l : Y × Y → R is the original loss function.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Transfer Learning Methods</head><p>The main issue with the TL problem as outlined in § 2.2 is data abundance/scarcity. While the dataset from the households of interests, or target, is limited, the dataset from the different households that might have different energy usage patterns, or source, is ample.</p><p>The key lies in the answer to the question, how we can we ''apply the knowledge" gained from analyzing a dataset with similar characteristics to the dataset in question? We can completely ignore the question by performing BL, such as SVM, for each individual independently; however, it might be difficult for the learner to generalize the learning instances by relying on the limited data from the target household alone. In this case, data from the other households that share similar consumption patterns might be useful in estimating the correspondence between the occupancy and power measurements, crucial to the detector's performance overall.</p><p>For SVM, the learner assumes the form f (k) (x) = sgn ( x, ω k ), where x ∈ X is the feature input and ω k is the parameter for individual k. Instead of training ω k independently, Evgeniou and Pontil <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> proposes the following decomposition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">ω k = ω 0 + v k (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>where ω 0 is the common component that is shared in the group, and v k represents the individual effect which is unique for each household. With the model specified above and based on the original problem as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, the new optimization is formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">min ω0,v k ,ξ (k) i J 1 (ξ (k) i ) + J 2 (ω 0 , v k ) s. t. y (k) i ω 0 + v k , x (k) i ≥ 1 -ξ (k) i ξ (k) i ≥ 0, k ∈ S T ∪ {K}, i ∈ [m(k)] (P1)</formula><p>where m(k) is the data size for task k, [m(k)] = {1, ..., m(k)} uses our set notation, S T ∪ {K} is the union of the source (S T ) and target (K) index set, J 1 (ξ</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">(k) i ) is the classification cost: J 1 (ξ (k) i ) = m(K) i=1 ξ (K) i + λ 0 k∈S T m(k) i=1 ξ (k) i (15)</formula><p>with λ 0 as the importance weight of the source tasks, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">J 2 (ω 0 , v k ) = λ 1 K t∈S T ∪{K} v k 2 + λ 2 ω 0 2<label>(16)</label></formula><p>is the regularization term to avoid overfitting. There are two trade-offs in this formula:</p><p>• Source vs. target tasks</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individuality vs. conformity</head><p>The individuality vs. conformity trade-off effectively controls the amount of knowledge transfer across tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In fact, setting λ 1 /λ 2 → ∞ would correspond to learning tasks independently, or no knowledge transfer, and setting λ 1 /λ 2 → 0 would result in learning a single model, or transfer all knowledge.</p><p>New in this study, the source vs. target trade-off recognizes the relative importance of learning the target task well, as compared to the source, by setting λ 0 &lt; 1. Since the target dataset is usually smaller than the source dataset, this avoids the target from being overwhelmed, and can further improve the performance. The principles of this tradeoff is illustrated in § 4.</p><p>The common and individual models of (P1), ω * 0 and v * k , are related as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">Lemma 3.7.

According to Proposition 3.8, we can use the popular SVM solvers, e.g., LibSVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, to tackle the TL problem. Also, we can extend the proposition to nonlinear SVM by "lifting" Φ(x, t) to higher, even infinite, dimensions, which corresponds to various kernels, e.g., radial basis and sigmoid, in the dual formulations. In the experimental section, we will illustrate the empirical rules for selecting µ, and our strategy to implement λ 0 for the source-target trade-off.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Power Features Exploration</head><p>The key question resolved in this section is: which features based on power usage are the most indicative of occupancy? We motivate the exploration by observing the power traces in tandem with the occupancy information for residential and commercial buildings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</p><p>Although the presence of occupants generally means a higher power usage, it is not uncommon for occupants to leave their computers on while they are out of office. In the next section, power features are designed based on power magnitude, transition, and transient effects. We also investigate how the length of aggregation window and the electricity sampling rates influence the separability of these features. Throughout this section, x i is used to denote real power measurement at time index i.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Power Magnitude</head><p>When people are in their homes or offices, they tend to use more devices, such as computers, televisions, microwaves, and lights than when they are absent. This indicates that the distributions of power magnitudes, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, are distinct for the states of occupancy and vacancy.</p><p>Specifically, the mean of the distribution for occupancy is higher than the mean for the vacancy, and it also has more spreads over the spectrum due to the variety of devices used. Additionally, there are more high power samples due to devices like microwaves, kettles, blenders, etc., that consume a large amount of power in a short period of time.</p><p>The overlap between the two distributions can be attributed to two factors. One, there are devices such as televisions that are in stand-by modes, or devices such as refrigerators that are always on regardless of human presence. Two, individuals forget to turn off devices such as computers, lights, and HVAC when they leave the rooms, resulting in energy waste. Clearly, features that look beyond power magnitudes are required to distinguish occupancy presence and absence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Transition Effect</head><p>The basic learning problem is described by (l, D, F, e n ), where l : Y × Y → R is the loss function to penalize misdetection, e.g., the 0-1 loss l 01 (y, f (x)) = 1(y = f (x)), which evaluates to 1 if the two arguments differ and 0 otherwise.</p><p>A reliable indication of human presence is when individuals switch devices ON or OFF, causing an abrupt change in power consumption. This transition effect has been used for non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) to disaggregate devices from power measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Also, change-point detection methods in time series also analyze the divergence of distributions to signal transitions in states.</p><p>The transition effect is characterized by the following features:</p><p>• Maximum absolute change (MAC):</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">δ M AC = max i,j∈S d |x i -x j |<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where S d is the set of points with window size d.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Counts of ON/OFF events (SOF), δ SOF , is the number of events such that: the change of power |x i -x i-1 | is greater than δ p , and no such changes occur in the next δ t period.</p><p>Distribution of MAC is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, which illustrates separability in the new dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Transient Effect</head><p>Apart from transitions that happen infrequently, a critical observation from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> is that despite the high power level, there are much fewer "spikes" and "ripples" during human absence. One plausible explanation is that when devices, such as computers, are in active use, they frequently switch among several modes, i.e., browsing, simulation, and word processing. Compared to the stand-by mode with a constant power need, these various modes have different power needs.</p><p>Features are designed to capture the transient effect:</p><p>• Mean of absolute difference (MAD):</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">δ M AD = 1 d i∈S d |x i -x i-1 |<label>(20)</label></formula><p>• Mean of absolute height difference (MAHD):</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">δ M AHD = 1 |C d | (i,j)∈C d |x i -x j |<label>(21)</label></formula><p>• Standard deviation (SD):</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">δ SD = 1 d -1 i∈S d (x i -x) 2<label>(22)</label></formula><p>where C d = {(i, j)|x monotone between i, j, i &lt; j ∈ S d }, and x = 1 d i∈S d x i is the average power. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the distributions of δ M AD and δ SD achieve good feature separability. Although it illustrates the active/inactive device usage, this information indirectly relates to occupant presence, requiring corroboration with other features for the occupancy inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.4">Window Effect</head><p>The "window" mentioned above is used to aggregate a chunk of data to calculate features. The choice of window size, d, depends on two independent factors: the time resolution of occupancy detection, and the separability of obtained features. Although many authors use the former to determine window size <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the latter is critical to detection performance, and should be studied systematically.</p><p>The more separable the feature, the easier it is to classify <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Several divergence metrics for distributions have been employed to measure feature separability, including the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, Hellinger distance (HD), total variation (TV) distance, and Bhattacharyya distance (BD). These definitions are provided in the appendix. For these metrics, larger values indicate that the features are more effective in distinguishing between occupancy and vacancy states, key to the detection accuracy.</p><p>While average power is generally insensitive to window size, other features that characterize the transition and transient effects are more sensitive to window size and have better qualities as the window expands, assuming the same sampling rates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Since occupancy resolution decreases for large windows, a sampling rate of 1 sample per minute during the 15 minutes period (i.e., 15 aggregated data points) seems to be a good trade-off. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.5">Sampling Effect</head><p>The sampling rate refers to how frequently power is monitored. While the window size determines the span of information to investigate, the sampling rate controls the density of data to collect. Higher sampling rate means denser sample time data. Data collected at higher rates usually reveal more information, e.g., the use of high frequency monitoring for power disaggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. But, it also introduces redundancy, especially for the detection of occupancy that typically changes slowly. There are limitations to data storage and transmission bandwidth, as well as trade-offs between privacy and detection resolution at different sampling rates.</p><p>Using the divergence metrics, we investigate the separability of the features as we increase the sampling intervals, with a fixed window size of 30 minutes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Although the power average feature seems to be relatively robust when sampling rates decrease, the MAD feature becomes less effective in distinguishing between presence and absence states. This phenomenon can be observed from the diminishing divergence metrics. In general, features that describe the transition and transient effects are most impacted by a sparse power usage request, leaving out valuable temporal information as a result. The sampling frequency is 1 sample per second for the ECO <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and UMass Smart* <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> datasets, and 1 sample per minute for the PC <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> dataset used for evaluation. In practice, it is sufficient to capture the transition and transient effects with 1 minute sampling interval. </p></div>

Radio modules, controlled by Arduino microprocessors, implement the ZigBee networking protocol for data transmission (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). Measurements can be processed by simple thresholding for presence inference.</p><p>Acceleration sensors, attached to the chairs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), detects presence by sensing chair motions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1.</head><p>Power can be used to infer occupancy.</p><p>First, we verify this hypothesis using simple thresholding methods. Then, we demonstrate in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> for PC and ECO that the accuracy improves with more advanced classifiers such as J48 decision tree and random forest.</p><p>Power thresholds are based on magnitudes (Mag/Th), changes in power magnitude (Chg/Th), and changes in percentage (Prc/Th), where the thresholds can be optimized over the training set, as detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. We also used the static schedule as the baseline, which indicates occupancy or  vacancy from 8am to 6pm for the PC or ECO, and vacancy or occupancy for the rest of the day.</p><p>Our findings show that power thresholding can achieve basic inference. As for accuracy of power features, Mag/Th is more suitable for PC and Prc/Th is more suitable for ECO. As PC has a few devices such as computers and desk lamps that are turned on or off when individuals arrive or leave their offices, Mag/Th are sound indicators of occupancy. As ECO has loads that are in stand-by modes even during individuals' absence, Mag/Th is not a suitable indicator. Since some devices such as microwaves, kettles, that draw high instantaneous power during individuals' presence, Prc/Th are strong indicators for occupancy. Since the households follow regular occupancy patterns, the static baseline produces effective results, and even outperforms the power thresholding methods in ECO.</p><p>The advanced classifiers, especially SVM, random forest, and J48 decision tree, seem to outperform the baseline methods for overall accuracy, true negative rates (TNR) for accurate vacancy inference, and true positive rates (TPR) for correct occupancy inference. Due to devices in standby modes and devices with auto-triggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the advanced classifiers' performance is slightly worse for ECO. However, the experimental results clearly show that power is a reliable indicator for occupancy. Hypothesis 2. Inference accuracy is limited by training sample size, and improves as more data is available.</p><p>To evaluate this hypothesis, we show the relationship between the inference accuracy for well-performing classifiers and training data size in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>. The graph illustrates that the classifiers' accuracy improves rapidly and reaches the upper limit with 5% or more training data. However, as the training data size falls below 5%, or 1 to 4 days of occupancy data, the classifiers' accuracy deteriorates significantly. The key problem is that while the learner can have a reasonable estimate of the power-occupancy correspondence with 5% of data, it seems difficult for the learner to generalize the learning instances with 1% or less data. But, if we can train a well-performing classifier with only 1% or less data, more than 80% of the survey effort can be saved for the user. In the next section, we will explore this extreme data sparsity regime, or NL and TL problems. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Non-Intrusive Learning Results</head><p>While the previous section discusses occupant presence detection using readily available energy data, this section examines the following hypothesis: Results for PC and ECO are reported in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref> for MIT, unbiased loss (U. L., ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">9</ref>)), and γ-weighted loss (10). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref>Generally, all methods deliver satisfactory performances compared to the static schedule. However, due to the variability in the occupancy and device usage, ECO is more challenging than PC. According to TNR and TPR, the γweighted loss seems to be a better absence detector, and unbiased loss excels at presence detection. Similar to BL results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>), the TNR/TPR rates report for ECO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>) indicates that the NL methods have  relatively low TNR, or more mistakes when the households are vacant. This is mainly due to: (1) user behavior -sometimes the power consumption is high or has considerable fluctuations despite user absence, (2) the balance of dataset -users in some ECO households tend to be present in late mornings or early afternoons, as shown in the example traces (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref>), resulting in more instances of occupancy than vacancy data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. While (1) illustrates the fundamental limitation in the proposed approach, or the difficulty in using only power data to indicate user presence or absence due to similar consumption patterns, (2) can be resolved by using existing methods such as putting a larger penalty on vacancy misclassification <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> to improve the TNR performance.</p><p>We employ the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> as a balanced measure of the prediction quality to overcome the difficulties in comparing different sizes of positive and negative instances:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">M CC = T P × T N -F P × F N (T P + F P )(T P + F N )(T N + F P )(T N + F N )</formula><p>where T P, T N, F P, F N are the numbers of true positive, true negative, false positive (ground truth: vacancy, estimation: occupancy), and false negative (ground truth: occupancy, estimation: vacancy) instances. The MCC returns a value between -1 and +1: a coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, a coefficient of 0 represents no better than random prediction, and a coefficient of -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation. Overall, the proposed NL methods significantly outperform the baseline models in the PC dataset, but only slightly outdo the baseline models in the ECO dataset. The latter is likely caused by a lack of substantial discrepancy of power characteristics between occupancy and vacancy states in the residential buildings of ECO. Based on the PC results which measure the plugloads in an office cubicle, further improvements can be achieved by sensor fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or submetering key devices such as plugloads or lighting systems.</p><p>1536-1233 (c) 2016 IEEE.

Examples of occupancy detection in time series are demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref>. This data suggests that the detectors base their occupancy determinations on power magnitudes as well as transition and transient effects. Compared to thresholding methods, the γ-weighted loss is more effective in occupancy detection, especially for the ECO dataset with periodic power surges and diversified device usage patterns. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>, hypothesis 3 is further verified. Closely following the ground truth, the learned occupancy schedule outperforms the common template for occupancy detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Transfer Learning Results</head><p>As depicted in Scenario 2 in § 1, the TL problem is due to limited data from new individuals, or target, and abundant data from similar individuals, or source. The following hypothesis resolves this data imbalance: Hypothesis 4. Occupancy detection for the target can be improved by incorporating data from the source.</p><p>Proposed in § 3.3, the model consists of common and individual components, and the solution is developed by solving the optimization program (P1). The source-target tradeoff parameter is set to balance the number of samples in the two sets (e.g., if there are n S and n T samples in the source and target, respectively, then λ 0 = n S /n T ). While the conformity-individuality parameter µ is usually set at 0 to 2, a lower value encourages more transfer for conformity.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">17</ref>, results of TL applied to ECO is reported as ECO is more challenging and relevant due to the prevalence of smart meters in homes. The schemes of Transfer A and B refer to the inclusion of one home as the source dataset (e.g., r1 as the source for r2 to r5, and r3 as the source for r1), or all other homes except for the target as the source dataset (e.g., r1 to r4 for target r5). Standard SVM performs poorly with only 1% of training data, which amounts to 30 to 70 randomly sampled points, with each sample representing 15 minutes occupancy/vacancy state. It is promising to note that due to abundant training data, both transfer schemes are highly accurate. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">17</ref>: TL results when only 1% of target dataset is available, averaged over 100 independent trials. While the hypothesis presumes knowledge transfer from "similar" individuals, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">16</ref> illustrates that this requirement is far from stringent. Even though the source's occupancy schedule is very different from the target's schedule, the results of learning with transfer from source data is more favorable than the results of no transfer.</p><p>Further, we demonstrate TL's capability by transferring knowledge across two publicly available datasets (Transfer scheme C). Specifically, from the Smart* dataset reported by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we use two households' power usage information during the summer (Home A and B) to predict occupancy for homes in the ECO dataset. While the house-   <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, showing the overall accuracy metric. While the best performance in BL is bolded, the best performances in NL and TL are underlined.</p><p>holds in Smart* and ECO differ in geographical locations and home sizes, they share similar energy consumption patterns. This is verified by the JS divergence metrics for power features conditioned on the presence/absence states within and across datasets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">18</ref>). Transfer scheme C's performance is on par with schemes A and B in terms of the overall accuracy and MCC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">17</ref>). The learned occupancy schedule for r3 in ECO is closer to the ground truth due to the similarity with the homes in Smart* (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">16</ref>). The results indicate tangible benefits to preselecting sources for TL by segmenting customer energy consumption data <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Comparison with Prior Art</head><p>We compare the best results from previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> that also use the ECO and Smart* datasets for evaluation. For BL, the methods include hidden Markov model (HMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, HMM-PCA, and SVM-PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which use principal component analysis (PCA) for feature selections. For NL, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed a threshold-based nonintrusive occupancy monitoring (NIOM) algorithm, which assumes constant presence during nighttime, and then clusters the occupancy based on the deviation from nighttime power features. One drawback with this approach is that the nighttime power usage used to set the thresholds may not be an accurate indicator for occupancy. We address this problem by two distinct ideas: MIT uses a rough occupancy schedule to initialize the data, and then refines the labels by exploiting the power information; the surrogate loss methods recognize the noisy labels in initialized data, and customize loss functions to reduce the adverse effects.</p><p>Due to a lack of previous work that also use the ECO and Smart* datasets, we reported our TL results without a comparison. The evaluation procedures for transfer B and C are reported in § 4.4. Since there are only 7 days of data for each household in Smart*, we randomly selected 10% of the target data, or less than one day of training effort, and combined it with data from households (r1 to r3) in ECO for training.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> indicates that the random forest has the highest overall accuracy among all competitors in BL. The unbiased surrogate loss (U.L.) outperforms NIOM for Home A (84% vs. 79% accuracy), but slightly underperforms for Home B (89% vs. 91%). However, it remains consistently competitive for ECO compared to MIT and γ-weighted surrogate loss method. TL within the same dataset (Tran. B) seems to be more efficient than TL across two datasets (Tran. C). Overall, both TL performances are satisfactory due to the transfer of shared patterns.</p></div>

As for occupancy detection, on the one end of the spectrum are the more specialized but reliable devices such as PIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, magnetic reed switches <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> , cameras <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, telephone handset sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, network logins and GPS trackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, active RFID badges <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and smart phones <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. On the other end of the spectrum are the mechanisms that safeguard user privacy but are more error-prone, such as models based on environmental measurements, including temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, CO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, particulate matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and ultrasonic chirps <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Concerns for practical implementations often include system cost, faulty installations, maintenance, and required training period.</p><p>Energy Data Mining. The analysis of electricity data has been conducted to cluster households <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> to estimate socio-economic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, identify usage patterns for prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, and provide tailor-made information to the families <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. LBNL used ACme system to measure a large building space and demonstrated reliable performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), pioneered by Hart <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, has also been popular. It infers device-level ON/OFF states from the aggregate signal based on various power features <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Power for Occupancy Detection. Molina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> demonstrated the capability of power for occupancy detection through visual inspection, while Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and Kleiminger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> quantitatively assessed the results of using power for occupancy detection. Kleiminger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> subsequently reported improvement from 82% to 90% for the ECO dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> based on a comprehensive set of features from three power phases, which were processed by feature selection and principal component analysis (PCA). Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> also experimented with a range of classifiers, such as random forest, decision tree, multilayer perceptron, using the Weka Machine Learning Toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>BL in § 3.1 is conducted in a similar fashion as BL in the antecedent literature as baselines. However, the major difference is our solution to the data scarcity problem, or NL, as an extension of our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which carries out learning without collecting presence data, and TL, which exploits the potential for improvement by incorporating data from other sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Occupancy detection for residential and commercial buildings alike is crucial to improving energy efficiency, user comfort, and space utility. The pervasiveness of electricity meters eliminates the additional system cost and setup/maintenance efforts. Hence, electricity meters are viable candidates for presence sensing, with the added benefits of safeguarding privacy information (compared to cameras), and improving reliability (compared to environmental measurements).</p><p>The potential of energy meters is thoroughly explored by studying data from both residential (ECO and Smart*) and commercial (PC) buildings. Various power features, e.g., magnitude, MAC, SOF, MAD, SD, are investigated. The capability of power for presence detection is first demonstrated in BL with methods like SVM and random forest. For non-intrusive learning without training data of occupancy, or NL, the proposed multiview-based iteration and surrogate loss approaches use common schedules as rough estimates to learn refined ones that are much closer to the ground truth. As a result, accuracy rates are 74 to 89% for residential buildings and about 90% for offices. TL approach tackles the case when data from other sources are used in the current learning task. Its results further confirm the appropriateness of using power to detect occupancy by producing superior performance as compared to standard SVM.</p><p>For the future work, it will be meaningful to extend NL and TL from indicating occupancy (classification) to estimating the number of people (regression). Additionally, it will be promising to perform sensor fusion with other mobile nodes, such as smart phones, fitness trackers, and automobiles, for further improvement. Last but not least, as shown in this paper's inferences, smart meters can be used to infer various user characteristics, raising the important issue of preserving user privacy while maintaining system functions, which are worth exploring.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2: Typical daily power consumption of an occupant in a commercial building (left) and in a household (right).
