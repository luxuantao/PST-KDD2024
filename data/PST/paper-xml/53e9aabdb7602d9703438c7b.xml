<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>High-performance cell-based communications networks including ATM have been conceived to carry asynchronous traffic sources and support a continuum of transport rates ranging from low bit-rate to high bit-rate traffic. When a number of bursty traffic sources add cells, the network is inevitably subject to congestion. 'haditional approaches to congestion management include admission control algorithms, smoothing functions, and the use of finite-sized buffers with queue management techniques. Most queue management schemes, reported in the literature, utilize '%xed" thresholds, i.e., either binary or a limited number of predetermined values based on the cell priorities, to determine when to permit or refuse entry of cells into the buffer. The aim is to achieve a desired tradeoff between the number of cells carried through the network, propagation delays of the cells, and the number of discarded cells. While binary thresholds are excessively restrictive, the rationale underlying the use of a large number of priorities appears to be ad hoc, unnatural, and unclear. This paper introduces, perhaps for the first time, the notion of cell-blocking, wherein a fuzzy thresholding function, based on Zadeh's fuzzy set theory, is utilized to deliberately refuse entry to a fraction of incoming cells from other switches. The blocked cells must be rerouted by the sending switch to other switches and, in the process, they may incur delays. The fraction of blocked cells is a continuous function of the current buffer occupancy level unlike the abrupt, discrete thresholds in the traditional approaches. The fuzzy cell-blocking scheme is simulated on a computer and the simulation results for a given, realistic traffic stimulus, characterized by Poisson arrivals and exponentially distributed departures, are contrasted against those from the traditional approach. A comparative analysis reveals that fuzzy queue management adapts superbly to sharp changes in cell arrival rates and maximum burstiness of bursty traffic sources, yielding lower cell discard rates, high throughput of cells through the network, and lower cellblocking rates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>transport mechanism. ATM provides a flexible means for I ) supporting a continuum of transport rates, ranging from low bit-rate to high bit-rate traffic, 2) asynchronous traffic sources, and 3) also offers a potential efficiency improvement over synchronous transfer alternatives through the statistical sharing of network resources. Given that cell-switching technologies such as ATM are expected to efficiently support "bursty" traffic sources such as interactive data and compressed video images, the dynamic nature of bursty traffic, i.e., cells <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> generated at near-peak rate for a while followed by zero cell generation, may cause severe network congestion. To address this problem, switches often utilize one or more of the following approaches: admission control algorithms [ 31, smoothing functions [4], and finite-sized buffers with queue management techniques.</p><p>In admission control, upon arrival of a new call or message, a network predicts the performance degradation that may result, based on the current network traffic and the traffic characteristics of the new call, and accepts the call only when the desired performance requirement is met. The admission control policy accepts or rejects an entire call or message as opposed to the individual cells of the call. This policy is especially relevant to broadband-ISDN networks, where the concept of virtual paths and virtual channels treats a call or message as the basic transfer unit, and requires that every cell of the call be routed along a prescribed route.</p><p>The traffic smoothing function is an effort to reduce the adverse impact of burstiness on congestion. It is achieved through either an access control at the user network interface or at a data source, by buffering and injecting cells into the network at a slower speed [5]. The smoothing function may be guided either by the desire to conform to a given traffic rate, endto-end acknowledgment, or end-to-end acknowledgment with congestion feedback [6]. The invocation of both admission control and a smoothing function is not necessarily contingent on the performance prediction. The smoothing function applies primarily to the admittance of new cells from the external user, and not cells that are forwarded to a switching node from other switching nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Queue Management</head><p>The use of finite-sized buffers and queue management algorithms serves to strike an efficient balance between the network throughput, i.e., the number of cells that are propagated 10636692/94$04.00 0 1994 IEEE through the network without being dropped, and the network performance, i.e., the delay incurred in propagating the cells to their destinations. When either a bursty traffic source or an abrupt network link failure causes excessive cells to be asserted at a switching node, the buffer provides temporary storage for the cells until the network recovers. A number of algorithms and control schemes have been proposed for queue management in ATM networks <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. For example, Sumita <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> proposes an analytical technique to synthesize control schemes for output buffer management. The objective is to determine desired buffer capacity and a queuing scheme to satisfy both delay and loss probability constraints. The synthesis is based on a conservation law for MIDI1 finite capacity queues and assumes a "nonblocking" switching network, i.e., packet loss may occur at the input or output buffer. Although the analytic model assumes Poisson arrivals of traffic cells, this scheme is limited in that input traffic is assumed to be nonbursty.</p><p>Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposes a new analytic model for overload control in finite message storage buffers, and shows that the queue length distribution is significantly improved and call-blocking probability significantly reduced by permitting a small fraction of packet loss.</p><p>Chao [ 101 proposes a queue management architecture for ATM-based broadband-ISDN networks. As in other approaches, traffic cells are assigned priorities, with higher priorities reserved for real-time traffic such as voice and video (due to strict delay requirements), and lower priorities assigned to data traffic. The higher priority cells are always propagated to the output before the lower priority cells, and low-priority cells are discarded when the queue is full. For competing cells of the same priority, Chao proposes the use of "departure sequence (DS)" numbers to prevent interference. A cell's DS number is assigned based on the arrival time of the first cell of the connection and the average arrival rate of the connection. Eckberg, Luan, and Lucantoni [ 1 I] propose a "core" network congestion control termed "bandwidth management," that consists of selectively tagging cells that correspond to excessive traffic and discarding them when and where congestion is encountered. Yin, Li, and Stem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> classify voice packets for ATM Voice networks into class 1 (more significant) and class 2 (less significant), determine the onset of congestion, and invoke the appropriate congestion control. Where the number of cells in "talkspurt" exceed a predetermined threshold, incoming class 2 packets are discarded. When the queue length in the multiplexer buffer exceeds a preset value, class 2 cells already in the queue are also discarded.</p><p>Petr and Frost [ 131 propose a scheme for buffer management in ATM-based broadband-ISDN networks wherein ATM cells are assigned "delivery" priority as opposed to "service" priority, and cells are rejected based on an optimal discarding policy that depends on the state of the queue and a known cost function. Their approach assumes a single, small buffer which is divided into two g r o u p s 4 n e to hold packets waiting for service while the other temporarily holds cells that may be discarded at the end of the service interval. Their results indicate that to accommodate future higher priority arrivals, it is necessary to discard lower priority packets even when there is sufficient buffer space available. In the broadband-ISDN simulator reported by Chai and Ghosh [14], every cell is initially stamped with the time of its arrival at a switching node. Although the switch attempts to propagate every cell to the appropriate output channel as soon as possible, conceivably a cell may be stored in the buffer longer when the appropriate output channel is not available. The resulting delay is added to the cumulative delay of the cell and, when the latter exceeds a prescribed limit defined for a specific traffic class, the cell may be dropped. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B . The Use of Thresholds and Their Limitations</head><p>In addition to the use of priorities, predefined buffer content thresholds are also utilized to guide the discarding of cells and adapt the service process to the state (e.g., occupancy) of the buffer. The definition and selection of thresholds is especially critical to overload control schemes. For example, Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> defines an overload period equal to the time period where the buffer content exceeds a level L2 until it drops to a level L I .</p><p>The overload control acts during this time, and is intended to reduce the recurrence of system shutdown periods, and protect high priority messages against low ones. Petr and Frost</p><p>[15] assume that the constraints on cell loss probabilities are specified, and then deduce a number of threshold values to be assigned to the cells. This is referred to as a "nested threshold" structure, in which each priority class has its own discard level. When a cell of a given discarding priority arrives, first the threshold corresponding to that priority is compared with the queue fill at that instant. Where the queue fill exceeds the threshold, the cell is discarded, otherwise it is admitted to the queue. Clearly, the discard policy is completely specified by the set of chosen thresholds, a fact which necessitates either efficient search techniques for determining an "optimal" set of thresholds for a given load and cell loss constraints, or the development of altemative strategies based on "softer," more robust thresholds. Ye and Li [7][16] propose to limit the excessive arrival rate of traffic cells when the buffer size exceeds a given level. In addition, ATM cells are classified and dropped based on their significance. Analytical studies indicate a noticeable drop in the probability of blocking states, (i.e., queue full), as a direct consequence of this type of "hybrid" strategy.</p><p>In summary, queue management schemes without cell discard are able to remove short blocking periods associated with low packet loss rates but are ineffective for longer blocking periods associated with high packet loss rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Even those schemes that utilize cell priorities and thresholds to determine cell discard (or admission) suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, such schemes are generally unable to accurately and dynamically determine effective threshold settings. The second limitation is more generic. The rationale and principles underlying the choice and nature of thresholds under uncertain dynamic conditions is unclear. Given the dynamic nature of queues and congestion in cellswitching networks, the reliance on thresholds in every aspect of network management and the distinct nature of uncertainty in the networking domain, this paper explores an alternative approach to queue management based on fuzzy thresholds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C . Fuzzy Modeling</head><p>Fuzzy modeling promises to offer a rich language for queue management by providing soft thresholds, characterizing imprecise quantities (e.g., buffer occupancy), and capturing linguistic, rule-based control strategies. This paper applies fuzzy modeling techniques that are based on Zadeh's fuzzy set theory 1171, which provides a robust mathematical framework for dealing with "real-world" imprecision and non-statistical uncertainty. As a departure from classical two-valued sets and logic, fuzzy models use "soft" linguistic (e.g., buffer too full, buffer nearly full, buffer somewhat full, buffer somewhat empty, buffer nearly empty, etc.) system variables and a continuous range of truth values in the interval 0 , l . For excellent introductions to fuzzy systems and computing with uncertainty, the reader is referred to [18], <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Fuzzy rule-based systems combine fuzzy sets and linguistic variables with rules and inferencing. From the perspective of artificial intelligence, these fuzzy systems, often termed "fuzzy logic," are a natural complement to neural networks and expert systems, by efficiently combining structured knowledge within a numerical framework. Fuzzy logic has proven effective in a number of applications such as intelligent control and decision support, especially where a system is difficult to characterize and has strict implementation constraints. In the fields of telecommunications, network management, and queuing theory, fuzzy models have been applied andlor proposed in a number of areas. <ref type="bibr">Holtzman [20]</ref> discusses the use of fuzzy approaches in the forecasting of future telecommunications services, and in modeling aspects of uncertainty in broadband traffic. <ref type="bibr">Millstrom,</ref><ref type="bibr">Bonde,</ref><ref type="bibr">and Grimaldi [21]</ref> propose a unique hybrid architecture for automated VHF frequency management that applies fuzzy logic for enhanced signal detection and decision-making. Two applications of fuzzy modeling techniques to network troubleshooting systems are described by Lirov <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[22]</ref> and Lewis and Dreo <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>.</p><p>This paper is motivated by the success of these applications and other work in qualitative and natural language simulation [24] and modeling queuing systems 1251, [26] through fuzzy techniques. Both <ref type="bibr">Prade [26]</ref> and Li and Lee <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> stress that in practical situations, the mean of the arrival rate (represented by A) and the mean service rate (represented by v) are frequently fuzzy, i.e., they cannot be expressed in exact terms. Also, the service rules are often imprecise given the presence of illstated exceptions and perturbations. However, neither hade nor Li and Lee extend their analyses to the issues of queue management.</p><p>This paper aims to investigate a fundamental issue: the underlying principles that either refuse or permit the entry of transit [31] cells, i.e., from other switches, to the switch buffer, from the perspective of fuzzy modeling and thresholds. It then aims to contrast the findings against those from the traditional usage of thresholds. This paper hypothesizes that fuzzy thresholds will cause the buffer queue to exhibit "soft" behavior, i.e., greater ability to adapt to dynamic conditions, as opposed to the traditional, inflexible, binary thresholds. It also hypothesizes that fuzzy thresholds will exhibit robustness, such as resilience to rapid dynamic changes in network traffic and favorably impact cell discarding. This paper argues that binary thresholds are excessively restrictive. While the use of priorities has been proposed to address that limitation, it raises two additional problems. First, priorities constitute an ad hoc solution to the problem and themselves rely on thresholding. Second, the rationale underlying the assignment of a large number of priorities to cells is unclear. For a fair comparison between the fixed and fuzzy threshold schemes, this paper tentatively ignores the use of priorities. This paper assumes that although the cells of a call or message may be initially asserted to the network as a basic unit, in the course of propagation through the network, the individual cells of the message may be propagated via different routes.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I1 introduces the notion of cell-blocking and contrasts fuzzy threshold against fixed threshold schemes. Section I11 details the design of experiments to evaluate and contrast the two schemes. The experiments are simulated on a computer and the simulation results are analyzed to estimate the impact of the schemes on the performance of the cell-switching network. Finally, Section IV presents conclusions and plans for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">CELL-BLOCKING STRATEGIES</head><p>The traditional notion of blocking 1271, defined in the context of circuit switched telephone networks, refers to the scenario when a telephone call cannot be completed due to resource limitations. Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[28]</ref> extends the notion of blocking to refer to the queue-full scenario when ATM voice packets are blocked. In contrast to this classical view of blocking as a negative artifact of queue management, this paper introduces the notion of selective cell-blocking, where a switch, utilizing certain criteria and under specified conditions, deliberately refuses entry to one or more cells from a source switch, as opposed to all cells of a specific message, into the buffer queue. In this paper, a message consists of a number of individual cell-bursts where a cell-burst contains a variable number of cells. Where a cell-burst from a source switch, consisting of "N" cells, desires entry into a switch buffer, the switch may selectively block or admit this cell-burst or a fraction of the " N " cells. The remainder of the " N " cells must be routed by the source switch to another destination switch and, in the process, these cells may incur delays. In this spirit, the notion of cell-blocking combines potentially useful elements of both admission control and smoothing functions.</p><p>It may be observed that selective cell-blocking impacts the traditional view of virtual circuits. In particular, ATM networks, standardized for broadband-ISDN [32], utilize a virtual-circuit connection-oriented switched architecture. This paper proposes to expand the scope of the standard ATM architecture to include a selective cell-blocking option. Evidently, this feature implies some level of message fragmentation, may require the system to reorder cells at the destination, and raises the issue of algorithms to route blocked cells. However, given the focus on thresholding, these issues, as well as the extent and impact of fragmentation, are beyond the scope of this paper and will be the subject of a future investigation.</p><p>The threshold function determines, for each cell-burst, how many of the arriving cells to admit into the buffer. This function bears significant influence on the performance of the network including the fraction of cells lost due to dropping or excessive delays and the delay distribution of the cells. The traditional "fixed" scheme utilizes a binary threshold: admit or no-admit, depending on the occupancy of the buffer. In the fuzzy scheme, the admittance and no-admittance decision is based on a continuous threshold function, detailed subsequently. In both cases. admission or refusal to admit cells is expressed by a simple control rule: if (buffer is getting FULL) else admit incoming cells refuse admittance to incoming cells For both "fixed" and fuzzy schemes, only those cells that are already in the buffer are subject to being dropped when the buffer overflows. Conceivably, the choice of thresholds, relative to the maximum burst rate, in both schemes may be such that no cell is ever dropped. Such choices, however, are observed to constitute either poor buffer utilization or cause inefficient delays due to increased routing.</p><p>The dual issues of defining "getting FULL" and the manner in which it leads to a blocking decision are addressed in Sections 11-A and -B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Fi.ved Thi.r.sholcls</head><p>The concept of fixed thresholds is not new <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, [15] and is described here only for the purpose of contrasting it with the use of fuzzy thresholding functions. In general, the choice of a threshold directly impacts the balance between the network throughput, i.e.. the number of cells that are propagated through the network without being dropped, and the network performance, i.e., the delay incurred in propagating the cells to their destinations. For binary thresholds, this choice is especially critical since the choice is represented through a single value. For a very "conservative" choice, i.e., new cells are admitted only when the buffer occupancy is very low, say 25% of capacity, the utilization of the buffer may be very poor. That is, the buffer although largely unfilled, will mostly reject entrance to new cells. In contrast, a "liberal" threshold, say 90% of capacity, may cause severe problems under "bursty" traffic scenario, wherein the buffer may fail to "absorb" the sudden influx of cells. The choice of binary thresholds is further aggravated by bursty traffic in two ways. By definition, a bursty traffic scenario implies that cells may be generated at near-peak rate for a while followed by zero cell generation. First, the value of the threshold must be determined a priori, i.e.. before the occurrence of the events. Events are dynamic, they occur extremely fast, and manually determining and setting threshold values before every event is impractical. Second, the number of cells asserted at a switch is dynamic and adjusting the threshold value corresponding to every event is not pragmatic. An event corresponds to the generation and assertion of a cell-burst at a switch.</p><p>The second reason also implies that the switch must use the knowledge of the maximum "burstiness," i.e., the maximum number of cells possible within a cell-burst, to determine a threshold value that eliminates cell discard. For instance, consider a 10 cell-capacity buffer with a binary threshold value of 50%. Clearly, this scheme is "safe," i.e., it will absorb a cell-burst, where the burstiness ranges from 0-5 cells. For larger cell-bursts, the buffer may overflow and discard cells. The concem for not dropping cells has inevitably injected inefficiency into the approach.</p><p>Conceptually, a binary threshold partitions the buffer into two states: admit (no block) and block, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Where the occupancy level ranges from 0 through 50% at a simulation time instant, all cells of a cell-burst are admitted. However, where the occupancy level exceeds 50%, all cell bursts are refused entry. The sharp change in the decision from admit to block for a change of occupancy level from 49 to 51%, in this approach, is very abrupt. It appears counterintuitive that the abrupt swing in the decision making for a small change in the buffer occupancy level of 2%, i.e. from 49% to 5 1 %, is realistic and logically sound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Fuzzy Thi-eshnlds</head><p>Fuzzy sets [I71 were introduced in the literature to explicitly deal with the "imprecisely defined classes" that one encounters in the real physical world, and to replace binary class assignments with continuous set membership. In this research, to develop a more realistic view of buffer occupancy and to provide a robust decision making, the Fuzzy (2,8) cell-blocking scheme: Asymmetric, continuous set memtraditional notion of "FULLness" which leads to the binary decision classes, admit and block in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, are replaced respectively with two fuzzy states-"getting FULL"</p><p>and "not getting FULL." This view features continuous set membership and implies a soft, gradual transition between completely "FULL" and completely "not FULL" (empty).</p><p>The membership values are defined through a function and specific values are represented through the symbol, ,LLFULL.</p><p>In contrast to the use of triangular or trapezoidal symmetric membership functions in many fuzzy systems, this paper utilizes an asymmetric "sigmoid" shaped membership function which, in tum, gives rise to fuzzy threshold values that depend on the occupancy level. The choice of the "sigmoid" function is appropriate since it naturally captures our own intuition of how the buffer fills up. While triangular or trapezoidal functions are definite possibilities, the sigmoid function is more expressive. At lower buffer occupancies, the value of the blocking function is small and it rises gradually, thereby granting entry to a greater fraction of incoming cells. At increasingly higher buffer occupancies, the function rises more steeply through a "transition region." At high occupancy levels, the function again rises gradually but its value is large, thereby permitting entry to a smaller fraction of incoming cells. Given that the cell-blocking strategy is expressed by a simple, single antecedent (if the buffer is getting FULL), single consequent (then block) control rule, the degree to which the buffer is full directly controls the level of cell-blocking. This simple rule results in a continuous-valued cell-blocking strategy, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. For instance, at 30% occupancy level, the value of ,LLFULL is approximately 0.1, which results in a cell-blocking value of 0.1 or 10%. That is, 10% of the amving cells would be refused entry into the buffer and they must be re-routed by the sending switch to other switches. Note that the degree of admittance given by (1-blocking) is 90%. Thus, unlike the "fixed" cell-blocking scheme, represented by a single threshold value X and expressed through "fixed at value X," the fuzzy threshold function covers a specified range of buffer occupancy values. In the remainder of the paper, while fixed cell-blocking is represented through "fixed at value X," fuzzy cell-blocking is represented by "fuzzy ( A , B)" where A and B are, respectively, the "zero-valued'' and "unit-valued'' end points. 111. PERFORMANCE OF FUZZY THRESHOLDING This section reports the design of simulation experiments to evaluate the "fixed" and fuzzy cell-blocking schemes under simulated congested traffic conditions. The measures, selected for the evaluation, include the 1) throughput, i.e., the number of cells serviced by the buffer, 2) the number of cells refused entry into the buffer, and 3) the number of cells dropped due to buffer overflow. The experiment assumes a finite-sized buffer of capacity 8 cells. Should the number of cells in the buffer equal or exceed 9, the excess cells are discarded. Otherwise, cells are not lost. The measures are obtained for 1) two sets of traffic volumes, 500 cells and 5000 cells, 2) a number of fixed blocking schemes with different values of binary thresholds at 2, 3, and 4, respectively, 3) six sets of traffic with maximum burstiness values of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively, and 4) three sets of traffic with different mean arrival rates, X = 4, X = 2, and X = 1, respectively. The mean service rate, v is assumed equal to 1.</p><p>The simulations utilize a single-server queueing model [29] with the input traffic stimulus characterized by Poisson arrivals, mean arrival rate given by A, and exponentially distributed departures, mean service rate given by v. Burstiness in the input traffic stimulus is modeled by generating a random number N between 0 and a user-specified maximum, and permitting N cells to be asserted at the buffer. The userspecified maximum is at least equal to or greater than 50% of the buffer capacity, i.e., 4. Corresponding to an event, the blocking scheme, in effect, will cause a fraction of the cells asserted to the buffer to be admitted into the queue with the remaining cells being blocked. The throughput is measured by incrementing the "service" counter each time a cell departs from the queue. The software is written in C and executed on a Macintosh IIci.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref> and<ref type="table">11</ref> record the simulation results for 500 cells, v = 1, fuzzy threshold function with end points at occupancy levels 1 cell and 7 cells respectively, and maximum burstiness values ranging from 5 through 10. Tables I and I1 present three measures: number of cells serviced, number of cells blocked, and number of cells dropped, for three fixed blocking schemes, with binary thresholds at 4, 3, and 2, respectively, and one fuzzy blocking scheme. Binary threshold choices of 5 and higher are observed to be too restrictive and are, therefore, not pursued. While Table I corresponds to faster arriving cells, given by a mean arrival rate of X = 4, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I1</ref> relates to slower arriving cells, given by X = 2. It may be noted that the total number of cells serviced, blocked, and dropped adds to slightly less than 500 in each case and this refers to a few cells that remain in the buffer at the completion of an experiment. The high percentages of blocked cells in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I1</ref> do not imply inefficiency in queue management. It merely reflects a deliberate choice of parameters to create extreme congestion and contrast the performance of the two schemes.</p><p>As expected, with an increase in the maximum burstiness from 5 through 10, the three fixed blocking schemes drop more and more cells. The loss is reduced by successively selecting conservative thresholds, from fixed at 4 to fixed at 3, to fixed at 2. At the same time, the buffer is increasingly sparsely    populated causing a decrease in the throughput, increase in blocking, and consequent increase in the delay of cells. In contrast, the fuzzy scheme appears relatively unaffected even as the maximum burstiness is increased. The fuzzy approach drops fewer cells than any of the fixed thresholds, yet achieves a level of throughput equal to the most liberal fixed blocking scheme-fixed at 4. In addition, a decrease in the traffic arrival rate, from X = 4 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>) to X = 2 (Table <ref type="table">11</ref>) is accompanied by an increase in the number of cells serviced and reduction in blocking.</p><p>To explore the trends exhibited in Tables I and I1 in greater detail, three experiments are simulated, each for a total of 5000 cells. Two maximum burstiness values are utilized-nominal, represented by value 5, and the extreme case, represented by value 8. Tables 111-V record the simulation results for three scenarios-fuzzy (1,7), fixed at 3, and fixed at 2, and correspond respectively to arrival rates given by X = 4, X = 2, and X = 1. It may be observed that the fuzzy (1,7) scheme exhibits higher throughput, lower blocking, and reduced cell discard, relative to the fixed blocking schemes. In 17 of the 18 experiments, fuzzy (1,7) scheme results in fewer cell discards. As expected, a decrease in the cell arrival rate, from X = 4 to X = 2 to X = 1 is associated with increased number of cells serviced and reduced number of cells blocked.</p><p>Clearly, within the scope of the experiments, the fuzzy cellblocking scheme appears to adapt better than traditional, fixed, cell-blocking schemes to changes in maximum burstiness, cell arrival rates, and traffic volume.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> presents a graphical view of buffer occupancy, blocking function, and cell arrivals, as functions of simulation time, for a limited length of the entire simulation run. The schemes presented include fuzzy (1,7) and fixed at 3. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c</ref>) represents the stochastic distribution of the discrete number of cells asserted to the buffer. For this given distribution, unlike the graph corresponding to fixed blocking in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref> which reveals sharp spikes, the graph corresponding to fuzzy blocking varies much less abruptly. In contrast, the fixed blocking scheme only admits cells if the buffer occupancy is less than three, and "oscillates" abruptly, causing both overflow and missed service opportunities. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a) reveals instances of cell discard where the graph corresponding to fixed blocking equals 9. Also shown on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a</ref>) is an instance of missed service when the occupancy, for the case of fixed blocking, falls to 0 just prior to a service time. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b)</ref> presents the variation of the blocking function values, as a function of simulation time, for the fuzzy and fixed at 3 schemes. Once again, while the graph for fixed blocking swings abruptly between 0 and 1, that for fuzzy blocking varies relatively more smoothly. The observed superior performance of the fuzzy scheme agrees with common intuition. The fuzzy scheme more naturally captures the notion of fullness through the continuous-valued blocking function control. IV. CONCLUSIONS High performance cell-based communications networks including ATM have been conceived to carry asynchronous traffic sources and support a continuum of transport rates ranging from low bit-rate to high bit-rate traffic. When a number of bursty traffic sources add cells, the network is inevitably subject to congestion. Traditional approaches to congestion management include admission control algorithms, smoothing functions, and the use of finite-sized buffers with queue management techniques. Most queue management schemes, reported in the literature, utilize "fixed" thresholds, i.e., either binary or a limited number of predetermined values based on the cell priorities, to determine when to permit or refuse entry of cells into the buffer. The aim is to achieve a desired tradeoff between the number of cells carried through the network, propagation delays of the cells, and the number of discarded cells. While binary thresholds are excessively restrictive, the rationale underlying the use of a large number of priorities appears to be ad hoc, unnatural, and unclear. This paper has introduced the notion of cell-blocking, wherein a fuzzy thresholding function, based on Zadeh's fuzzy set theory, has been utilized to deliberately refuse entry to a fraction of incoming cells from other switches. The blocked cells must be rerouted by the sending switch to other switches and, in the process, they may incur delays. The fraction of blocked cells is a continuous function of the current buffer occupancy level unlike the abrupt, discrete thresholds in the traditional approaches. The fuzzy cell-blocking scheme has been simulated on a computer and the simulation results for a given, realistic traffic stimulus, characterized by Poisson arrivals and exponentially distributed departures, have been contrasted against those from the traditional approach. A comparative analysis has revealed that fuzzy queue management adapts superbly to sharp changes in cell arrival rates and maximum burstiness of bursty traffic sources, yielding lower cell discard rates, high throughput of cells through the network, and lower cell-blocking rates.</p><p>This paper investigates, perhaps for the first time, the potential of fuzzy mathematics towards providing flexible and high-performance solutions to queue management in cellswitching networks. The results appear quite promising, nevertheless, further study on the impact of 1) fuzzy blocking on virtual paths and 2) fuzzy thresholds on the degree of message fragmentation, are essential. Future plans include expanding the simulation to a large-scale network consisting of 50-60 switches, utilizing distributed algorithms on parallel processors. Also, the authors plan to expand the study to include more natural definitions for multiple service classes cell priorities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
