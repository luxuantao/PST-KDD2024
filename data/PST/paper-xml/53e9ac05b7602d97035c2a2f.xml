<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Byoungjo Choi and Lajos Hanzo, Senior Member, IEEE</head><p>Abstract-A set of optimum mode-switching levels is derived for a generic constant-power adaptive-modulation scheme based on a closed-form expression of the average bit error ratio (BER) and the average bits-per-symbol (BPS) throughput of the adaptive-modulation scheme. This results in a constant BER, variable-throughput arrangement. The corresponding BPS throughput performance and the achievable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain are investigated for the optimum mode-switching assisted constant-power adaptive-modulation schemes employing various diversity schemes, including maximal ratio combining (MRC) receive-antenna diversity, a two-dimensional RAKE receiver, as well as transmit-diversity aided space-time (ST) coding, when communicating over various fading scenarios. The BPS throughput of our constant-power adaptive quadrature amplitude modulation (AQAM) scheme approaches the throughput of variable-power variable-rate AQAM within 1 dB. However, the achievable throughput gain of the adaptive-modulation scheme, in comparison to conventional fixed-mode modems, is substantially reduced as the diversity order of the receiver is increased. Hence, adaptive modulation constitutes a lower complexity alternative to multiple-transmitter and receiver-based systems when considering the range of techniques that can be used for mitigating the effects of the channel-quality fluctuations imposed by wireless channels.</p><p>Index Terms-Adaptive modulation, adaptive quadrature amplitude modulation (AQAM), fading counter measures, Lagrangian optimization for adaptive modulation, optimum switching levels for adaptive modulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>M OBILE COMMUNICATIONS channels typically ex- hibit time-variant channel-quality fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and, hence, conventional fixed-mode modems suffer from bursts of transmission errors, even if the system was designed to provide a high link margin. An efficient approach to mitigating these detrimental effects is to adaptively adjust the transmission format based on the near-instantaneous channel-quality information perceived by the receiver, which is fed back to the transmitter with the aid of a feedback channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This scheme requires a reliable feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. The channel-quality variation should be sufficiently slow for the transmitter to be able to adapt. Hayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed transmission-power adaptation, while Cavers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> suggested invoking a variable symbol-duration scheme in response to the perceived channel quality at the expense of a variable bandwidth requirement. Since a variable-power scheme increases the peak level of cochannel interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> imposed on other users of the system, rather than variable bit rate but constant symbol rate, adaptive quadrature amplitude modulation (AQAM) was proposed by Steele and Webb as an alternative, while employing various star quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. With the advent of pilot symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Otsuki et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> employed maximum-minimum distance-based square constellations rather than star constellations in the context of AQAM, as a practical fading-counter measure. Analyzing the channel capacity of Rayleigh-fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Goldsmith et al.</ref> showed that variable power, variable-rate adaptive schemes are optimum, approaching the capacity of the channel and characterizing the throughput performance of variable-power AQAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, they also found that the extra throughput achieved by the additional variable-power-assisted adaptation over the constant-power variable-rate scheme is marginal for most types of fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Since the performance of the AQAM scheme is predetermined by the switching levels employed, various attempts have been made to determine the suitable switching levels. An attempt to find optimum switching levels that are capable of satisfying various transmission-integrity requirements was made by Webb and Steele <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. They used the bit error ratio (BER) curves of each constituent-modulation mode, obtained from conducted simulations when communicating over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, in order to find the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, where each modulation mode satisfies the target BER requirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This intuitive concept of determining switching levels has been widely used by researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> since then. The regime proposed by Webb and Steele can be used for ensuring that instantaneous BER always remains below a certain threshold BER . However, no direct relationship between the resultant-average BER of the corresponding adaptive modem and the peak-instantaneous BER was available. In order to generate the optimum switching levels that satisfy the target average BER, while maximizing the obtainable bits-per-symbol (BPS) throughput, Torrance and Hanzo <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed the employment of a heuristic cost function and applied Powell's optimization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The multidimensional optimization of the cost function produces a set of constant switching levels across the entire SNR range and the corresponding average BER exhibited good agreement with the desired target average BER. However, the actual average BER of the adaptive scheme was not constant across the SNR range, implying that the average throughput could potentially be increased further. Hence, a per SNR optimization scheme em- ploying a modified cost function was developed to guarantee a constant target average BER across the whole operating SNR range <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Since Powell's multidimensional optimization may be trapped in a local optimum, rather than identifying the global optimum, the previous two schemes often result in suboptimal switching levels. Recently, Paris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed a set of optimal switching thresholds based on a multidimensional optimization technique and an approximated representation of the BER of the constituent QAM modes. Chung and Goldsmith <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> also provided a comprehensive set of formulas for determining the optimum switching thresholds for various types of AQAM schemes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a set of suboptimal thresholds were used for the constant-power AQAM scheme under the constraint of requiring a fixed-average BER.</p><p>In this contribution, we derive an exact closed-form expression for the average BER of our constant-power adaptive-modulation schemes employing various phase-shift keying (PSK)-and square-QAM constellations and then apply the Lagrangian optimization technique for deriving the globally optimized modulation-mode switching levels. The relationship between the optimum-mode switching levels is established, which holds regardless of the underlying channel scenario. Then the corresponding optimum-mode switching-assisted constant-power adaptive-modulation schemes are investigated in various operating scenarios, leading to plausible performance results and to our discussions.</p><p>The next section introduces a general model of the constantpower adaptive-modulation schemes considered and defines a set of parameters characterizing their performance, followed by the determination of their closed-form expressions when communicating over a narrow-band Nakagami-fading channel. Section III derives the optimum switching levels with the aid of the Lagrangian-based optimization technique. The performance results of our constant-power AQAM schemes employing various diversity schemes operating in various fading scenarios are presented in Section IV, followed by our conclusions in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</head><p>A stylized model of our adaptive-modulation scheme is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In our adaptive-modulation scheme, the modulation mode used is adapted on a near-instantaneous basis for the sake of counteracting the effects of fading. Let us describe the detailed operation of the adaptive-modem scheme of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. First, the channel quality is estimated by the remote receiver B of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This channel-quality measure can be the instantaneous channel SNR, the radio-signal strength indicator (RSSI) output of the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the decoded BER <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) estimated at the output of the channel equalizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, or the SINR at the output of a CDMA joint detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The estimated channel quality perceived by receiver B is fed back to transmitter A with the aid of a feedback channel, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Then, the transmit mode control block of transmitter A of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> selects the highest throughput modulation mode capable of maintaining the target BER based on the channel-quality measure and the specific set of adaptive mode-switching levels . Once is selected, -ary modulation is performed at transmitter A in order to generate the transmitted signal and the signal is transmitted through the channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Modulation Mode-Switching Model</head><p>A -mode adaptive-modulation scheme adjusts its transmit mode , where , by employing -ary modulation according to the near-instantaneous channel quality perceived by receiver B of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The mode selection rule is given by Choose mode when <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where a switching level belongs to the set . The BPS throughput of a specific modulation mode is given by if , otherwise . It is convenient to define the incremental BPS as when and , which quantifies the achievable BPS increase when switching from the lower throughput mode to mode .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Example: Five-Mode AQAM</head><p>A five-mode AQAM system has been studied extensively by numerous researchers, which was motivated by the high performance of the Gray-mapped constituent modulation modes used. The parameters of this five-mode AQAM system are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. In our investigations, the near-instantaneous channel quality is defined as the instantaneous channel SNR . The boundary-switching levels are given as and .   The channel-quality related SNR regions are divided by the modulation mode switching levels . The peak instantaneous BER (iBER) limiting scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> was used for deriving the switching levels used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(a)</ref>. We assumed the peak iBER of 10 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a). The associated instantaneous BPS throughput is also depicted, using the thick stepped line at the bottom of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a). We can observe that the throughput varied from 0 BPS, when the no-transmission (No-Tx) AQAM mode was chosen, to 4 BPS, when the 16-QAM mode was activated. During the depicted observation window, the 64-QAM mode was not activated. The instantaneous BER, depicted as a thin line using the middle trace of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a), is limited by the peak iBER of 10 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Characteristic Parameters</head><p>In this section, we introduce several parameters in order to characterize our adaptive-modulation scheme. The constituent mode selection probability (MSP) is defined as the probability of selecting the th mode from the set of possible modulation modes, which can be calculated as a function of the channel-quality metric , regardless of the specific metric used, as</p><p>(3) where denotes the mode-switching levels and is the probability density function (pdf) of . Then, the average throughput expressed in terms of BPS can be described as (4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> which in simple verbal terms can be formulated as the weighted sum of the throughput of the individual AQAM constituent modes, where the weighting takes into account the probability of activating the various constituent modes. When , the average throughput can also be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(6) (7) (8)</formula><p>where and is the complementary cumulative distribution function (cdf) defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Let us now assume that we use the instantaneous SNR as the channel quality measure , which implies that no cochannel interference is present. By contrast, when operating in a cochannel interference-limited environment, we can use the instantaneous SINR as the channel quality measure , provided that the cochannel interference has a near-Gaussian distribution. In this scenario, the mode-specific average BER can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where is the BER of the -ary AQAM constituentmodulation mode for transmission over the AWGN channel. We used rather than in order to explicitly indicate the employment of as the channel quality measure. Then, the average BER of our adaptive-modulation scheme can be represented as the sum of the BERs of the specific constituent modes divided by the average adaptive modem throughput , formulated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> (11) where is the BPS throughput of the th modulation mode, is the mode-specific average BER given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and is the average adaptive modem throughput given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> or in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>The aim of our adaptive system is to transmit as high a number of bits per symbol as possible, while providing the required quality of service (QoS). More specifically, we are aiming to maximize the average BPS throughput of (4), while satisfying the average BER requirement of . Hence, we have to satisfy the constraint of meeting while optimizing the design parameter of , which is the set of modulation-mode switching levels. The determination of the optimum switching levels will be investigated in Section III. Since the calculation of the optimum switching levels typically requires the numerical computation of the parameters introduced in this section, it is advantageous to express the parameters in a closed form, which is the objective of the next section.</p><p>1) Closed-Form Expressions for Transmission Over Nakagami-Fading Channels: Fading channels are often modeled as Nakagami-fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The pdf of the instantaneous channel SNR when communicating over a Nakagami-fading channel is given as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> (12)</p><p>where the parameter governs the severity of the fading and is the Gamma function <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. When , the pdf of ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) is reduced to the pdf of over Rayleigh-fading channel. As increases, the fading behaves like Rician fading; it becomes the AWGN channel when tends to . Here, we restrict the value of to be a positive integer. In this case, the Nakagami fading model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, having a mean of , will be used to describe the pdf of the SNR per symbol in an -antenna-based diversity-assisted system employing maximal ratio combining (MRC).</p><p>When the instantaneous channel SNR is used as the channel quality measure in our adaptive-modulation scheme transmitting over a Nakagami channel, the parameters defined in Section II-C can be expressed in a closed form. Specifically, the MPS can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(13) (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where the complementary cdf is given by ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(16)<label>(17)</label></formula><p>In deriving <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, we used the result of the indefinite integral of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> (18)</p><p>In a Rayleigh fading scenario, i.e., when , the MPS of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">14</ref>) can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> The average throughput of our adaptive-modulation scheme transmitting over a Nakagami channel is given by substituting ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">17</ref>) into (8), yielding <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> Let us now derive the closed-form expressions for the modespecific average BER , defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> for the various modulation modes when communicating over a Nakagami channel.

The same expression as ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) can be applied to various coherent star QAM schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. OPTIMUM SWITCHING LEVELS</head><p>In this section, we restrict our interest to adaptive-modulation schemes employing the SNR per symbol as the channel quality measure . Our aim is to optimize the set of switching levels such that the average BPS throughput can be maximized under the constraint of . Let us define for a -mode adaptive-modulation scheme as the sum of the mode-specific average BER weighted by the BPS throughput of the individual constituent mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> where is the average SNR per symbol, is the set of switching levels, is the number of constituent modulation modes, is the BPS throughput of the th constituent mode, and the mode-specific average BER is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Explicitly, (10) implies weighting the BER by its probability of occurrence quantified in terms of its pdf and then averaging, i.e., integrating it over the range spanning from to . Then, with the aid of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, the average BER constraint can also be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> Another logical constraint regarding the switching levels can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> As we discussed before, our optimization goal is to maximize the objective function under the constraint of ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>). The set of switching levels has levels in it. However, considering that often we have and in various adaptive-modulation schemes, we have independent variables in . Hence, the optimization task is a dimensional optimization under a constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. It is a standard practice to introduce a modified objective function using a Lagrangian multiplier and to convert the problem into a set of one-dimensional (1-D) optimization problems. The modified objective function can be formulated employing a Lagrangian multiplier [29] as (31) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> The optimum set of switching levels should satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> By expanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> and eliminating the Lagrangian as shown in Appendix C, we arrive at the following set of relationships between the optimum switching levels:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">for (<label>35</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">) (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">) (23)<label>(24)</label></formula><p>(a) (b) Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The Lagrangian-free functions y (s ) of ( <ref type="formula">37</ref>) to <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> for Gray-mapped square-shaped QAM constellations. As s becomes lower, y (s ) asymptotically approaches 0.5. Observe that while y (s ) and y (s ) are monotonic functions, y (s ) and y (s ) cross the y = 0:5 line.</p><p>where the function is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> which does not contain the Lagrangian multiplier and, hence, will be referred to as the "Lagrangian-free function." This function can be physically interpreted as the normalized BER difference between the adjacent adaptive-modulation modes. For example, quantifies the BER increase when switching from the No-Tx mode to the binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) mode, while indicates the BER difference between the QPSK and BPSK modes. These curve will be more explicitly discussed in the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The significance of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> is that the relationship between the optimum switching levels , where , and the lowest optimum switching level is independent of the underlying propagation scenario. Only the constituent adaptive-modulation mode related parameters, such as , and govern this relationship.</p><p>As an example, let us consider the five-mode AQAM scheme introduced in Section II-B. The parameters of the five-mode AQAM scheme are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. Substituting these parameters into <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula">36</ref>), we have the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(37) (38) (39) (40)</formula><p>The Lagrangian-free functions of ( <ref type="formula">37</ref>) to <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> for Gray-mapped square-shaped QAM.</p><p>As these functions are basically linear combinations of BER curves associated with AWGN channels, they exhibit "waterfall-like" shapes and asymptotically approach 0.5 as the switching levels approach zero (or , expressed in decibels). While and are monotonic functions, and cross the line at dB and dB, respectively, as can be observed in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b</ref>). One should also notice that the trivial solutions of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">35</ref>) are at , , 2, 3, 4, as we have discussed in Appendix C. For a given value of , the other switching levels can be determined as , and . Since deriving the analytical inverse function of is an arduous task, we can rely on a graphical or a numerical method. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(b) illustrates an example of the graphical method. Specifically, when , we first find the point on the curve directly above the abscissa value of , and then draw a horizontal line across the corresponding point. From the crossover points found on the curves of , , and , with the aid of the horizontal line, we can find the corresponding values of the other switching levels, namely those of , , and . In a numerical sense, this solution corresponds to a 1-D root-finding problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 9]</ref>. Since the first Lagrangian-free equation is given as according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, is monotonic and is restricted to the range of . In general, however, for may not be monotonic, potentially resulting in multiple roots that satisfy . Nevertheless, as we argued in Appendix C, we can establish a unique relationship between and without jeopardizing the optimality in our average SNR range of interest. The numerical results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> represent the direct relationship between the optimum switching level and the other optimum switching levels, namely , and . While the optimum value of shows a near-linear relationship with respect to , those of and asymptotically approach two different constants, as becomes smaller. This corroborates the trends observed in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b)</ref>, where and cross the line at dB and dB, respectively. Since the low-order modulation modes are abandoned at high average channel SNRs in order to increase the average throughput, the high values of on the horizontal axis of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> indicate the encountering of a low-channel SNR, while low values of suggest that high-channel SNRs are experienced, as it transpires for example from Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p><p>Since we can relate the other switching levels to , we have to determine the optimum value of for the given target BER,</p><p>, and the pdf of the instantaneous channel SNR by solving the constraint equation given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. This problem also constitutes a 1-D root-finding problem, rather than a multidimensional optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Let us define the constraint function using <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> as <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> where we represented the set of switching levels as a vector, which is the function of , in order to emphasize that satisfies the relationships given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">35</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. More explicitly, of ( <ref type="formula">41</ref>) can be physically interpreted as the difference between , namely the sum of the mode-specific average BERs weighted by the BPS throughput of the individual AQAM modes, as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, and the average BPS throughput weighted by the target BER . Considering the equivalence relationship given in ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>), (41) reflects just another way of expressing the difference between the average BER of the adaptive scheme and the target BER</p><p>. Even though the relationships implied in are independent of the propagation conditions and the signaling power, the constraint function of (41) and, hence, the actual values of the optimum switching levels are dependent on the propagation conditions through the pdf of the SNR per symbol and on-the-average SNR per symbol .</p><p>Let us find the initial value of defined in (41), when . An obvious solution for when is for . In this case, becomes</p><p>where is the BPS throughput of the highest order constituent AQAM modulation mode, is the average BER of the highest order constituent modulation mode for transmission over the underlying channel scenario and is the target average BER. The value of could be positive or negative, depending on the average SNR and on the target average BER . Let us denote the avalanche SNR by as such that we have</p><p>, where the highest order modulation mode satisfies the target average BER requirement. We observe that the modulation mode adaptation is abandoned when the average SNR becomes higher than the avalanche SNR, . Another nonzero solution for may exist when , if crosses the horizontal line of . This situation can be observed in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b)</ref> for and . The corresponding value of 0 using this alternative solution turns out to be close to . However, in the actual numerical evaluation of the initial value of , we should use 0 for ensuring the continuity of the function at . Investigating the minima and the maxima of as detailed in Appendix D, it was found that has a global minimum of at such that and a maximum of at , as well as another maximum value 0 at . This implies that there exists a unique set of optimum switching levels, when we have at , i.e., when the average SNR satisfies . As an example, let us evaluate the constraint function for our five-mode AQAM scheme operating over a flat Rayleigh-fading channel. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> depicts the values of for several values of the target average BER , when the average channel SNR is 30 dB. We can observe that may have a root, depending on the target BER . When for , according to ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, is reduced to <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref> where is the average BER of 64-QAM over a flat Rayleigh channel.

Narrow-Band Nakagami--Fading Channel</head><p>In this section, we study the various aspects of the adaptive square QAM scheme, employing the optimum switching levels of Section III communicating over a narrow-band Nakagami--fading channel.

The optimum switching levels of adaptive square QAM were studied in Section III as an example.</p><p>The average BER of our six-mode adaptive square QAM scheme operating over a flat Rayleigh-fading channel is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(a)</ref>, which shows that the modem maintains the required constant target BER until it reaches the BER curve of the specific fixed-mode modulation scheme employing the highest order modulation mode, namely 256 QAM. It then follows the BER curve of the 256-QAM mode. The various gray lines in the figure represent the BER of the fixed constituent modulation modes for transmission over a flat Rayleigh-fading channel. An arbitrarily low-target BER could be maintained at the expense of a reduced throughput.</p><p>The average throughput is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>(b), together with the estimated channel capacity of the narrow-band Rayleigh channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, along with the throughput of several variable-power, variable-rate modems reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Specifically, Goldsmith and Chua <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> studied the performance of their variable-power, variable-rate adaptive modems based on a BER bound of -ary square QAM, rather than using an exact BER expression. Since our adaptive square QAM schemes do not vary the transmission power, our scheme can be regarded as a suboptimal policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, the throughput performance of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>(b) shows that the SNR degradation is within 2 dB in the low SNR region and within half a decibel in the high-SNR region, in comparison to the ideal continuously variable-power adaptive QAM scheme employing a range of hypothetical continuously variable BPS throughput-based, rather than discrete-throughput-based QAM modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, represented as the "Goldsmith 1" scheme in the figure. Goldsmith and Chua <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> also characterized the performance of a variable-power, discrete-rate as well as that of a discrete-power, discrete-rate scheme, which we represented as the "Goldsmith 2" and "Goldsmith 3" schemes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>(b), respectively. It can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>(b) that the optimum AQAM scheme outperforms the "Goldsmith 2" and "Goldsmith 3" schemes in the high-SNR region, even though we kept the power constant.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>(a) depicts the average BPS throughput of our various adaptive square QAM schemes operating over a Rayleigh channel associated with at the target BER of 10 . Fig. <ref type="figure">8(a)</ref> shows that even though the constituent modulation modes of our adaptive schemes do not include 3-, 5-, and 7-BPS constellations, the average BPS throughput steadily increases without undulations. Compared to the fixed-mode square QAM schemes operating over an AWGN channel, our adaptive schemes require additional SNRs of less than 3.5 dB when the throughput is below 6.5 BPS. Let us now investigate the effects of the Nakagami fading parameter on the average BPS throughput performance of the adaptive square QAM schemes, observing Fig. <ref type="figure">8(b)</ref>.The BPS throughput of the fixed-mode square QAM schemes for transmission over an AWGN channel is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>(b) as the ultimate performance limit achievable by the adaptive schemes operating over Nakagami-fading channels. As the Nakagami fading parameter increases from 1 to 2 and to 6, the SNR gap between the adaptive schemes operating over a Nakagami-fading channel and the fixed-mode schemes operating over an AWGN channel decreases. When the average SNR is less than dB, the average BPS throughput of our adaptive schemes decreases when the fading parameter increases. The rationale of this phenomenon is that as the channel becomes more and more like an AWGN channel due to increasing parameter, the probability of activating the BPSK mode is reduced, resulting in more frequent activation of the No-Tx mode and, hence, the corresponding average BPS throughput inevitably decreases. We can also observe that the average BPS throughput recorded for the fading parameter of exhibits an undulating curve. For example, an increased value results in a limited improvement of the corresponding average BPS throughput near the throughput values of 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 BPS. This is because our adaptive square QAM schemes do not use 3-, 5-, and 7-BPS constituent modes. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>(a) depicts the corresponding optimum mode-switching levels for the six-mode adaptive square QAM scheme. The black lines represent the switching levels when the Nakagami fading parameter is and the gray lines when . In general, the lower the switching levels, the higher the average BPS throughput of the adaptive modems. When the Nakagami fading parameter is , the switching levels decrease monotonically, as the average SNR increases. However, when the fading severity parameter is , the switching levels fluctuate, exhibiting several local minima around 12, 18, and 24 dB. In general, the optimum switching levels become higher as the average SNR becomes higher. However, the switching level curves undulate because, as the average SNR becomes higher, the next higher throughput modulation mode becomes predominantly selected and the average target BER cannot be maintained unless the switching levels are increased. In the extreme case of , i.e., when operating over an AWGN-like channel, the switching levels would be and for other values in the SNR range of dB dB, and when we have dB dB, except for when the SNR is in the range of dB dB. Finally, we have for , if dB, when considering the fixed-mode square QAM performance achieved for transmission over an AWGN channel represented by the makers " " in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(b)</ref>. Observing Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>(b), we find that our adaptive schemes become highly "selective" when the Nakagami-fading parameter becomes , exhibiting narrow triangular mode-selection pdf shapes. As increases, the shapes will eventually converge to Kronecker delta functions.</p><p>A possible approach to reducing the undulating behavior of the average BPS throughput curve is the introduction of a 3-and 5-BPS mode as additional constituent modem modes. The power-efficiency of 8-Star QAM and 32-Star QAM is insufficient for maintaining a linear growth of the average BPS throughput, as we can observe in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(b)</ref>. Instead, the most power-efficient twin-ring phasor-constellation based 8-ary QAM scheme <ref type="bibr">[30, pp. 279</ref>] and 32-ary cross-shaped constellation based QAM scheme <ref type="bibr">[2, p. 236</ref>] have the potential for reducing these undulation effects.</p><p>The effects of the Nakagami-fading factor on the relative SNR gain of our adaptive Square QAM scheme can be observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">10</ref>. The less severe the fading, the smaller the relative SNR advantage of employing adaptive Square QAM in comparison to its fixed-mode counterparts. Except for the 1-BPS mode, the SNR gains become less than 0.5 dB when is increased to 6 at the target BER of 10 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Performance Over Narrow-Band Rayleigh Channels Using Antenna Diversity</head><p>As we discussed in Section II-C1, the performance of the system when communicating over a flat Nakagami-fading channel having a fading parameter of is equivalent to that of the scheme transmitting over number of independent flat Rayleigh channels when maximum ratio combining (MRC)-assisted diversity is employed. Therefore, the results of Section IV-A can be invoked for characterizing an MRC antenna diversity-assisted adaptive-square QAM scheme operating over independent Rayleigh channels. However, the combined average SNR of the MRC assisted adaptive square QAM scheme is times higher than that of the adaptive square QAM scheme communicating over a flat Nakagami-fading channel. Hence, in order to gain an insight into the performance of the MRC antenna-diversity assisted adaptive square QAM scheme communicating over number of independent Rayleigh-fading channels, the related performance is presented in this section without repeating the results similar to those presented in Section IV-A.</p><p>The BER expression of the fixed-mode coherent BPSK scheme can be found in <ref type="bibr">[30, p. 781</ref>] and those of coherent square QAM can be readily expressed using <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref> with the substitution of and . The performance of antenna-diversity assisted adaptive square QAM schemes can be readily analyzed using the technique developed in Section III.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>(a) depicts the average BPS throughput performance of our adaptive schemes employing MRC-aided antenna diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> operating over independent Rayleigh-fading channels at the target average BER of 10 . The markers represent the performance of the corresponding fixed-mode square QAM modems in the same propagation scenario. The average SNRs that are required for achieving the target BER of the fixed-mode schemes and that of the adaptive schemes decrease as the antenna diversity order increases. However, the differences between the required SNRs of the adaptive schemes and their fixed-mode counterparts also decrease as the antenna diversity order increases. The SNRs of both schemes that are required for achieving the target BERs of 10 are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11(b)</ref>, where we can observe that employing dual antenna based diversity is sufficient for the fixed-mode schemes in order to obtain half of the achievable SNR gain of the six antenna-aided diversity scheme, whereas triple-antenna assisted diversity is required for the adaptive schemes operating in the same scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performance Over Wide-Band Rayleigh Channels Using Antenna Diversity</head><p>Wide-band fading channels are characterized by their multipath intensity profiles (MIPs). In order to study the performance of the various adaptive-modulation schemes, we employ two different MIP models in this section, namely a shortened wireless asynchronous transfer mode (W-ATM) channel [2, Ch. 20] characteristic of an indoor scenario and a bad-urban reduced-model A (BU-RA) channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, which is typical for a hilly urban outdoor scenario. Their MIPs are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>. The W-ATM channel exhibits short-range low-delay multipath components, while the BU-RA channel exhibits six higher delay multipath components. Again, let us assume that our receivers are equipped with MRC RAKE receivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, employing a sufficiently higher number of RAKE fingers in order to capture all the multipath components generated by our channel models. Furthermore, we employ antenna diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 5</ref>] at the receivers. This combined diversity scheme is often referred to as a two-dimensional (2-D) RAKE receiver <ref type="bibr">[34, pp. 263</ref>]. The schematic of our RAKE receiver and antenna diversity assisted adaptive quadrature amplitude modulation (AQAM) system is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13</ref>. For the sake of analytical tractability we assume that each antenna experiences an identical MIP, while each diversity branch experiences independent Rayleigh fading. Our 2-D RAKE assisted fixed-mode QAM schemes are analyzed in Appendix E and the characteristic parameters of the 2-D RAKE assisted AQAM scheme are also given in Appendix F. Hence, the performance of our 2-D-RAKE assisted AQAM scheme employing the optimum switching levels can be readily characterized.</p><p>The average BPS throughputs of our 2-D-RAKE assisted adaptive schemes operating over the two different types of wide-band channel scenarios is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">14</ref> for the target BER of 10 . The throughput performance depicted corresponds to the upper-bound performance of direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) or multicarrier CDMA employing RAKE receivers and that of the MRC-aided diversity-assisted scheme in the absence of multiple access interference (MAI). We can observe that the BPS throughput curves undulate when the number of antennas increases. This effect is more pronounced for transmission over the BU-RA channel, since this channel exhibits six multipath components, increasing the available diversity potential of the system approximately by a factor of two in comparison to that of the W-ATM channel. The performance of our adaptive scheme employing more than three antennas for transmission over the BU-RA channel could not be obtained owing to numerical instability, since the associated curves become similar to a series of step-functions, which is not analytic in mathematical terms.</p><p>The corresponding mode-switching levels and mode-selection probabilities are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">15</ref>. Again, the switching levels heavily undulate. The mode-selection probability curve of BPSK has a triangular shape, increasing linearly, as the average SNR increases to 2.5 dB and decreasing linearly again, as increases beyond 2.5 dB. On the other hand, the mode-selection probability curve of QPSK increases linearly and decreases exponentially, since no 3-BPS mode is used. This explains why the BPS throughput curves increase in a near-linear fashion in the SNR range of 0-5 dB and in a staircase fashion beyond that point. We may conclude that the staircase-like shape in the upper SNR range is a consequence of the absence of the 3-, 5-, and 7-BPS modulation modes in the set of constituent modulation modes employed. As we discussed in Section IV-A, this problem may be mitigated by introducing power-efficient twin-ring 8-QAM cross-constellation-based 32-QAM and 128-QAM modes.</p><p>The average SNRs required for achieving the target BER of 10 by the 2-D-RAKE assisted adaptive scheme and the fixed-mode schemes operating over wide-band fading channels are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">16</ref>. Since the fixed-mode schemes employing RAKE receivers are already enjoying the diversity benefit of multipath-fading channels, the SNR advantages of our adaptive schemes are less than 8 and 2.6 dB over the W-ATM and BU-RA channels, respectively, even when a single antenna is employed. This relatively small SNR gain, in comparison to those observed over narrow-band fading channels in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11(b)</ref>, erode as the number of antennas increases. For example, when the number of antennas is , the SNR gains of the adaptive schemes operating over the W-ATM channel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>(a) become virtually zero, where the combined channel becomes an AWGN-like channel. On the other hand, number of antennas is sufficient for the BU-RA channel for exhibiting such a behavior since the underlying multipath diversity provided by the six-path BU-RA channel is higher than that of the tree-path W-ATM channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Uncoded Adaptive Multicarrier Schemes</head><p>The performance of the various adaptive square QAM schemes has also been studied in the context of multicarrier systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The family of orthogonal frequency-division multiplex (OFDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> systems convert frequency-elective Rayleigh channels into frequency-nonselective or flat Rayleigh channels for each subcarrier, provided that the number of subcarriers is sufficiently high. The power and bit-allocation strategy of adaptive OFDM has attracted substantial research interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and it was argued that OFDM is particularly suitable for combined time-frequency domain processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Since each subcarrier of an OFDM system experiences a flat Rayleigh channel, we can apply adaptive modulation for each subcarrier independently from other subcarriers. Moreover, a practical scheme would group the subcarriers into similar-quality subbands for the sake of reducing the associated modem mode-signaling requirements. The performance of this AQAM-assisted OFDM (A-OFDM) scheme is identical to that of the adaptive scheme operating over flat Rayleigh-fading channels, characterized in Section IV-B.</p><p>The MC-CDMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> receiver can be regarded as a frequency domain RAKE-receiver, where the multiple carriers play a role similar to that of the time-domain RAKE fingers. Our simulation results showed that the single-user BER performance of MC-CDMA employing multiple antennae is essentially identical to that of the time-domain RAKE receiver using antenna diversity, provided that the spreading factor is higher than the number of resolvable multipath components in the channel. Hence, the throughput of the RAKE-receiver over the three-path W-ATM channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the six-path BU-RA channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> studied in Section IV-C can be used for investigating the upper-bound performance of adaptive MC-CDMA schemes when communicating over these channels. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">17</ref> compares the average BPS throughput performances of these schemes, where the throughput curves of the various adaptive schemes are represented as three different types of lines, depending on the underlying channel scenarios, while the fixed-mode schemes are represented as three different types of markers. The solid line corresponds to the performance of A-OFDM and the marker " " corresponds to that of the fixed-mode OFDM. On the other hand, the dotted lines correspond to the BPS throughput performance of adaptive MC-CDMA operating over wide-band channels and the  markers " " and " " to those of the fixed-mode MC-CDMA schemes.</p><p>It can be observed that fixed-mode MC-CDMA has the potential to outperform A-OFDM, when the underlying channel provides sufficient diversity due to the high number of resolvable multipath components. For example, the performance of fixed-mode MC-CDMA operating over the W-ATM channel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12(a</ref>) is slightly lower than that of A-OFDM for the BPS range of less than or equal to 6 BPS, owing to the insufficient diversity potential of the wide-band channel. On the other hand, fixed-mode MC-CDMA outperforms A-OFDM when the channel is characterized by the BU-RA model of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12(b)</ref>. We have to consider several factors in order to resolve whether fixed-mode MC-CDMA is capable of outperforming A-OFDM. Firstly, fully loaded MC-CDMA, which can transmit the same number of symbols as OFDM, suffers from multicode interference and our simulation results showed that the SNR degrada-tion is about 2-4 dB at the BER of 10 , when the minimum mean square error block decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-BDFE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> based joint detector is used at the receiver. Considering these SNR degradations, the throughput of fixed-mode MC-CDMA using the MMSE-BDFE joint detection receiver falls just below that of the A-OFDM scheme when the channel is characterized by the BU-RA model. On the other hand, the adaptive schemes may suffer from inaccurate channel estimation/prediction and modem mode signaling feedback delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Hence, the preferred order of the various schemes may depend on the channel scenario encountered, on the interference effects, and on other practical issues, such as the aforementioned channel estimation accuracy, feedback delays, etc. In the previous sections, we have studied various receiver diversity-assisted adaptive single-and multicarrier modems. In the next section, we focus our attention on employing transmit-diversity assisted adaptive transceivers and channel coding. </p></div>

Concatenated Space-Time Block-Coded and Turbo-Coded Symbol-by-Symbol Adaptive OFDM and Multicarrier CDMA</head><p>In the previous sections, we studied the performance of uncoded adaptive schemes. Since a forward error correction (FEC) code reduces the SNR required for achieving a given target BER at the expense of a reduced BPS throughput, it is interesting to investigate the performance of adaptive schemes employing FEC techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. A variety of FEC techniques have been used in the context of adaptive-modulation schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In their pioneering work on adaptive modulation, Webb and Steele <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> used a set of binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghen (BCH) codes. Vucetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> employed various punctured convolutional codes in response to the time-variant channel's status.

In this section, we investigate the performance of various concatenated ST, block-coded, and turbo-coded adaptive OFDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and MC-CDMA schemes.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">18</ref> portrays the stylized transmitter structure of our system.

Then, the AQAM block selects a modulation mode from the set of no transmission, BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM, depending on the instantaneous channel quality perceived by the receiver, according to the SNR-dependent  optimum switching levels derived in Section III. It is assumed that the perfectly estimated channel quality experienced by receiver A is fed back to transmitter B superimposed on the next burst transmitted to receiver B of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The modulation mode-switching levels of our AQAM scheme determine the average BER as well as the average throughput.</p><p>The modulated symbol is now ST encoded.

A pair of the adjacent subcarriers belonging to the same ST encoding block is assumed to have the same channel quality. We employed a wireless asynchronous transfer mode (W-ATM) channel model <ref type="bibr">[2, p. 474]</ref> transmitting at a carrier frequency of 60 GHz, at a sampling rate of 225 MHz, and employing 512 subcarriers.

The MIP of the W-ATM channel is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>(a) in Section IV-C. Each of the transmit-diversity channels associated with a different antenna is assumed to exhibit independent Rayleigh fading.</p><p>The simulation results related to our uncoded adaptive modems are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">19</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">19</ref>(a), both the continuous black lines and the related markers drawn in continuous lines represent the BERs, while their gray or "halftone" counterparts the BPS throughputs. Viewing Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">19</ref>(a) from a different perspective, all the lines indicate analytical results, while all the markers correspond to simulation results. The set of three BER curves represented by the black lines that are decreasing as the average SNR increases corresponds to those of fixed-mode OFDM and the MC-CDMA schemes supporting and 16 users. Since we employed the optimum-switching levels derived in Section III, both our adaptive OFDM (AOFDM) and adaptive single-user MC-CDMA (AMC-CDMA) modems maintain the constant target BER of 10 up to the "avalanche" SNR value and then follow one of the three BER curves corresponding to the fixed 64-QAM mode. However, "full-user" AMC-CDMA, which is defined as an AMC-CDMA system supporting users with the aid of a spreading factor of and employing the MMSE-BDFE joint detection (JD) receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, exhibits a slightly higher average BER than the BER target of 10 due to the fact that the residual multiuser interference (MUI) of the imperfect joint detector does not strictly follow a Gaussian distribution. Since in Section III we derived the optimum-switching levels based on a single-user system free from MUI, the levels are no longer optimum when the residual MUI does not follow the Gaussian distribution. The average throughputs of the various schemes expressed in terms of BPS steadily increase and at high SNRs reach the throughput of 64 QAM, namely 6BPS. The throughput degradation of "full-user" MC-CDMA, imposed by the imperfect JD, was within a fraction of a decibel. Observe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">19</ref>(a) that the analytical and simulation results are in good agreement, which we denoted by the lines and distinct symbols, respectively.</p><p>The effects of ST coding on the average BPS throughput are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">19(b)</ref>. Specifically, the four different styles of thick lines represent the average BPS throughput of our AMC-CDMA scheme, while the four thin lines represent those of our AOFDM modem. The four pairs of hollow and filled markers associated with the four different ST-coded AOFDM and AMC-CDMA scenarios considered represent the BPS throughput versus SNR values associated with the fixed-mode OFDM and fixed-mode MMSE-BDFE JD-assisted MC-CDMA schemes. Specifically, observe for each of the 1, 2, and 4 BPS fixed-mode schemes that the right-most markers, namely the circles, correspond to the 1-Tx/1-Rx scenario, the squares to the 2-Tx/1-Rx scheme, the triangles to the 1-Tx/2-Rx arrangement, and the diamonds to the 2-Tx/2-Rx scenarios. First of all, we can observe that the BPS throughput curves of OFDM and single-user MC-CDMA are close to each other, namely within 1 dB for most of the SNR range. This is surprising, considering that the fixed-mode MMSE-BDFE JD-assisted MC-CDMA scheme was reported to exhibit around 10 dB SNR gain at a BER of 10 and 30 dB gain at a BER of 10 over OFDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. This is confirmed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">19(b</ref>) by observing that the SNR difference between the and markers is approximately 10 dB, regardless whether the 4, 2, or 1 BPS scenario is concerned.</p><p>Let us now compare the achievable SNR gains of the adaptive modems over the fixed modems. The SNR difference between the BPS curve of AOFDM and the fixed-mode OFDM represented by the symbol at the same throughput is approximately 15 dB. The corresponding SNR difference between the adaptive and fixed-mode 4, 2, or 1 BPS MC-CDMA modem is approximately 5 dB. More explicitly, since in the context of the W-ATM channel model [2, p. 474] fixed-mode MC-CDMA appears to exhibit a 10-dB SNR gain over fixed-mode OFDM, the additional 5-dB SNR gain of AMC-CDMA over its fixed-mode counterpart results in a total SNR gain of 15 dB over fixed-mode OFDM. Hence, ultimately, the performance of AOFDM and AMC-CDMA becomes similar.</p><p>Let us now examine the effect of ST block coding. The SNR gain of the fixed-mode schemes, due to the introduction of a 2-Tx/1-Rx ST block code, is represented as the SNR difference between the two right-most markers, namely circles and squares. These gains are nearly 10 dB for fixed-mode OFDM, while they are only 3 dB for the fixed-mode MC-CDMA modems. However, the corresponding gains are less than </p></div>

(b) The SNR gain of the adaptive modems decreases as ST coding increases the diversity order. The BPS curves appear in pairs, corresponding to AOFDM and AMC-CDMA-indicated by the thin and thick lines, respectively-for each of the four different ST code configurations. The markers represent the SNRs required by the fixed-mode OFDM and MC-CDMA schemes for maintaining the target BER of 10 in conjunction with the four ST-coded schemes considered.</p><p>1 dB for both adaptive modems, namely for AOFDM and AMC-CDMA. Since the transmitter power is halved due to using two Tx antennas in the ST code, a 3-dB channel SNR penalty was already applied to the curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">19(b</ref>). The introduction of a second receive antenna instead of a second transmit antenna eliminates this 3-dB penalty, which results in a better performance for the 1-Tx/2-Rx scheme than for the 2-Tx/1-Rx arrangement. Finally, the 2-Tx/2-Rx system gives approximately 3-4 dB SNR gain in the context of fixed-mode OFDM and a 2-3 dB SNR gain for fixed-mode MC-CDMA, in both cases over the 1-Tx/2-Rx system. By contrast, the SNR gain of the 2-Tx/2-Rx scheme over the 1-Tx/2-Rx based adaptive modems was, again, less than 1 dB in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">19(b</ref>). More importantly is, for the 2-Tx/2-Rx scenario, the advantage of employing adaptive-modulation erodes, since the fixed-mode MC-CDMA modem performs as well as the AMC-CDMA modem in this scenario. Moreover, the fixed-mode MC-CDMA modem still outperforms the fixed-mode OFDM modem by about 2 dB. We conclude that since the diversity-order increases with the introduction of ST block codes, the channel quality variation becomes sufficiently small for the performance advantage of adaptive modems to erode. This is achieved at the expense of a higher complexity, due to employing two transmitters and two receivers in the ST-coded system. The performance of the concatenated ST block coded and turbo convolutional coded adaptive modems is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">20</ref>. We applied the optimum set of switching levels designed in Section III for achieving an uncoded BER of 3 10 . This uncoded target BER was stipulated after observing that it is reduced by the half-rate, turbo convolutional coding to a BER below 10 , when transmitting over AWGN channels. However, our simulation results yielded zero bit errors when transmitting 10 bits, except for some SNRs when employing only a single antenna.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">20</ref>(a) shows the BER of our turbo-coded adaptive modems, when a single transmit and receive antenna is used.</p><p>We observe in the figure that the BER reaches its highest value around the "avalanche" SNR point, where the adaptive-modulation scheme consistently activates 64 QAM. The system is most vulnerable around this point. In order to interpret this phenomenon, let us briefly consider the associated channel interleaving aspects. For practical reasons, we have used a fixed turbo interleaver length of bits. When the instantaneous channel quality was high, the bits were spanning a shorter time-duration during their passage over the fading channel, corresponding to a reduced number of modulated symbols since the effective BPS throughput was high. Hence, the channel errors appeared more bursty than in the lower-throughput AQAM modes, which conveyed the bits over a longer time duration, corresponding to a higher number of modulated symbols and, hence, dispersing the error bursts over a longer duration of time. The uniform dispersion of erroneous bits versus time enhances the error-correction power of the turbo code. On the other hand, in the SNR region beyond the "avalanche" SNR point seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">20(a)</ref>, the system exhibited a lower uncoded BER, reducing the coded BER even further. This observation suggests that further research ought to determine the set of switching thresholds directly for a coded adaptive system, rather than by simply estimating the uncoded BER, which is expected to result in nearly error-free transmission.</p><p>We can also observe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">20</ref>(a) that the turbo-coded BER of AOFDM is higher than that of AMC-CDMA in the SNR rage of 10-20 dB, even though the uncoded BER is the same. This appears to be the effect of the limited exploitation of frequency domain diversity of coded OFDM, compared to MC-CDMA, which leads to a more bursty uncoded error distribution, hence degrading the turbo-coded performance. The fact that ST block coding aided multiple antenna systems shows virtually error-free performance corroborates our argument. The SNR difference between the throughput curves of the ST and turbo coded AOFDM and those of the corresponding AMC-CDMA schemes was reduced compared to the uncoded performance curves of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">19(b</ref>). The SNR gain owing to ST block coding assisted transmit diversity in the context of AOFDM and AMC-CDMA was within 1 dB due to the halved transmitter power. Therefore, again, ST block coding appears to be less effective in conjunction with adaptive modems. Phrased from a different perspective, the advantages of adaptive-modulation erode in conjunction with multiple transmitters and receivers since both techniques attempt to mitigate the effects of channel quality fluctuations.</p><p>In conclusion, the performance of ST block coded constant-power adaptive multicarrier modems employing optimum SNR-dependent modem mode-switching levels were investigated in this section. The adaptive modems maintained the constant target BER stipulated, while maximizing the average throughput. As expected, it was found that ST block coding reduces the relative performance advantage of adaptive modulation, since it increases the diversity order and eventually reduces the channel quality variations. When turbo convolutional coding was concatenated to the ST block codes, nearly error-free transmission was achieved at the expense of halving the average throughput. Compared to the uncoded system, the turbo-coded system was capable of achieving a higher throughput in the low SNR region at the expense of a higher complexity. The study of the relationship between the uncoded BER and the corresponding coded BER showed that adaptive modems obtain higher coding gains than that of fixed modems. This was due to the fact that the adaptive modem avoids burst errors even in deep channel fades by reducing the number of bits per modulated symbol, eventually to zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION</head><p>We characterized the performance of various constant-power, adaptive-modulation schemes using the globally optimum switching levels based on the Lagrangian technique. In Section II-C1, the closed-form expressions were derived for the average BER, the average BPS throughput, and the MPS of the adaptive-modulation schemes, which were shown to be dependent on the mode-switching levels as well as on the average SNR. A set of relationships between the optimum mode-switching levels of a generic constant-power adaptive-modulation scheme was provided, where the relationships hold regardless of the operating channel scenario. The globally optimum switching levels were derived such that the average BER remains at the constant target average BER, while achieving the maximum possible BPS throughput for the given average SNR.</p><p>Then, in Section IV-A the performance of uncoded AQAM was characterized, when the underlying channel was a Nakagamifading channel. It was found that an adaptive scheme employing a -BPS fixed-mode as the highest throughput constituent modulation mode achieved the highest possible BPS throughputs achievable by any link adaptation for the given SNR up to BPS. For example, a three-mode AQAM scheme employing No-Tx, 1-BPS BPSK, and 2-BPS QPSK modes attained the maximum possible average throughput up to 1 BPS. Hence, adding higher-throughput modes, such as 4-BPS 16-QAM to the three-mode AQAM scheme, which resulted in a four-mode AQAM scheme did not achieve a better BPS performance across the throughput range below 1 BPS. Instead, this four-mode AQAM scheme extended the maximal achievable average BPS throughput of the AQAM scheme to 2 BPS, while asymptotically achieving a throughput of 3 BPS as the average SNR increases.</p><p>On the other hand, the relative SNR advantage of adaptive schemes increased in comparison to fixed-mode schemes as the target average BER became lower and decreased as the fading became less severe. More explicitly, less-severe fading corresponds to an increased Nakagami fading parameter , to an increased number of diversity antennas, or to an increased number of multipath components encountered in wide-band fading channels. As the fading becomes less severe, the average BPS throughput curves of our adaptive square QAM schemes exhibit undulations owing to the absence of 3-, 5-, and 7-BPS square QAM modes.</p><p>The comparisons between fixed-mode MC-CDMA and adaptive OFDM (AOFDM) were made based on a number of different channel models in an effort to verify the applicability of our conclusions for different propagation scenarios. In Section IV-D, it was found that fixed-mode MC-CDMA might outperform adaptive OFDM, when the underlying channel provides sufficient diversity. However, this conclusion has to be verified by further research under more practicable conditions, since in practice MC-CDMA might suffer from MUI and AOFDM might suffer from imperfect channel-quality estimation and feedback delays.</p><p>Concatenated ST block-coded and turbo-convolutional-coded adaptive multicarrier systems were investigated in Section IV-E. The coded schemes reduced the required average SNR by about 6-7 dB at a throughput of 1 BPS, achieving near error-free transmission. It was also observed in Section IV-E that increasing the number of transmit antennas in adaptive schemes was not very effective, achieving less than 1-dB SNR gain, due to the fact that the transmit power per antenna had to be reduced in order to limit the total transmit power for the sake of fair comparison. In conclusion, adaptive modulation can be viewed as the lower complexity solution mitigating the wireless channel's quality fluctuations in comparison to multiple transmit-and receive-antenna-assisted ST-coded systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Additionally, it is important to note that while a conventional fixed-mode transceiver simply drops a call when the instantaneous channel quality is below a certain level, the adaptive transceivers drop their throughput, which is increased again during instances of high channel quality. This powerful technique has the potential for doubling the teletraffic capacity of the network when supported by intelligent networking procedures, as demonstrated by the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p></div>
