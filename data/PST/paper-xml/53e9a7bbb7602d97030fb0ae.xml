Decentralized observer independent of the time delays is first designed. Then, we employ the bounds information of uncertain interconnections to construct the decentralized output feedback controller via backstepping design method. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, we show that the designed controller can render the closed-loop system asymptotically stable with the help of the changing supplying function idea. Furthermore, the corresponding decentralized control problem is considered under the case that the bounds of uncertain interconnections are not precisely known. By employing the neural network approximation theory, we construct the neural network output feedback controller with corresponding adaptive law. The resulting closed-loop system is stable in the sense of semiglobal boundedness. The observers and controllers constructed in this paper are independent of the time delays. Finally, simulations are done to verify the effectiveness of the theoretic results obtained.</p><p>Index Terms-Interconnected systems, neural network control, observer design, output feedback, time-delay systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE study of interconnected systems is motivated by quite a number of practical applications such as power networks, transportation, aerospace, economics, and management. The decentralized control problem for interconnected systems has received considerable attentions; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the references therein. The main objectives of decentralized control are to find some feedback laws for adapting the interconnections from the other subsystems where no state information is transferred. The advantage of decentralized control design is to reduce the complexity and therefore to allow the control implementation to be more feasible.</p><p>State feedback controllers have been designed to solve the decentralized control problem of nonlinear systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The adaptive state feedback controllers were constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Based on backstepping method, the state feedback controller was designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. With the interconnections unknown, the decentralized neural network controller was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Hierarchical control problem was investigated for interconnected systems via recurrent neural network in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Under the case that the state cannot be totally obtained, the output feedback controllers were used to solve the stabilization problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The case of static output feedback control has been tackled in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> where certain conditions were imposed on the class of systems under investigation. Dynamic output feedback control problem was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Based on adaptive control technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the decentralized output feedback controllers were designed for the case when the nominal system is assumed to be of certain structure and the uncertain nonlinear interconnections are bounded by functions of output. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, dynamic output feedback controller was constructed based on the reduced-order observer. However, the systems investigated in the aforementioned literature are free of the time delays.</p><p>It is well known that time delays are frequently encountered in various engineering fields and can cause the instability. There are instances where delays in the interconnections for many physical systems must be included in the model to account for transmission or information delays. Some results on the decentralized stabilization of large-scale systems with delays in the interconnection patterns have been reported in the literature. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the authors considered the control problem of the class of time-invariant large-scale interconnected systems free of uncertainties subject to multiple constant delays. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the author considered a class of large-scale interconnected systems with delays, and assumed that all delays were equal and constant, while the result only applied to the system for which the number of inputs and outputs was equal to the number of states <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Mahmoud and Bingulac <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> considered the control problem of interconnected time-delay systems and designed the controller based on the knowledge of the uncertainties bounds. The decentralized sliding mode control problem was investigated for the large-scale time-delay systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the authors investigated the stabilization problem of large-scale stochastic systems with time delay and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the authors considered the problem of robust stabilization for a class of time-varying large-scale systems subject to multiple timevarying delays in the interconnections. However, in the aforementioned literature, the investigated interconnected time-delay systems are linear or in part linear. The results obtained are often in the form of Riccati equation and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Little attention has been paid to the nonlinear interconnected time-delay systems. How to apply the nonlinear control method such as backstepping method to the control of the time-delay nonlinear systems, especially the interconnected time-delay systems, is a challenging subject. The existence of time delays will render the control problem more complicated and difficult. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the authors considered the robust control problem for time-delay nonlinear systems via backstepping method. However, the results are not desirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, we have investigated the control problem for a class of time-delay nonlinear systems via backstepping method and constructed the corresponding output feedback controller. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, state feedback controller was successfully constructed to control a class of time-delay nonlinear systems via neural network method.</p><p>In this paper, we will investigate the dynamic output feedback control problem for a class of large-scale interconnected systems with time delays. Each subsystem is in the form of the triangular form and includes the internal dynamics. The observer is designed at first. With the bounds information of uncertain interconnections known, we construct the observer-based output feedback controller via backstepping method. By employing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method and changing supplying function idea, we prove that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. Furthermore, the output feedback control problem is investigated under the case that the bounds of uncertain interconnections are not available. Employing neural network approximation idea, we construct the decentralized output feedback controller. The resulting closed-loop system is stable in the sense of semiglobal boundedness. In this paper, the designed decentralized observer and controllers are independent of the time delays. Finally, computer simulations are done to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the main results.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, little work has been done on the system considered in this paper. The main contributions of the paper are as follows. 1) A new recursive method is developed to investigate the output feedback control problem for a class of interconnected systems with time delays and the designed observer-based controller can render the closed-loop system asymptotically stable. 2) Neural network method is used to deal with the output feedback control problem with the bounding functions unknown and the output feedback controller with adaptive law is proposed to render the closed-loop system stable in the sense of semiglobal boundedness. 3) The recursive method proposed in this paper can also be used to investigate the control problem of nonlinear systems free of time delays, and the output feedback controller design method is simpler than that of former literature.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, system descriptions along with necessary assumptions are given. The preliminary knowledge on radial basis function (RBF) neural network is introduced in Section III. In Section IV, the observer and the output feedback controller are designed. The neural network controller is proposed with corresponding adaptive law in Section V. Simulation example is given in Section VI to verify the validity of the main results. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section VII with a brief discussion of the results obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM FORMULATION</head><p>In this paper, we investigate a class of large-scale dynamic systems whose th subsystem can be put into the following normal form: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is total number of the subsystems which is known for controller design, is the state of the subsystem and represents the state of zero dynamic system (not available for feedback),</p><p>, and are the control input and the output of subsystem, respectively.</p><p>, and are smooth nonlinear functions with</p><p>. The time-varying delays are bounded and satisfy , and . The initial values of system ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) are where and are given continuous function vectors, and . The solution of system (1) is and ; for simplicity, we use and to represent the solution in the rest part. In view that the nonlinear functions of system (1) are smooth, then the local Lipschitz condition is satisfied, thus there exists a unique solution for system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>The structure involved in (1) free of time delays has been investigated by several earlier papers in the nonlinear control literature such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. System (1) can be used to represent many important physical systems, for example, cold rolling mills, wind tunnel, and water resources systems (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and the references therein). The system can be seen as a model of the global normal form of input/output feedback linearization for large-scale time-delay system. For system (1), the following additional conditions are assumed.</p><p>Assumption 1: There exists an input-to-state stable (ISS) Lyapunov function for the -system in (1) with and as the input. Namely, there are known classfunctions , and satisfying</p><p>(2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Assumption 2: Function vector yields (3)</formula><p>where is a known function vector, and , and are known matrices with ; here, is an identity matrix. (5) Remark 1: Assumption 1 is to guarantee that the nominal model of uncertain system (1) is minimum phase. This assumption implies that -subsystem is ISS with and as the inputs. The function is required to satisfy Assumption 2, which includes measurable output and the unmeasured state with . This assumption is looser than that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, function only contained the measurable output</p><p>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the assumption on function did not use the good characteristic of the triangular structure and large (upper bounds of uncertainties) induced no solution of [26, eq. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)]. In Assumption 2, we employ the matrices , and to express the function and the triangular structure characteristic is used. Compared with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the observer design condition of this paper [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>] is looser.</p><p>Remark 2: For Assumption 3 with and , we can find that the interconnections among the subsystems should be bounded by nonlinear functions which include the unmeasured state variable , delayed output , and the measured output . We impose Assumption 4 on the functions to guarantee that one can choose functions in the virtual control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> to render the whole system stable, which can be seen in Section IV.</p><p>Remark 3: Instead of Assumption 3, we may assume that function satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where and are known positive functions, and and are nonlinear functions. This condition is often assumed by investigating the decentralized control problem of interconnected systems in existing literature such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. It is easy to find that if inequality (6) holds inequality (4) will stand by choosing and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Since inequality (4) holds for arbitrary variables and , then functions satisfy for arbitrary variable .</p><p>In this paper, the following problem will be investigated. Problem: For system (1) satisfying aforementioned assumptions, we design the decentralized output feedback controller to render the closed-loop system stable. In detail, we consider to design the following decentralized dynamic output feedback controller:</p><p>(8) 1) With the functions and known, the decentralized output feedback controller will be designed such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.</p><p>2) With the functions and unknown, the decentralized adaptive neural network output feedback controller will be constructed to render the closed-loop system stable in the sense of semiglobal boundedness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PRELIMINARIES</head><p>In the control engineering, RBF neural network is usually used as a tool for modeling nonlinear functions because of their good capabilities in function approximation. The RBF neural network can be considered as a two-layer network in which the hidden layer performs a fixed nonlinear transformation with no adjustable parameters, i.e., the input space is mapped into a new space. The output layer then combines the outputs in the latter space linearly, therefore, they belong to a class of linearly parameterized networks. In this paper, the following RBF neural network is used to approximate the continuous function : <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where the input vector and is the neural network input dimension. Weight vector , the NN node number , and , with chosen as the commonly used Gaussian function, which is in the following form: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where is the center of the receptive field and is the width of the Gaussian function.</p><p>It has been proven that the neural network can approximate any continuous function over a compact set to arbitrary accuracy as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where is ideal constant weight and is the approximation error.</p><p>The ideal weight vector is an artificial quantity required for analytical purposes. is defined as the value of that minimizes for all in a compact region, i.e., (12) Neural network approximation idea has been extensively applied to the controller design for uncertain nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, neural network state feedback controllers were constructed for time-delay nonlinear systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the deterministic learning mechanism and the neural learning control scheme were presented. For nonlinear MIMO systems, neural network controllers were constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. With the control direction unknown, the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> designed the neural network controller for nonlinear system with triangular structure. Observer-based output feedback controller was designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, decentralized state feedback controllers were constructed for interconnected nonlinear systems via adaptive neural network. In this paper, we will use the neural networks to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and construct the dynamic output feedback controller. The corresponding decentralized neural network controller with the adaptive law will be proposed in Section V.</p><p>In this paper, the following lemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> is used to prove our main result.</p><p>Lemma 1: Assume that the functions are such that as . Then, there exists a smooth nondecreasing function such that for all .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ROBUST CONTROLLER DESIGN</head><p>In this section, we design a robust output feedback control law for the control task stated in Section II. First, an observer is designed. Then, based on the new augmented system, it is shown how to recursively construct a dynamic output feedback law. Finally, an appropriate choice of the design parameters and functions gives a solution of the aforementioned stabilization problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Observer Design</head><p>The following standard decentralized observer is proposed: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where and parameters are chosen such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where matrices and are positive definite, is a positive scalar, and matrix is defined as . . . </p><note type="other">.</note><p>Further with ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), the composite system is obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where and . With the help of inequality (4), one has <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> Therefore, if we design the controller to render the composite system ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) stable, it will also render the system (1) stable.</p><p>Remark 4: To solve inequality ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), we decompose with . . . and , then inequality ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) can be solved via the following LMI: <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> where and are positive matrices, and is an unknown vector. For the given matrices and and positive matrix , one can solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> to get matrices and and scalar simultaneously via LMI toolbox of Matlab. Furthermore, the observer gain vector can be obtained by .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Controller Design</head><p>For the composite system (16), we consider the following state coordinate transformation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where functions are the virtual control laws satisfying . Under the transformation (19), system ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is changed into <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> In the following part, we will decide how to choose the virtual control law and design the decentralized control input for the composite system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. First, we have the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 1: For system (20), choose the Lyapunov Krasovskii functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> where and are positive scalars. Then, there exist virtual control inputs such that the time derivative of along system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> satisfies in which where is the nonlinear function to be defined, and and are positive scalars. Proof: According to Assumption 3, one can see that is positive definite, then is a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Now, let us consider the time derivative of along system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</p><p>First, the time derivative of along <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> satisfies With ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), it yields</p><p>Along system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, the time derivative of satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> and time derivative of yields for ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> Based on ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">23</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">27</ref>), we get <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> The time derivative of satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> Based on ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">31</ref>), we choose the following virtual control inputs: <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> and for <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> Further, the decentralized output feedback controller is designed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> With virtual control inputs defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> and control input <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> for system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, one has <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> then the proof is completed for the lemma. In the following section, we will show how to obtain function and analyze the stability problem of the closed-loop system.</p><p>Remark 5: The existence of time delays renders the control problem more difficult than that of controlling the nonlinear systems free of the time delays. Different from the classic backstepping method, here the virtual control law designed in the first step should not only include the information of subsystem but also include the information of subsystem. With obtained in the first step, we can further get and controller via step by step method. In the first step, we add the function , which is used to eliminate the impact from the -subsystem. Especially, if there is no zero dynamics in the system, we choose , then the time derivative of Lyapunov functional yields It is easy for us to see that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.</p><p>We will formulate one of our main results in this paper. Theorem 1: Under Assumptions 1-4, the dynamic output feedback controller ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">32</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">34</ref>) renders the resulting closedloop system asymptotically stable.</p><p>Proof: With the help of Assumption 1, one has By employing the changing supply functions idea proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, we define <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> where means that , and function is a positive smooth nondecreasing function. It is clear that is a positive-definite function. We know Now, let us consider the following three cases. The first case is that and hold for all and . For this case, one has <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> The second case is that and hold for all and . Then, the following two inequalities hold: and With the two inequalities, one has <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> The third case is that or hold for some and . One can see that inequality (38) also stands for this case. Therefore, inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> always holds for the three cases. With <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, one obtains Based on Lyapunov stability theorem, the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.</p><p>Remark 6: In the controller design procedure, we tend to choose small parameter in virtual control input to avoid the high control gain. However, small may induce that the inequality cannot hold. To overcome the drawback, we may first choose a small parameter and then solve the following inequality:</p><p>where is a given positive matrix satisfying . This inequality is equivalent to the following LMI:</p><p>where . With the given matrices , and solving the previous LMI gives parameter and matrices and . In this section, we investigated a large class of interconnected time-delay systems with zero dynamics in each subsystem. The observer is designed and the gain parameters are obtained by solving LMI. Using the recursive method, we design the observer-based output feedback controller. Finally, by employing the changing supplying function idea, we show that the closedloop system is asymptotically stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. ADAPTIVE NEURAL NETWORK CONTROL</head><p>In Section IV, we illustrated the design procedure of decentralized output feedback controller for the case that the functions and are known. However, in practical systems, they may be unavailable. For this case, the adaptive neural network can be a good choice as an approximator.</p><p>For system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> with functions and known, we chose virtual control input as where If functions and are unknown, is not available, then will not be used in the first step of the recursive design procedure. From the knowledge of Section III, there exists an optimal parameter such that in a given compact set . We select as <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> where is used to approximate nonlinear function and is the tuned parameter with adaptive law <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> where is a positive matrix and is a positive scalar.</p><p>Similarly to the recursive method in Section IV, for subsystem (16), we choose the following state transformation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> where functions are the virtual control inputs, which will be determined in the following parts. With <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, subsystem ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is changed into <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref> For system <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, we choose the following Lyapunov functional: For the whole system, we choose the following Lyapunov functional:</p><p>(58) where is the same as defined in Section IV. Similarly, there exist functions and such that the following inequality holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(59)</formula><p>Then, one has the following Theorem.</p><p>Theorem 2: For the system (42) satisfying Assumption 1-4 with the functions and unknown, the designed dynamic output feedback controller [see ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">39</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">40</ref>), (49), and (51)] renders the corresponding closed-loop system stable in the sense of semiglobal boundedness.</p><p>Based on Lyapunov stability theory, from (59), we know that the system state will converge to the following region: where denotes the minimum eigenvalue of matrix . According to inequality (61), we know that is bounded, then the continuous virtual control input <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> is bounded. Further, is bounded, so is also bounded with the state transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. By the recursive method, we find that is bounded. For the bounded in (61), it is easy for us to see that the state of system (1) is also bounded. In addition, based on inequality (61), we have then the internal state is also bounded. Therefore, the solution of the resulting closed-loop system is bounded.</p><p>Remark 7: For neural network approximation, we may first estimate the domain of the approximation function, then choose the center and width of NN node. In the previous, we use the neural network to approximate function , which includes design parameters and . If the parameters and are large, then more NN nodes are needed for good approximation, which will render the controller structure more complex. We may first choose small parameters and . With , one may solve the LMI in Remark 6 to obtain the observer gain matrix . Then, the decentralized output feedback neural network controller with fewer nodes can be constructed. From (59), one knows that the time derivative of will be less than zero outside the compact set where and . This compact set can be rendered small by choosing adjustable parameters and matrices . We choose a big compact such that at first. The initial values of system state are in compact . Based on the compact , we then choose the center and width of NN node. With the NN controller (51), from (59), we see that the state must move in a direction of a decreasing Lyapunov function thus the state will stay in the compact set the whole time and finally converge to the compact set .</p><p>Remark 8: In this part, the dynamic output feedback control problem for the large-scale nonlinear systems with time delays is investigated via adaptive neural network method. For the nonlinear interconnected systems free of time delays, the state feedback control problem is investigated via adaptive neural network method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, but little attention is focused on output feedback controller design problem. By letting the delay time be zero, the main results of this paper can be employed to construct the decentralized adaptive output feedback neural network controller for interconnected nonlinear systems free of the time delays.</p><p>Remark 9: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the central output feedback control problem is investigated for a class of nonlinear systems via neural network and at each step one NN is used to approximate a nonlinear function. For an -order nonlinear system, neural networks are used for controller design. In this paper, we consider the decentralized control problem for a large-scale nonlinear systems including subsystems with th subsystem in the order. We use one NN to approximate a composite function at the design of the first virtual control input, thus the controller design complexity is reduced. In this paper, we only use neural networks on controlling the interconnected systems with subsystems. The NN structure of this paper should be differentiated for times which is in contrast to a single differentiation due to overparameterized NN structures in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SIMULATION INVESTIGATION</head><p>In this section, the following interconnected system will be investigated which includes two subsystems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>Dynamic output feedback control problem for nonlinear interconnected systems with time delays was investigated.</p><p>Adaptive neural network was employed to approximate nonlinear function. First, we designed the dynamic output feedback controller with the bounds of nonlinear functions known based on backstepping design method. With the help of changing Lyapunov function idea, we proved that the constructed controllers could render the closed-loop asymptotically stable. Further, we considered the case that the bounds of uncertain interconnections could not be totally obtained. Decentralized adaptive neural network controllers were proposed. Based on  Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, we also showed that the resulting closed-loop system was stable in the sense of semiglobal boundedness. Finally, a numerical example was given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the main results obtained.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Assumption 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Nonlinear interconnection part satisfies (4) where and are the arbitrary timevarying parameter vectors, and are known positive-definite functions with and and are proper smooth nonlinear functions.
