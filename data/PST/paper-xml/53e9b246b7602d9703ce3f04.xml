<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Occurrences of natural disasters have been constantly increasing world wide due to global warming and environmental destructions. The situation is much more severe in developing countries as sophisticated disaster detection technologies are either unaffordable or impractical. Researchers have been attempting to address this global challenge using wireless sensor network (WSN) technology for more than one decade.</p><p>Disasters can be closely monitored by augmenting a variety of sensors, e.g., temperature, displacement, pressure, noises, and concentration of chemicals. WSN is a desirable technology for disaster monitoring for its merits of (1) low cost, e.g., the price of a unit in the wireless early flood detection system proposed by MIT can be $10 each <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>,</p><p>(2) quick response, i.e., capability to capture and deliver relevant data with minimum delay, and this particularly suits for monitoring natural disasters which often burst out in an unpredictable manner, and (3) salability and flexibility, e.g., hundreds or even thousands of sensor nodes can be densely/sparsely deployed in a region of interest without the limitation of cabling and can be easily redeployed/scaled as needed. Applications of disaster monitoring using WSN are in general data intensive for the large number of senor nodes, the high bandwidth requirements and stringent delay constraints. The task demands fast data delivery in largescale and mobile sensor networks. Natural disaster monitoring with WSN, e.g., early warning of geoharzards, often manifests a typical paradigm of data-intensive application upon low-cost scalable system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>WSNs have been successfully utilized for a number of purposes when handling disasters, such as environment monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, pre-disaster forecast and prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, early warning system (EWS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, emergency preparedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, post-disaster response (such as search &amp; rescue) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. In this study, we consider SHM a case of disaster monitoring for its importance in avoiding life loss as an indirect impact of natural disasters, e.g., landslide, earthquake, and tornado. Various methods and techniques in connection with the WSN itself have been proposed to cater for the needs of disaster monitoring, including network organizations and architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, routing algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, and sensor node structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the many existing research efforts and applications along this direction, it is still a young and emerging area. New researchers in this area are often bewildered by the many aspects that they need to consider when designing/studying WSNs for natural disasters. There is a need to provide an up-to-date review of existing work of this emerging technology. In this article, we described a clear classification of some representative work with the major features and related techniques. It can be observed that the existing work can be generally categorized by two specifications:</p><p>(1) Domain of applications of the WSN used for natural disasters, e.g., whether targeting on buildings or a natural environment of large scale; whether the WSN for monitoring the targets before or during or after the disasters; and (2) Aiming at these different applications, especially extreme requirements in data processing, various optimization methods have been developed, which significantly distinguish WSNs for disasters from general-purpose WSNs.</p><p>Early warning on geohazards in developing country, taking the Three-gorge reservoir area with Yangtze river for a typical example, is extremely important. Due to the complex terrain and geological conditions as well as the gigantic water body of the dam, the reservoir area is prone to landslides, collapses, cracks, and earthquake. In this scenario, early warning for geohazards plays a vital role in disaster prevention to save lives and reduce losses in the huge reservoir area. The focus of early warning include the type, timing, location, and scale (or magnitude) of the potential disasters as well as the area to be influenced and the damages. Various signs may exist prior to a geologic disaster. Early warning can help in monitoring and identifying these signs in time to support swift responses to the potential geologic disasters.</p><p>In this study, we proposed an approach upon WSN for early warning on geohazards. Setup of sensors of the WSN is a priory issue. Various types of sensors may apply, e.g., interior displacement sensors, apparent displacement sensors, solid settle sensors, rainfall sensors, and water pressure sensors. Information collected by these sensors is first transferred to the base station via wireless multi-hop transmission then the monitoring center via wireless wide area network. The government agency may makes decisions with these information. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> gives an overview of the system. The architecture (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) of the overall system consists of three levels: field sensing, remote networks, and monitoring center. The field monitoring level is responsible for data transmission and data reliability test for the WSN. The remote networks transfer field information to the monitoring center. The monitoring center performs data analysis and visualization to support geohazard monitoring and management. On the monitoring spot, real-time information collection and flexible organization of the network are the key to system's reliable and stable operations.</p><p>Sensor nodes (namely MicroRF-201) are responsible for capturing geohazard's information, i.e., pressure and deformation. MicroRF-201 has been designed by our research group inspired by the successes of ZIC2410 <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Each node consists of an intelligent output sensor, a wireless network module, and a power management module. A method of data reconstruction and data fusion has been suggested to handle the vast amount and diversity of sensory data. Devices of various types cooperate under a same environment with a unified communication network established. To tackle the challenges imposed by the harsh environment with geohazards, we proposed an approach to reliable real-time data transmission and minimization of energy consumption. The approach achieves the first goal through (1) a dynamic routing protocol to find a route which can satisfy restrictions of frequency width, power consumption, time-lag, packet loss percentage, and number of hops, (2) network recovery under uncertain conditions, and (3) management of mobile nodes to ensure emergency-driven event transmission while reducing network maintenance cost. We then developed a distributed iterative algorithm to reduce the energy consumption and improve utility of network. The algorithm considers the frangibility and speciality of the cluster head with higher priority endowed. The joint optimization model of power and rate is then given using a The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the major application domains of WSNs for natural disaster monitoring. Section 3 highlights typical work on optimization of WSNs in terms of network architecture, deployment &amp; localization, sensors &amp; integration, and routing protocol. Section 4 describes the design of early warning on geohazards using WSN, which includes (1) the system design and (2) the approaches to reliable real-time data transmission and minimization of energy consumption. Experimental results are also presented. Section 5 concludes the paper with a summary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Application domains of WSNs in disaster monitoring</head><p>This section briefs typical systems for disaster forecast, emergency response, and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> categorizes the major applications of WSNs for natural disaster monitoring. WSNs may function at different timings or stages in the process of a disaster. A variety of calamities may be predicted and detected on occurrences. Emergency response works on the onset of the disaster. WSNs can be used in the process of a disaster, e.g., disaster detection and disaster data collection. For example, the remote wireless damage detection system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> detects the disaster by monitoring the health status of structures and other objects, and it collects data from those structure during or after the disaster. For search &amp; rescue operations, these are usually carried out during or after the disaster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Disaster forecast</head><p>WSN has successful applications in dealing with geohazards. Some systems can recover from the damage caused by landslide and transmit urgent data via construction of autonomous sensing node network <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The sensing node network operates robustly to the loss/insertion of sensing node and the dynamic control of data transmission. The Ubiquitous Sensor Network (USN) based real-time slope monitoring system can collect and analyze slope movement data from tiltmeters <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Early warning system (EWS) for flooding is very important especially in developing countries. A WSN-based water management framework, namely Aqua-net, provides an efficient and reliable water management <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The Urban-Flood Common Information Space (CIS) framework facilitates the creation, deployment and operation of early warning systems for this purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Drought forecast and wildfire detection have also been enabled by combining WSN, embedded multimedia communications, and a neural network decision technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. WSNs can function in sandstorm monitoring the the development process of a sandstorm from its origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Emergency response</head><p>WSN is a promising technology in emergency response, which helps in search &amp; rescue as well as medical care. Such systems can detect signs of life and hazards threatening the rescue operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Ad hoc sensor network can provide the rescue teams with a quickly deployable, costeffective, and reliable tool to collect information about the presence of people in a collapsed building space and the state of the ruins <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Systems like MEDiSNA can monitoring patients' physiological data during disaster events <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. MEDiSN comprises patient-worn motes for carrying physiological data, which can scale from tens to hundreds motes.</p><p>Disaster responders require timely delivery of high volumes of accurate data to make correct decisions. An ad hoc wireless architecture responds to disaster with distributed collaborative sensing and accurate localization in difficult environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. After a natural disaster strikes buildings, the WSN's capability of retrieving the related local information is vital for efficient search &amp; rescue operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Structural health monitoring</head><p>Damage detection and characterization strategy for engineering structures are important as those are directly influenced by natural disasters. WSNs can apply in overseeing the integrity, durability and reliability of buildings and bridges etc. Such SHM applications typically acquires tens of thousands data points with sampling frequencies higher than 100 Hz and the span of sampling time in minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. A designer of SHM applications needs to tackle problems of data aggregation including (a) huge data size, (b) liability of data loss, and (c) limited communication range. Different aspects of SHM may be handled by augmenting multiple types of sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>:</p><p>1. Structural global monitoring, using wireless digital acceleration sensors; 2. Swing monitoring of large-scale hook structures, using wireless inclination sensor systems; 3. Structural local monitoring, wireless acquisition systems integrating with different sensing materials.</p><p>WSN techniques were first proposed for structure health monitoring more than one decade ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, and their system adopts smart sensors and wireless communication technologies to remotely monitor the health of large civil structures. Techniques along this direction evolved quickly to adapt to more sophisticated systems to handle increasing number of structural collapses and slope failures. To enhance the accuracy of fire alarm detection, Koo et al. proposed a WSN monitoring framework. The proposed system applied 3D visualization and AR technology to cameraenabled mobile devices in WSN environment thus to gather much more information than conventional fire alarm detection approaches do <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Summary</head><p>WSNs apply in environment monitoring, forecast (predisaster), and emergency response (post-disaster). Numerous evidences indicate the usefulness of WSNs for environment monitoring and early warning. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> presents an overview of existing work from this perspective. Natural disaster monitoring raises a number of research challenges regarding the WSN technology: (1) huge sensory data, (2) deployment in harsh conditions, (3) heterogeneity in data sources, (4) unreliable communication, (5) node failure, and (6) unsustainable power supply.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Technologies for optimization of wireless sensor networks</head><p>Efforts have been made to improve or customize WSN at the levels of sensor, network, and system. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> presents the technologies adopted in WSN at each level in connection with disaster monitoring. The first issue is to manage and integrate various types of sensors to fulfill different purposes in disaster monitoring. The optimization approaches also cover the aspects of network architecture, deployment &amp; localization, sensors &amp; integration, and routing &amp; protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sensors and integration</head><p>A solution to integrating legacy data collection sensors to the WSN grid has been introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The approach paves the way to effective field-deployable communications and telemetry support for rescuers during major natural disasters. Erman et al. managed to develop a platform that integrates different classes of sensors into a disaster response setting, providing event detection, autonomous network repair and quick responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Rises in natural disasters have increased the demands for autonomous devices. Kotzian et al. presented an autonomous device with the ability to reach a designated position, to detect its environment and to multifunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Marin-Perianu et al. proposed using vehicles on wheels, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> Technologies of WSN in disaster monitoring augmented with wireless, sensing, and control capabilities as mobile nodes. The vehicles are organized in a leader and followers structure and the leader vehicle is controlled by the user remotely <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Such a coordinated team of mobile wireless sensor and actuator nodes can play very important role in the field of disaster management and mapping unknown areas.</p><p>In the AWARE project <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, a platform provides the functionalities required for the cooperation of aerial robots with ground sensor-actuator wireless networks. The project demonstrates the self-deployment, self-configuration and self-repairing of the network by using autonomous helicopters that transported and deployed sensor nodes and loads. These features are highly relevant in natural and urban environments without pre-existing infrastructure or where the infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.</p><p>In MEDiSN <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Physiological Monitors (PMs) and Relay Points (RPs) can self-organize into a multi-hop wireless backbone for carrying physiological data. The combination of MEDiSN's two-tier architecture and optimized rate control protocols allows it to address the compound challenge of reliably delivering large volumes of data while meeting the QoS requirements of rescue &amp; search.</p><p>Inspired by the advances in biosciences, Li et al. suggested to establish a brain-controlled animal network, the nodes enable data capture, processing, and network communications, and collaborates in routing and forwarding packets for each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. A simple and efficient routing scheme for this special sensor network has also been designed, namely hop-aware flooding. The scheme ensures a much lower redundancy comparing to that of flooding while only incurring slightly higher loss rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Network architecture</head><p>The network architecture of a WSN in disasters should have <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> reliability in topology and data transmission, and (2) adaptability to harsh environment.</p><p>Tufail et al. proposed a WSN topology that uses reliable hotlines between sensor gateways to boost the reliability of end-to-end transmissions by reducing the number of average hops from the source to the sink. A Signature Based Routing (SBR) scheme enables the gateways to make intelligent routing decisions to minimize end-toend delay of communication between the source and the sink <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The capability of dynamically changing topology is also very important to handle frequent disconnections during the sandstorm monitoring. Efficient sandstorm monitoring can still be achieved if appropriate topology has been designed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Takayama et al. constructed a wireless sensing node network system which operated flexibly towards disappear/insert of sensing nodes and urgent data transmission for landslide disaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Their approach makes sensing node network operate in three modes (initializing, measuring and urgent) and autonomous switch amongst these modes. The resulted WSN achieves robustness in dynamic data sensing and transmission. Some sensors may become unreachable due to inhospitable conditions in disasters. Younis et al. proposed reducing the sensitivity of sensor network operation and monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. They used agent sensors that monitored the health, and relayed messages for unreachable sensors. Their approach localizes communication which lowers the amount of sensor energy expended in transmission and enables monitoring of sensor resources and health status. Eventually, network lifetime increases via optimal management of deployed sensors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Deployment and localization</head><p>Conventional WSNs do not generally apply to disaster scenario for (1) a lack of in-network information storage and querying, and (2) inadequate localization methods. Sanson and Mitsuji provided an in-depth study in localization methods and identified their potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Demirbas et al. designed a distributed quad-tree (DQT) structure which exploits location information and geometry of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> and enabls in-network querying in distributed, lightweight, resilient, and energy-efficient manner.</p><p>Computational intelligence has been introduced in WSN deployment and localization, e.g., particle swarm optimization (PSO) and bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA). These algorithms help in deployment of the nodes only in the terrains of interest and accurate localization of sensor nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Suzuki et al. developed an information-gathering system using mobile robots and WSNs in underground spaces in post-disaster environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Mobile robots deploy wireless sensor nodes into the environment to form the communication backbone, and then the WSN can be autonomously deployed and restored by deploying nodes to suitable positions when needed.</p><p>Out-of-power is a common problem of WSN in harsh environments such as natural disasters. It is desirable to ensure that (1) power is maintained at the sensor nodes, and (2) the collection and analysis of data can be automated. Mascarenas et al. utilized a new "mobile host", such as a robot or unmanned aerial vehicle, to charge the node by wireless power delivery and subsequently retrieve the data by wireless interrogation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Routing and protocol</head><p>Energy efficiency, Quality of Service, and reliable communications are critical issues when developing routing algorithms and protocols.</p><p>Wireless sensor nodes with inexpensive hardware or software architecture can achieve energy efficiency by combining a low-power-mode algorithm and a power-aware routing strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Saengudomlert et al. designed a simple multihop protocol that allows contact between individuals and the base station in disaster area. The protocol also proves time and energy efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>For disaster monitoring applications, sensory data should be delivered within the end-to-end deadline to ensure realtime responses. The data otherwise may become useless or misleading. Ryu et al. proposed a mechanism combing scheduling and routing, which provides a deterministic guarantee of end-to-end deadlines <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Early warning on geohazards</head><p>After a natural disaster, existing fixed communications infrastructure is prone to severe damage or even destruction. A proactive routing method can detect the node's destruction threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. It adapts the routes accordingly, before node failure results in broken routes, delay and power consuming route re-discovery. A micro sensor multi-path routing protocol (MSMRP) can avoid the unavailable areas when constructing the routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Silvius et al. have examined rendezvous protocols for ad hoc network establishment in cognitive radio networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> lists the typical system-level technologies for WSN optimization. This section describes a typical case of using WSN for early warning on geohazards. The system covers the four types of optimization approaches suggested by the existing work.</p><p>In the huge reservoir area of Three-gorge, geohazards such as landslide constantly persist as severe threats. In this scenario, early warning plays an important role in handling potential disasters. The focus is to effectively capture various signs prior to a geologic disaster. For example, massive rainfall can cause change of geological structure and eventually result in landslide. Cracks often appear in the front of the landslide body, and doming appears in the slider front. Cracks at the tail of the landslide body can quickly widen and lengthen with more cracks continuously formed. The back of the landslide body sag quickly, and the rock and solid around become loose, or even accompanied by with small-scale collapse phenomena.</p><p>We proposed an early warning system based on a WSN to monitor and identify these signs in time, thus swift responses to the potential geologic disasters can be supported. In addition to detecting these signs, the design mainly concerns reliable real-time data transmission and minimal energy consumption to adapt to the harsh environments under threats.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Design of sensor nodes</head><p>An individual node of the WSN consists of a wireless communication module and a power management module. The wireless communication module (MicroRF-201 series) supports improved Zigbee protocol, ZigBeePRO, to improve interoperations between modules. The module adopts JN5139/JN5148 micro wireless controller because it is a single-chip Zigbee wireless microprocessor offering low energy consumption and memory of the maximum size. With the support of the MicroRF protocol, sleeping strategy can be fully utilized to further reduce energy consumption while assuring reliable data transmission.</p><p>Our design employs a solar panel together with battery to handle the key factor of power supply and management. The node senses the pressure and deformation of the field, which supports real-time detection and communication with the corresponding base station. The internal design of of the nodeis shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. The node normally has a valid communication distance of 300 meters, and this can extend to 3 kilometers in high-power communication mode.  The routers perform data conversion to handle different types of sensors and thus to enable interoperation between the sensors. Conversion between protocols has been enabled which properly solves the problem of data communication amongst devices with heterogenous buses on the spot. Eventually, devices of various types cooperate under a same environment with a unified communication network established.</p><p>We enabled collaborative processing of heterogeneous devices to WSN. Intelligent nodes can communicate and coordinate with each other via a wireless communication channel. The modules upon protocol conversion perform quick data processing that forms the basis of control and information collection for a large and complicated system, i.e., WSN on geohazard monitoring. If we regard each intelligent front-end with functionalities as a collector or executor, the whole communication system is actually a network of sensory collectors or executors. In order to accomplish a special task such as geohazard monitoring, we can fix the physical locations and functions of some selected intelligent nodes as relays. The entire communication system enables resource sharing, high scalability and self-organization capability to the nodes of the WSN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Methods for data transmission</head><p>To develop an geohazard-oriented WSN, designers need to handle challenges incurred by large scale, non-linear dynamics, time-lag, and heterogeneity of system structure. Most existing WSN routing protocols do not apply in this type of scenario. This study proposes a routing protocol for "multi-restriction QoS (Quality of Service)", which finds a route satisfying multiple restricts including band width, power consumption, time-lag, percentage of packet loss, number of hops, and effectiveness of using network resources. The protocol operates through collaborative sensing amongst multiple nodes to enable a monitoring and scheduling mechanism which grantees the level of QoS. A distributed method monitors the incoming data stream of each node. The packets beyond the preset conditions will be discarded or be ignored by lower the QoS requirement. A scheduling method handles packets in competition, i.e., packets from different sources should be delivered to the same target end at the same time, by prioritizing them according the different QoS levels.</p><p>The environment with geohazards is very complex, and the individual wireless sensor nodes initially deployed often fail to form a complete network to effectively cover the whole area under monitoring. In addition, unpredictable death of sensor nodes and reallocation of mobile nodes will also result in disruption of routing. This study utilizes regional redundancy for route recovery. After the nodes on the ground form several regional ad hoc networks, UAVs scan the whole area to organize the secondary network. In the procedure of the development of geohazards, parameters of the geological environment (such as surface displacement, vibration, and rainfall etc) can be collected by the sensors and buffered by the head nodes. UAVs can collect these data and transfer them to the data center for analysis to support early warning. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> illustrates this procedure, in which dotted lines denote the network topology formed by secondary networking. Our approach enables rapid self-recovery of the autonomic network upon a method of searching for neighboring nodes and route recovery with regional redundancy.</p><p>Data transmission of the WSN is driven by emergency events, i.e., data transmission will only be triggered when an event occurs. The sensor node that detects an emergency event usually does not have the exact position information Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> Routing recovery in complex environments when sending report. A mobile node management mechanism then ensures transmission of information including (1) a position update method with low energy consumption, and (2) an event-driven data transfer method to ensure real-time transmission of emergency events while minimizing the cost of network maintenance when idle. All nodes are configured as interrupt triggering, the processing unit will only be notified on occurrence of an event to register the event to the network. On the route to monitoring center, all routers should record the parameters for each data packet flow and monitor the local network resources. This forms the basis of establishing emergent data channels when needed.</p><p>4.4 Joint optimal control of power and rate Section 4.3 gives the constitution of the system and the way it operates. This section introduces the mathematic model of the system, which abstracts the objective as a problem of maximizing the throughput of the WSN under the constraint of limited power supply. We then present a dual decomposition method for adjusting the power within each cluster in a distributed manner. Analysis to the system is also detailed in terms of lifetime and data rate.</p><p>Considering the large number of sensors of WSN in this study especially the harsh working environment of the WSN, limitation on energy resources persists as a problem because battery recharge or change is difficult and solar power may not always work properly in areas like Threegorge. To save energy and prolong the lifetime of the WSN, we developed a power control algorithm with the constraints of acceptable QoS. The WSN can be viewed as a network of clustered wireless nodes as illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref>. A cluster head is endowed with higher priority and implements a joint optimal model of power and data rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Network model</head><p>Assumed that there are M sensor nodes in the sensing region, and N clusters are set up as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.

Because the cluster head performs much more tasks of relay and forwarding than the rest nodes do, it is likely to the bottleneck of the network.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>Recent years have witnessed a huge interest in monitoring and management of natural disasters using the wireless sensor network technology from researchers and government agencies, with many systems being constructed and many projects being conducted. However, natural disaster monitoring with WSN is still a relatively young research area, and technologies along this direction is far from mature. Natural disaster monitoring is very complex and imposes a number of challenges mainly due to huge scales, uncertainties, and harsh environments. WSN-based natural disaster monitoring systems excel in terms of cost, speed of response, salability and flexibility in contrast to conventional approaches. In general, disaster monitoring with WSN manifests a typical paradigm of data-intensive application upon low-cost scalable system.</p><p>In this study, we first gave an overview of the research and development of this area. We classified representative existing work along the dimensions of the domains of application and optimization methods on WSNs at the levels of sensor, network, and system. This classification helps a researcher to clearly see how existing research and development efforts are distributed. We hope that these discussions provide the readers with useful information and insights on the state of the art of the technologies in WSN for disaster monitoring as well as future research directions.</p><p>Inspired by the existing work, we designed an early warning system upon WSN for geohazards in a reservoir region. In the system design, we developed optimization approaches concerning sensor, network, and energy. An individual sensor uses MicroRF-201 series for wireless communication (distance of 300 meters to 3 kilometers) empowered by Zigbee protocol, and its design supports low energy consumption and has a memory of the maximum size. Reliability and real-time transmission have been enabled at the network level. The approach relies on (1) a dynamic routing protocol, (2) networking recovery under uncertain conditions, and (3) management of mobile nodes. Data fusion and reconstruction approaches have been developed to handle the huge size, the heterogeneity of data sources and types. The entire communication system can easily enable resource sharing, high scalability and selforganization capability to the nodes of the WSN.</p><p>In this study, we emphasized improving utility of network and minimizing the energy consumption as far as the harsh environment the system designed for is concerned. A distributed algorithm for joint optimal control of power and rate has been developed. In wireless sensor networks, network throughput and energy consumption are two important and contradictive specifications in protocol design. We viewed the WSN as a network of clustered wireless. A cluster head is endowed with higher priority and implements a joint optimal model of power and data rate. The joint optimization model of power and rate is given by a dual decomposition method. We evaluated the performance of the overall joint optimization model versus LEACH. Experimental results show that the joint optimization model has a significantly larger number of alive nodes which ensures a longer network lifetime.</p><p>Through this study, we indicate the potentials of the proposed approach in adapting to the needs of early warning on geohazards. The WSN is a very promising technology in monitoring and management of natural disasters.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Overview of the early warning system</figDesc><graphic coords="3,184.29,61.61,352.36,231.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
