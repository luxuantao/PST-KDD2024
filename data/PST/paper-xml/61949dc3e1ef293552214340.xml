<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Topic models extract groups of words from documents, whose interpretation as a topic hopefully allows for a better understanding of the data. However, the resulting word groups are often not coherent, making them harder to interpret. Recently, neural topic models have shown improvements in overall coherence. Concurrently, contextual embeddings have advanced the state of the art of neural models in general. In this paper, we combine contextualized representations with neural topic models. We find that our approach produces more meaningful and coherent topics than traditional bag-of-words topic models and recent neural models. Our results indicate that future improvements in language models will translate into better topic models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>One of the crucial issues with topic models is the quality of the topics they discover. Coherent topics are easier to interpret and are considered more meaningful. E.g., a topic represented by the words "apple, pear, lemon, banana, kiwi" would be considered a meaningful topic on FRUIT and is more coherent than one defined by "apple, knife, lemon, banana, spoon." Coherence can be measured in numerous ways, from human evaluation via intrusion tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chang et al., 2009)</ref> to approximated scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lau et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Röder et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>However, most topic models still use Bag-of-Words (BoW) document representations as input. These representations, though, disregard the syntactic and semantic relationships among the words in a document, the two main linguistic avenues to coherent text. I.e., BoW models represent the input in an inherently incoherent manner.</p><p>Meanwhile, pre-trained language models are becoming ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP), precisely for their ability to cap-ture and maintain sentential coherence. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, the most prominent architecture in this category, allows us to extract pre-trained word and sentence representations. Their use as input has advanced state-of-the-art performance across many tasks. Consequently, BERT representations are used in a diverse set of NLP applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Rogers et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nozza et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Various extensions of topic models incorporate several types of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Xun et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhao et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Terragni et al., 2020a)</ref>, use word relationships derived from external knowledge bases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Terragni et al., 2020b)</ref>, or pre-trained word embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Das et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dieng et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nguyen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhao et al., 2017)</ref>. Even for neural topic models, there exists work on incorporating external knowledge, e.g., via word embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gupta et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gupta et al., , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dieng et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we show that adding contextual information to neural topic models provides a significant increase in topic coherence. This effect is even more remarkable given that we cannot embed long documents due to the sentence length limit in recent pre-trained language models architectures.</p><p>Concretely, we extend Neural ProdLDA (Product-of-Experts LDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Srivastava and Sutton, 2017)</ref>, a state-of-the-art topic model that implements black-box variational inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ranganath et al., 2014)</ref>, to include contextualized representations. Our approach leads to consistent and significant improvements in two standard metrics on topic coherence and produces competitive topic diversity results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contributions</head><p>We propose a straightforward and easily implementable method that allows neural topic models to create coherent topics. We show that the use of contextualized document embeddings in neural topic models produces significantly more coherent topics. Our results suggest that topic models benefit from latent contextual information, which is missing in BoW representations. The resulting model addresses one of the most central issues in topic modeling. We release our implementation as a Python library, available at the following link: https://github.com/MilaNLProc/ contextualized-topic-models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Neural Topic Models with Language Model Pre-training</head><p>We introduce a Combined Topic Model (Com-binedTM) to investigate the incorporation of contextualized representations in topic models. Our model is built around two main components: (i) the neural topic model ProdLDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Srivastava and Sutton, 2017)</ref> and (ii) the SBERT embedded representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Reimers and Gurevych, 2019)</ref>. Let us notice that our method is indeed agnostic about the choice of the topic model and the pre-trained representations, as long as the topic model extends an autoencoder and the pre-trained representations embed the documents.</p><p>ProdLDA is a neural topic modeling approach based on the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). The neural variational framework trains a neural inference network to directly map the BoW document representation into a continuous latent representation. Then, a decoder network reconstructs the BoW by generating its words from the latent document representation<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . The framework explicitly approximates the Dirichlet prior using Gaussian distributions, instead of using a Gaussian prior like Neural Variational Document Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Miao et al., 2016)</ref>. Moreover, ProdLDA replaces the multinomial distribution over individual words in LDA with a product of experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hinton, 2002)</ref>. We extend this model with contextualized document embeddings from SBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Reimers and Gurevych, 2019)</ref>, 2 a recent extension of BERT that allows the quick generation of sentence embeddings. This approach has one limitation. If a document is longer than SBERT's sentence-length limit, the rest of the document will be lost. The document representations are projected through a hidden layer with the same dimensionality as the vocabulary size, concatenated with the BoW representence-transformers sentation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> briefly sketches the architecture of our model. The hidden layer size could be tuned, but an extensive evaluation of different architectures is out of the scope of this paper.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Setting</head><p>We provide detailed explanations of the experiments (e.g., runtimes) in the supplementary materials. To reach full replicability, we use open-source implementations of the algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Datasets</head><p>We evaluate the models on five datasets: 20News-Groups<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , Wiki20K (a collection of 20,000 English Wikipedia abstracts from Bianchi et al. ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>)), Tweets2011<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , Google News <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Qiang et al., 2019)</ref>, and the StackOverflow dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Qiang et al., 2019)</ref>. The latter three are already pre-processed. We use a similar pipeline for 20NewsGroups and Wiki20K: removing digits, punctuation, stopwords, and infrequent words. We derive SBERT document representations from unpreprocessed text for Wiki20k External word embeddings topic coherence (α) provides an additional measure of how similar the words in a topic are. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ding et al. (2018)</ref> and first compute the average pairwise cosine similarity of the word embeddings of the top-10 words in a topic, using <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mikolov et al. (2013)</ref> embeddings. Then, we compute the overall average of those values for all the topics. We can consider this measure as an external topic coherence, but it is more efficient to compute than Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information on an external corpus.</p><p>Inversed Rank-Biased Overlap (ρ) evaluates how diverse the topics generated by a single model are. We define ρ as the reciprocal of the standard RBO <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Webber et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Terragni et al., 2021b)</ref>. RBO compares the 10-top words of two topics. It allows disjointedness between the lists of topics (i.e., two topics can have different words in them) and uses weighted ranking. I.e., two lists that share some of the same words, albeit at different rankings, are penalized less than two lists that share the same words at the highest ranks. ρ is 0 for identical topics and 1 for completely different topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Models</head><p>Our main objective is to show that contextual information increases coherence. To show this, we compare our approach to ProdLDA (Srivastava and Sutton, 2017, the model we extend) 7 , and the following models: (ii) Neural Variational Document Model (NVDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Miao et al., 2016)</ref>; (iii) the very recent ETM (Dieng et al., 2020), MetaLDA (MLDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhao et al., 2017)</ref> and (iv) LDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blei et al., 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Configurations</head><p>To maximize comparability, we train all models with similar hyper-parameter configurations.</p><p>The inference network for both our method and ProdLDA consists of one hidden layer and 100dimension of softplus units, which converts the input into embeddings. This final representation is again passed through a hidden layer before the variational inference process. We follow (Srivastava and Sutton, 2017) for the choice of the parameters. The priors over the topic and document distributions are learnable parameters. For LDA, the Dirichlet priors are estimated via Expectation-Maximization. See the Supplementary Materials for additional details on the configurations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>We divide our results into two parts: we first describe the results for our quantitative evaluation, and we then explore the effect on the performance when we use two different contextualized representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Quantitative Evaluation</head><p>We compute all the metrics for 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 topics. We average results for each metric over 30 runs of each model (see Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). As a general remark, our model provides the most coherent topics across all corpora and topic settings, even maintaining a competitive diversity of the topics. This result suggests that the incorporation of contextualized representations can improve a topic model's performance.</p><p>LDA and NVDM obtain low coherence. This result has also also been confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Srivastava and Sutton (2017)</ref>. ETM shows good external coherence (α), especially in 20NewsGroups and Stack-Overflow. However, it fails at obtaining a good τ coherence for short texts. Moreover, ρ shows that the topics are very similar to one another. A manual inspection of the topics confirmed this problem. MetaLDA is the most competitive of the models we used for comparison. This may be due to the incorporation of pre-trained word embeddings into MetaLDA. Our model provides very competitive results, and the second strongest model appears to be MetaLDA. For this reason, we provide a detailed comparison of τ in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, where we show the average coherence for each number of topics; we show that on 4 datasets over 5 our model provides the best results, but still keeping a very competitive score on 20NG, where MetaLDA is best.</p><p>Readers can see examples of the top words for each model in the Supplementary Materials. These descriptors illustrate the increased coherence of topics obtained with SBERT embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Using Different Contextualized Representations</head><p>Contextualized representations can be generated from different models and some representations might be better than others. Indeed, one question left to answer is the impact of the specific contextualized model on the topic modeling task. To answer to this question we rerun all the experiments with CombinedTM but we used different contextualized sentence embedding methods as input to the model. We compare the performance of CombinedTM using two different models for embedding the contextualized representations found in the SBERT repository:</p><p><ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> stsb-roberta-large (Ours-R), as employed in the previous experimental setting, and using bert-base-nli-means (Ours-B). The latter is derived from a BERT model fine-tuned on NLI data. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the coherence of the two approaches on all the datasets (we averaged all results). In these experiments, RoBERTa fine-tuned on the STSb dataset has a strong impact on the increase of the coherence. This result suggests that including novel and better contextualized embeddings can further improve a topic model's performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>In recent years, neural topic models have gained increasing success and interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhao et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Terragni et al., 2021a)</ref>, due to their flexibility and scalability. Several topic models use neural networks <ref type="bibr">(Larochelle and Lauly, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gupta et al., 2020)</ref> or neural variational inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Miao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mnih and Gregor, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Srivastava and Sutton, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Miao et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ding et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Miao et al. (2016)</ref> propose NVDM, an unsupervised generative model based on VAEs, assuming a Gaussian distribution over topics. Building upon NVDM, Dieng et al.</p><p>(2020) represent words and topics in the same embedding space. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Srivastava and Sutton (2017)</ref> propose a neural variational framework that explicitly approximates the Dirichlet prior using a Gaussian distribution. Our approach builds on this work but includes a crucial component, i.e., the representations from a pre-trained transformer that can benefit from both general language knowledge and corpusdependent information. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bianchi et al. (2021)</ref> replace the BOW document representation with pre-trained contextualized representations to tackle a problem of cross-lingual zero-shot topic modeling. This approach was extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mueller and Dredze (2021)</ref> that also considered fine-tuning the representations. A very recent approach (Hoyle et al., 2020) which follows a similar direction uses knowledge distillation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hinton et al., 2015)</ref> to combine neural topic models and pre-trained transformers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We propose a straightforward and simple method to incorporate contextualized embeddings into topic models. The proposed model significantly improves the quality of the discovered topics. Our results show that context information is a significant element to consider also for topic modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical Statement</head><p>In this research work, we used datasets from the recent literature, and we do not use or infer any sensible information.
