<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance of Reduced-Rank Linear Interference Suppression</head><p>Michael L. Honig, Fellow, IEEE, and Weimin Xiao, Member, IEEE Abstract-The performance of reduced-rank linear filtering is studied for the suppression of multiple-access interference. A reduced-rank filter resides in a lower dimensional space, relative to the full-rank filter, which enables faster convergence and tracking. We evaluate the large system output signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) as a function of filter rank for the multistage Wiener filter (MSWF) presented by Goldstein and Reed. The large system limit is defined by letting the number of users and the number of dimensions tend to infinity with fixed. For the case where all users are received with the same power, the reduced-rank SINR converges to the full-rank SINR as a continued fraction. An important conclusion from this analysis is that the rank needed to achieve a desired output SINR does not scale with system size. Numerical results show that = 8 is sufficient to achieve near-full-rank performance even under heavy loads ( = 1). We also evaluate the large system output SINR for other reduced-rank methods, namely, Principal Components and Cross-Spectral, which are based on an eigendecomposition of the input covariance matrix, and Partial Despreading (PD). For those methods, the large system limit lets with fixed. Our results show that for large systems, the MSWF allows a dramatic reduction in rank relative to the other techniques considered.</p><p>Index Terms-Interference suppression, large system analysis, multiuser detection, reduced-rank filters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R EDUCED-rank filtering and estimation have been pro- posed for numerous signal processing applications such as array processing, radar, model order reduction, and quantization (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and references therein). A reduced-rank estimator may require relatively little observed data to produce an accurate approximation of the optimal filter. In this paper, we study the performance of reduced-rank linear filters for the suppression of multiple-access interference.</p><p>Reduced-rank linear filtering has recently been applied to interference suppression in direct-sequence (DS) code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Although conventional adaptive filtering algorithms can be used to estimate the linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detector, assuming short, or repeated spreading codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, the performance may be inadequate when a large number of filter Manuscript received January 10, 2000; revised January 9, 2001.

Madhow, Associate Editor for Detection and Estimation.</p><p>Publisher Item Identifier S 0018-9448(01)04413-3.</p><p>coefficients must be estimated. For example, a conventional implementation of a time-domain adaptive filter which spans three symbols for proposed third-generation wide-band DS-CDMA cellular systems can have over 300 coefficients. Introducing multiple antennas for additional space-time interference suppression capability exacerbates this problem. Adapting such a large number of filter coefficients is hampered by very slow response to changing interference and channel conditions. In a reduced-rank filter, the received signal is projected onto a lower dimensional subspace, and the filter optimization then occurs within this subspace. This has the advantage of reducing the number of filter coefficients to be estimated. However, by adding this subspace constraint, the overall MMSE may be higher than that achieved by a full-rank filter. Much of the previous work on reduced-rank interference suppression has been based on "Principal Components" in which the received vector is projected onto an estimate of the lower dimensional signal subspace with largest energy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>). This technique can improve convergence and tracking performance when the number of degrees of freedom (e.g., CDMA processing gain) is much larger than the signal subspace. This assumption, however, does not hold in a heavily loaded commercial cellular system.</p><p>Our main contribution is to characterize the performance of the reduced-rank multistage Wiener filter (MSWF) presented by Goldstein and Reed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. This technique has the important property that the filter rank (i.e., dimension of the projected subspace) can be much less than the dimension of the signal subspace without compromising performance. Furthermore, adaptive estimation of the optimum filter coefficients does not require an eigendecomposition of the input (sample) covariance matrix. Adaptive interference suppression algorithms based on the MSWF are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Our performance evaluation is motivated by the large system analysis for DS-CDMA with random spreading sequences introduced in [15]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Specifically, let be the number of users, be the number of available dimensions (e.g., chips per coded symbol in CDMA, or number of receiver antennas in a narrow-band system), and be the subspace dimension. We evaluate the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the MSWF as with fixed. For the case where all users are received with the same power, we obtain a closed-form expression for the output SINR as a function of , , and the background noise variance. As increases, this expression rapidly converges to the full-rank large system SINR derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> as a continued-fraction. The MSWF therefore has the surprising property that the dimension needed to obtain a target SINR (e.g., within a small of the full-rank SINR) does not scale with the system size (i.e., and ). Our results show that for moderate to heavy loads, a rank filter essentially achieves full-rank performance, and the SINR for a rank filter is within 1 dB of the full-rank SINR.</p><p>We also evaluate the large system performance of the reduced-rank MSWF given an arbitrary power distribution. A byproduct of this analysis is a method for computing the full-rank large system SINR which does not explicitly make use of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution for the class of random matrices derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, and used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we compare the large system performance of the MSWF with the following reduced-rank techniques. 1) Principal Components, 2) Cross-Spectral <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, and 3) Partial-Despreading <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. (See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.) The Cross-Spectral method is based on an eigendecomposition of the input covariance matrix, but unlike Principal Components, selects the basis vectors which minimize MSE. Partial Despreading (PD) refers to a relatively simple reduced-rank technique in which the subspace is spanned by nonoverlapping segments of the matched filter.</p><p>In contrast with the MSWF, the large system analysis of the latter techniques lets with both and fixed. That is, to achieve a target SINR near the full-rank large system limit, as . For the case where all users are received with the same power, we obtain closed-form expressions which accurately predict output SINR as a function of , , and noise variance. In the next two sections, we present the system model and the reduced-rank techniques considered. In Section IV, we briefly review large system analysis. Our main results are presented in Section V, and numerical examples are presented in Section VI. Proofs and derivations are given in Section VII.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Multistage Wiener Filter (MSWF)</head><p>A block diagram showing four stages of the MSWF is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The stages are associated with the sequence of nested filters where is the order of the filter. Let denote a blocking matrix, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref> Referring to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, let denote the output of the filter , and denote the output of the blocking matrix , both at time . Then the filter for the th stage is determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref> where denotes complex conjugate. For , we have (the desired input symbol), , and is the matched filter . Here we assume that each blocking matrix is , so that each vector is . As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, it will be convenient to normalize the filters so that . The filter output is obtained by linearly combining the outputs of the filters via the weights . This is accomplished stage-by-stage. Referring to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, let <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref> for and . Then is selected to minimize . The rank MSWF is given by the following set of recursions.</p><p>Initialization:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(20)</formula><p>For (Forward Recursion)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(21) (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">) (23)<label>(24)</label></formula><p>Decrement (Backward Recursion)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(25)<label>(26)</label></formula><p>where . The MSWF has the following properties. 1) At stage the filter generates the desired (time) sequence and the "observation" sequence . The MSWF for estimating the former from the latter has the same structure at each stage. The full-rank MMSE filter can, therefore, be represented as an MSWF with stages, where is replaced by the MMSE filter for estimating from .</p><p>2) It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> that <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref> for</p><p>, where and . The following induction argument establishes that is orthogonal to for all . First, it is easily verified from ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) that is orthogonal to . Assume, then, that is orthogonal to for , . We can rewrite ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) as ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref> where is a normalization constant, and the last equality holds since and is orthogonal to . It can then be verified from ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>) that is orthogonal to , or, equivalently, that is orthogonal to for , , which establishes the induction step. The relations ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>) will be useful in what follows.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> it is easily seen that the matrix of basis vectors for the MSWF is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref> where the last equality is due to the fact that the 's are orthogonal. (This implies that the blocking matrices in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> can be replaced by the identity matrix without affecting the variables and , .) An alternate set of nonorthogonal basis vectors is given in the next section.</p><p>3) It is easily shown that each is contained in the signal subspace, hence stages are needed to form the full-rank filter. 4) It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> that <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref> for and . It follows that is tridiagonal. 5) The blocking matrix is not unique. (In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, is assumed to be an matrix, so that is .) Although any rank matrix that satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref> achieves the same performance (MMSE), this choice can affect the performance for a specific data record. In particular, a poor choice of blocking matrix can lead to numerical instability. 6) Computation of the MMSE filter coefficients does not require an estimate of the signal subspace, as do the eigendecomposition techniques to be described. Successive filters are determined by "residual correlations" of signals in the preceding stage. Adaptive algorithms based on this technique are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Eigendecomposition Methods</head><p>The reduced-rank technique which has probably received the most attention is "Principal Components" (PC), which is based on the following eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref> where is the orthonormal matrix of eigenvectors of and is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Suppose that the eigenvalues are ordered as . For a given subspace dimension , the projection matrix for PC is , the first columns of .</p><p>For , the eigenvalues are associated with the signal subspace, and the remaining eigenvalues are associated with the noise subspace, i.e., for . Consequently, by selecting , PC retains full-rank MMSE performance (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>). However, the performance can degrade quite rapidly as decreases below , since there is no guarantee that the associated subspace will retain most of the desired signal energy. This is especially troublesome in a near-far scenario, since for small , the subspace which contains most of the energy will likely correspond to the interference, and not the desired signal. We remark that in a heavily loaded cellular system, the dimension of the signal subspace may be near, or even exceed the number of dimensions available, in which case PC does not offer much of an advantage relative to conventional full-rank adaptive techniques.</p><p>An alternative to PC is to choose a set of eigenvectors for the projection matrix which minimizes the MSE. Specifically, we can rewrite the MSE (6) in terms of reduced-rank variables as (34)</p><p>The subspace that minimizes the MSE has basis vectors which are the eigenvectors of associated with the largest values of , where is the th component of , and is given by , where is the th column of . (Note the inverse weighting of in contrast with PC.) This technique, called "Cross-Spectral" (CS) reduced-rank filtering, was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. This technique can perform well for since it takes into account the energy in the subspace contributed by the desired user. Unlike PC, the projection subspace for CS requires knowledge of the desired user's spreading code . A disadvantage of eigendecomposition techniques in general is the complexity associated with estimation of the signal subspace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Partial Despreading (PD)</head><p>In this method, proposed for DS-CDMA in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, the received signal is partially despread over consecutive segments of chips, where is a parameter. The partially despread vector has dimension , and is the input to the -tap filter. Consequently, corresponds to the full-rank MMSE filter, and corresponds to the matched filter. The columns of in this case are nonoverlapping segments of , the signature for user 1, where each segment is of length .</p><p>Specifically, if , the th column of is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(35)</formula><p>where , prime denotes transpose, and there are zeros on the left and zeros on the right. This is a simple reduced-rank technique that allows the selection of MSE performance between the matched and full-rank MMSE filters by adjusting the number of adaptive filter coefficients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. LARGE SYSTEM ANALYSIS</head><p>Our main results, presented in the next section, are motivated by the large system results for synchronous CDMA with random signature sequences presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Specifically, we evaluate the large system limit of the output SINR for the reduced-rank filters described in the preceding section when the signatures are chosen randomly. This limit is defined by letting the number of dimensions and number of users tend to infinity with held constant.</p><p>The large system results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, as well as some of the results presented here, make use of the limiting eigenvalue distribution of a class of random matrices. Let be an infinite matrix of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex-valued random variables with variance , and be a sequence of real-valued random variables (corresponding to user powers). Let be an matrix, whose th entry is</p><p>. Let be a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries . As , we assume that the empirical distribution function of these entries converges almost surely in distribution to a deterministic limit . In what follows, we will denote the range of for which is nonzero as . For an arbitrary distribution , closed-form expressions for , , and do not exist. However, a closed-form expression for is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> for the case where , , and , (i.e., all users are received with the same power). This will be used in Section VII to derive some of our results.</p><p>The preceding result was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> to derive the large system limit of the output SINR for the linear MMSE filter in a synchronous CDMA system. Specifically, let denote the received power of user , and denote the received power of a random user, which has the limit distribution . Let user 1 be the user of interest. It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> that as , the (random) output SINR of the linear MMSE receiver for user 1 converges in probability to the deterministic limit (38) where (39) is the "effective interference" associated with an interferer received with power .</p><p>For the case where all users are received with the same power, (38) becomes (40) which yields a closed-form solution for <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. It will be convenient to denote this solution as (41) Similary, we will denote the solution to (38) for an arbitrary power distribution as (42) Finally, we remark that the analogous large system limit for the matched filter is (43)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. MAIN RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we present the large system limits of output SINR for the reduced-rank filters presented in Section III. Proofs and derivations are given in Section VII. For finite and , the output SINR is a random variable due to the assignment of random signature sequences. For the MSWF and PD, we are able to show, in analogy with the full-rank MMSE receiver, that the output SINR converges to a deterministic limit as . We conjecture that this is also true for the PC and CS methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Multistage Wiener Filter (MSWF)</head><p>We first state the large system SINR for the MSWF assuming that all users are received with the same power.</p><p>Theorem 1: As , the output SINR of the rank MSWF converges in probability to the limit , which satisfies for (44</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where is the received power for each user, , and is the large system limit of the output SINR for the matched filter.</p><p>The proof is given in Section VII-A. According to this theorem, for finite the output SINR of the MSWF can be expressed as a continued fraction.

Two important consequences of this result are as follows.</p><p>1) The dimension needed to achieve a target SINR within some small of the full-rank SINR does not scale with the system size ( and ). This is in contrast with the other techniques considered, for which the large system output SINR is determined by the ratio . 2) As increases, converges rapidly to the full-rank MMSE.

As stated earlier, we conjecture that the SINR converges to a deterministic large system limit. The technical difficulty in proving this is characterization of the large system limit of where is the th eigenvector of the covariance matrix corresponding to the particular ordering given in Section III-B. Note, in particular, that and are correlated. In order to proceed, we assume that the conjecture is true, and evaluate the corresponding large system limit. The numerical results in Section VI show that the large system results are nearly identical to the corresponding simulation results. For PC, we are only able to evaluate the large system limit for the uniform (equal) power case. In what follows, is the limit distribution for the eigenvalues of (see Section VII-C). For both the PC and CS methods, the output SINR for a rank filter can be written as If in (63) converges to a deterministic large system limit, then this limit must be .

As decreases below , in a near-far situation the performance can be substantially worse than that with equal received powers. For example, assume that there are two groups of users where users in each group have the same power, but users in the first group transmit with much more power than users in the second group. (The groups may correspond to different services, such as voice and data.) In this situation, the eigenvalues corresponding to the signal subspace can also be roughly divided into two sets corresponding to the two user groups. If the desired user belongs to the second group, then its energy is mostly contained in the subspace spanned by eigenvectors associated with the small eigenvalues. Consequently, PC will choose a subspace which contains little energy from the desired user, resulting in poor performance.</p><p>The CS method, described in Section III-B, performs better than the PC method for since it accounts for the projection of the desired user spreading sequence onto the selected subspace.

NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we present numerical results, which illustrate the performance of the reduced-rank techniques considered. Simulation results for a CDMA system with finite and random binary signature sequences are included for comparison with the large system limit. The latter results are averaged over random binary signature sequences and the received power distribution.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref> shows plots of output SINR versus rank for the MSWF with different loads , assuming the background SNR is 10 dB and that all users are received with equal power. Also included are simulation results corresponding to . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> shows the analogous results for different SNRs and fixed load . These results show that the large system limit accurately predicts the simulated values. In all cases shown, the MSWF achieves essentially full-rank performance for . Furthermore, the SINR for is within 1 dB of the full-rank SINR, and the SINR for is approximately midway between the SINRs for the matched-filter and full-rank MMSE receivers.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> shows simulated output SINR for the MSWF as a function of normalized rank for and .

For all four methods considered, the large system analysis accurately predicts the simulation results, which are shown for . As discussed previously, the large system SINR for the MSWF as is the full-rank SINR for any . (Large system results for the MSWF corresponding to finite are not shown.) Consequently, there is a large gap between the curve for the MSWF and the curves for the other methods for small . The CS and PC reduced-rank filters can achieve the full-rank performance only when . For , these results show that the CS filter performs much better than the PC filter.</p><p>The PD filter can achieve the full-rank performance only when , since for any , the selected subspace does not generally contain the MMSE solution. For small , the PD filter performs close to the matched filter, which is significantly better than the eigendecomposition methods. This is because for the latter methods, the desired signal energy is spread over many eigenvectors, so that for small , relatively little desired signal energy is retained in the selected subspace.</p><p>Performance results for nonuniform power distributions are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref>. Two distributions are considered: log-normal, and discrete with two powers. In the former case, the desired user has power , and the log-variance of the log-normal distribution is 6 dB.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have characterized the performance of the reduced-rank MSWF when used for multiple-access interference suppression. For the uniform power case the large system, SINR is easily computed as a continued fraction, and converges rapidly to the full-rank SINR as the rank increases. Numerical results show that this large system analysis accurately predicts average performance for moderately sized systems. We do not have a similar type of simple expression for an arbitrary power distribution, although the performance can be computed numerically. An important conclusion, based on this analysis, is that the rank of the MSWF needed to achieve a target SINR in the neighborhood of the full-rank SINR does not scale with system size. Numerical results show that is sufficient to achieve near full-rank performance for all cases considered.</p><p>The large system SINRs of PC, CS, and PD reduced-rank techniques have also been evaluated. Whether or not the expression for the CS technique is exact is an open question. In all cases, the large system analysis accurately predicts performance for moderately sized systems. Numerical results show that for very small , the techniques based on eigendecomposition perform relatively poorly. The CS filter requires to perform better than the matched filter, and to perform better than PD. PC performs well only when . The MSWF performs significantly better than the other techniques considered for small , and furthermore, does not require explicit tracking of the signal subspace.</p><p>Our results pertain to optimal (MMSE) filters. Adaptive algorithms based on the MSWF are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, and are observed to converge significantly faster than a full-rank Least Squares algorithm. An analysis of the convergence of these adaptive reduced-rank filters with random data is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Investigation of tracking performance in the presence of time-and frequency-selective fading is being pursued.</p></div>
