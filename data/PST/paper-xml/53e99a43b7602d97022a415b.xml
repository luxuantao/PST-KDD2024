<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article review s the growing body of scienti c work in arti cial chemistry. First, common motivations and fundamental concepts are introduced. Second, current research activities are discussed along three application dimensions: modeling, information processing, and optimization. Finally, common phenomena among the different systems are summarized. It is argued here that arti cial chemistries are "the right stuff" for the study of prebiotic and biochemical evolution, and they provide a productive framework for questions regarding the origin and evolution of organizations in general. Furthermore, arti cial chemistries have a broad application range of practical problems, as shown in this review.</p></div>

The pieces should fertilize each other, they should be crossed over, they should be mutated, that is, varied to a small degree, but also to a larger degree by radical changes not known in genetics. This could perhaps happen in some vessels where reactions between "information-carrying molecules" take place, molecules that carry information in a similar way as chromosomes carry the features of organisms. 1  Stanislaw Lem, Summa Technologiae, 1964</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Arti cial Life and Arti cial Chemistry</head><p>One of the main driving forces of science is the quest for understanding the origin and nature of life. For centuries, this quest has caused scientists to collect and systematically describe the diversity of life found everywhere around us. Over many years an impressive collection of data about the processes of life has been amassed. Biology as a traditional life science has sorted and classi ed the data, and-in the course of a century-has made considerable inroads into the understanding of certain aspects of life. The informational perspective, however, has not been the center of interest in biological attempts to approach the issue of life's essence. Arti cial life (AL) research, on the other hand, abstracts from speci c examples of living processes and tries to integrate different approaches into one interdisciplinary attempt to extract the rst principles of life. The working hypothesis of AL research is that biotic phenomena can be modeled by using complex systems of many interacting components. The complex system approach toward an explanation of life employs emergence as a central concept. Emergence is used to deduce global properties of a system from the local interactions between its subsystems. These local interactions may follow simple effective rules that cause global behavior of the system to emerge, but cannot be predicted This article is organized as follows: First it outlines the common motivation for formulating ACs. Then it gives a structured overview of different approaches by means of common and distinctive features (Section 2.1). The following section (Section 2.2) gives a short tutorial on ACs, introducing two illustrative examples. Section 2.3 is devoted to a systematic attempt to classify the different AC approaches. A basis of discriminative features is given, according to which the consecutive lineup in section 3 is structured. The next section (Section 4) gives an overview of projects that make use of some properties of AC in applications. Section 5 deals with observed phenomena common to several approaches and tries to summarize their results. The closing part (Section 6) gives an outlook of future directions and challenges in the area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Basic Concepts</head><p>This section gives an introduction to the basic concepts of arti cial chemistries. Two descriptive examples follow, which should demonstrate concrete implementations. Finally, we try to structure the characteristics of ACs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">What is an Arti cial Chemistry?</head><p>Let us start with a broad de nition: An arti cial chemistry is a man-made system that is similar to a real chemical system. This de nition has been kept as general as possible so as not to exclude any relevant work. When we now become more precise in describing the structure of an arti cial chemistry we should keep in mind that not all AC approaches can be subsumed under the following conceptual framework.</p><p>More formally, an arti cial chemistry can be de ned by a triple (S, R , A), where S is the set of all possible molecules, R is a set of collision rules representing the interaction among the molecules, and A is an algorithm describing the reaction vessel or domain and how the rules are applied to the molecules inside the vessel. Both the set of molecules S and the set of reaction rules R can be de ned explicitly or implicitly (e.g., by an algorithm or mathematical expression). This will be illustrated by two examples in Section 2.2 and discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">The Set of Molecules S</head><p>The set of molecules S D fs 1 , . . . , s i , . . . , s n g, where n might be in nite, describes all valid molecules that may appear in an AC. A vast variety of molecule de nitions can be found in different approaches. For example, molecules may be abstract symbols <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, character sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>, lambda-expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, binary strings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">134]</ref>, numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, hierarchical tree data structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99]</ref>, combinators <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>, or proofs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. A molecule's representation is often referred to as its structure and is set in contrast to its function, which is given by the reaction rules R. The description of valid molecules and their structure is usually the rst step in the de nition of an AC. This step is analogous to the part of chemistry that describes what kind of atomic con gurations form stable molecules and how these molecules appear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">The Set of Rules R</head><p>The set of reaction rules R describes the interactions between molecules s i 2 S. A rule r 2 R can be written according to the chemical notation of reaction rules in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s 1 C s 2 C ¢ ¢ ¢ C s n ! s 0 1 C s 0 2 C ¢ ¢ ¢ C s 0 m (1)</formula><p>A reaction rule determines the n components (objects, molecules) on the left-hand side that can react and subsequently be replaced by the m components on the right-hand side. n may be called the order of the reaction. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> Note that the "C" sign is not an operator here, but only separates the components on either side. A rule is applicable only if certain conditions are ful lled. The major condition is that all of the left-hand side components must be available. This condition can be broadened easily to include other parameters such as neighborhood, rate constants, probability of a reaction, or energy consumption. In such a case a reaction rule would contain additional information or further parameters. Whether or not these additional predicates are taken into consideration depends on the objectives of the AC. If it is meant to simulate real chemistry as accurately as possible, it is necessary to integrate these parameters into the simulation system. If the goal is to build an abstract model, many of these parameters can be omitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Reactor Algorithm A-Dynamics</head><p>An algorithm determines how the set R of rules is applied to a collection of molecules P , called reactor, soup, reaction vessel, or population. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> Note that P cannot be identical to S since some molecules might be present in many exemplars, others not at all.</p><p>Algorithm A depends on the representation of P . In the simplest case, without a spatial structure in P , the population can be represented explicitly as a multiset or implicitly as a concentration vector.</p><p>We shall now summarize the methods by which the dynamics of a reaction vessel (which usually contains a huge number of molecules) can be modeled and simulated. The approaches can be characterized roughly by whether each molecule is treated explicitly or all molecules of one type are represented by a number, their frequency, or concentration.</p><p>(1) Stochastic molecular collisions: In this approach every molecule is explicitly simulated and the population is represented as a multiset P . A typical algorithm draws a sample of molecules randomly from the population P and checks whether a rule r 2 R can be applied. If so, the molecules are replaced by the right-hand-side molecules given by r . If more than one rule can apply, a decision is implemented as to which rule to employ. If no rule can be applied, a new random drawing is initialized. The algorithm, however, is not necessarily restricted to be so simple. Further parameters such as rate constants, energy, spatial information, or temperature can be introduced into the rules for the chemistry to become more realistic.</p><p>The following example is an algorithm used for an AC with second-order reactions only: while:terminate() do s 1 :D draw(P ); The function draw returns a randomly chosen molecule from P (without removing it from P ). The probability that a speci c type is returned is proportional to the concentration of this type in P . The above algorithm does not include an in ux or dilution ux of molecules. This can, however, be added easily. Memory consumption of the algorithm is generally of order O (M ) (i.e., the memory needed to store all molecules is linearly dependent on M , the total number of molecules in the reaction vessel). The explicit simulation of every collision is the lowest level of description. It is very realistic and circumvents some dif culties generated by the collective description we discuss below. There are, however, certain disadvantages for an explicit simulation of every collision. If rate constants or concentrations of molecular species differ by several orders of magnitude the atomic simulation is not ef cient. In addition, if the total number of different molecular species is low or the population is large, an explicit simulation will be slow (see Section 2.1.4).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s 2 :D draw(P ); if 9(s 1 C s 2 ! s 0 1 C s 0 2 C ¢ ¢ ¢ C s 0 m ) 2</formula><p>(2) Continuous differential or discrete difference equations: A common approach to describe the dynamics of a chemical system is to use differential rate equations, which re ect the development of the concentrations of molecular species. The index carried by a molecule now characterizes its species, not its place in the population. A reaction r can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r : a 1 s 1 C a 2 s 2 C ¢ ¢ ¢ C a N s N ! b 1 s 1 C b 2 s 2 C ¢ ¢ ¢ C b N s N</formula><p>where the coef cients a i , b i are the stoichiometric factors of the reaction. They are zero if a species s i does not participate in the reaction (a i D 0 if s i is not a reactant and b i D 0 if it is not a product of the reaction). Let N be the total number of different species in S . The change of the overall concentration <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">4</ref> of s i is expressed with the following system of differential equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d s i dt D (b i ¡ a i ) N Y j D1 s a j j , i D 1, . . . , N .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In order to take into account every reaction r 2 R that possibly contributes to changes of concentration s i one summarizes</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d s i dt D X r2R " (b r i ¡ a r i ) N Y j D1 s a r j j # , i D 1, . . . , N .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Rate equations are a continuous model for a discrete situation. The modeling and simulation of the dynamics by differential equations is an approximation for large numbers of molecules from the same species being present.</p><p>Disadvantages of this approach are: Due to the properties of the numerical solution, concentrations are oating point values and may be so small as to be below the threshold that indicates a single molecule in the reactor. For example, if the assumed population size is 1000, then every further calculation of reactions with s i participating causes unnecessary computational effort if [s i ] is below 0.001 because, in fact, the species s i is no longer present in the reactor. Thus, for the ODE approach to be useful, the number of different molecular species N should be small.</p><p>(3) Metadynamics: This approach toward describing the reaction system acknowledges that the number of species and therefore the number of differential equations may change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The equations at a given time represent the dominant species (a dominant species is a species with a concentration above a certain threshold). As the concentrations change, the dominant species may change, too. Thus the differential equation system is modi ed by adding and/or removing equations. Bagley et al. distinguish between deterministic and stochastic metadynamics. In deterministic metadynamics the reaction graph changes relative to a concentration threshold ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, p. 144). The sequence of graphs is purely deterministic. It explores only the internally catalyzed pathways. In stochastic metadynamics, on the other hand, the physical accuracy of approach ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) is combined with the speed of the deterministic metadynamics approach. (4) Mixed approaches: There are also approaches where single macromolecules are simulated explicitly and a small number of molecules are represented by their concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142]</ref>.</p><p>(5) Symbolic analysis of the equations: If the differential equation system (approach (3)) is simple enough, a symbolic analysis is possible. By solving the equations symbolically the steady-state behavior of the system ( xed point, limit cycle, chaotic behavior, etc.) can be derived. In the mathematical sense, the symbolic approach is the most exact one. It can be combined with the metadynamics approach to calculate the dynamical xed point of the differential equations "in one step." Some researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> used this method with their polymer reaction network, which resulted in a special ODE with only one stable xed point. In the general case, the system is restricted neither to stable attractors nor to xed points. Dynamical behavior of the system, however, cannot be derived from symbolic analysis because it gives insight into the asymptotic behavior only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">A Comparison of the Computational Costs</head><p>To ease the decision about what kind of approach to use for the dynamic simulation in a particular situation we will now compare roughly the computational costs of using explicit molecular collisions versus an ODE system. For the comparison we assume that E is the mean value of the number of molecules participating in each reaction r in R, and N is the number of different species in a population P of size M . We compare the computational effort necessary to perform a single step of the two major approaches: the explicit simulation of reactions and the continuous differential equation approach.</p><p>Explicit stochastic molecular collision: In an explicitly performed simulation, a reaction requires O(E ) draw-operations, followed by O(R ) lookups in the reaction rule set R. Thereafter O(E ) insert-operations are performed for an intermediate update. This leads to the estimation of O (E ) C O(R ) costs for each reaction, which equals O(R ), because in almost every chemistry the total number of different reactions is much larger than the average number of reactants of a single reaction. A full update of the population P thus requires a time of</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">O(R ) ¢ O(M ) D O (R ¢ M )</formula><p>. These computational costs reduce to O (M ) if the lookup of a reaction can be done in O <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, which is the case, for example, if the reaction is implicitly de ned in the structure of a molecule. However, the comparison of the costs in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> assumes an O(R ) lookup.</p><p>Numerical integration of the ODE equations (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>): An integration of the system requires N differential equations, each of which is of order E . The integration has a step length h. An update of the concentration vector E s with a numerical integration method thus has computational costs of O( 1 h ¢ N ¢ E ) function evaluations, because 1 h evaluations of the system with N equations of order E are needed to perform a unit step. So O( 1 h ¢ N ¢ E ) steps have to be performed to have the same progress as M reactions would generate in an explicit simulation with a population P of size M . If a very common integration method like the standard Runge-Kutta method is used, an additional factor of 4 (because of the intermediate steps) needs to be weighed in, so that the overall costs sum up to O (4 Runga-Kutta method uses a xed step length. If the solver uses a variable step length, the parameter h changes accordingly (variable-step-length solvers may be necessary if the rate constants of the reactions differ by several orders of magnitude, which in turn makes the system become stiff). Though constant factors were omitted in the assumption of run-time behavior expressed in O (. . .) terminology, they may play an important role in the calculation of the actual computational effort. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">5</ref> Results of the comparison of the two approaches are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Integration is advantageous if the population is large and the number of species is small. In the opposite case the explicit simulation shows better ef ciency. Which approach to favor if both population size and number of species are large is an unresolved problem and will depend on additional parameters.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">¢ 1 h ¢ N ¢ E ), which equals O( 1 h ¢ N ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.5">Alternative De nition of an Arti cial Chemistry</head><p>There is an alternative way to de ne an arti cial chemistry more naturally, namely by a tuple (S, I ) where S is a set of particles (basic building blocks, functional groups, or atoms) and I a description of the interactions among particles. The advantage of this de nition is that the "arti cial" separation into reaction rules (which specify the "logic" of the transformation of molecules) and algorithm (which de nes the dynamics) is avoided. The form (S, I ) is preferable if interactions or reactions are taking place in the space of the particles or molecules, like in a lattice molecular system (Section 3.7).</p><p>In most cases the reaction between molecules is independent from the description of the reaction vessel and their movement in that vessel, like in Fontana's l chemistry (Section 3.1.4). Under those conditions the form (S , R , A) is preferable.</p><p>The dif culty of separating reactions from dynamics becomes especially clear in Section 3.6 (assembler automata) and Section 3.8.1 (mechanical arti cial chemistries). But in order to be consistent we use the more general form (S, R , A) throughout this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Two Examples</head><p>The rst example demonstrates the relation of an explicit simulation of molecules to their differential equation model. The second example is a constructive AC where molecules and reactions are de ned implicitly. The algorithms are given in detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">A Nonconstructive Explicit Chemistry</head><p>In the following example, we de ne a simple chemical system that consists of two molecular types. Only deterministic second-order catalytic reactions are allowed. Thus a collision of two molecules will catalyze the formation of a speci c third molecule. The two colliding molecules are regarded as catalysts, so they are not changed during the collision. In order to prevent an unlimited growth of the population we assume a maximum reactor size of M and a dilution ux, which keeps the number of molecules M constant in the reactor.</p><p>Molecules: Let the set of molecules be S D fA, Bg. Note that A and B are symbols representing the molecules, and not variables or patterns.</p><p>Reactions: The reaction rules are given explicitly as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r 1 : A C A ¡!

The corresponding differential equations read:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d x A dt D x B x B ¡ x A W (t ), d x B d t D x A x A C 2x A x B ¡ x B W(t ) with W(t ) D (x A C x B ) 2 D 1.

So, the algorithm is similar to the previous one (Section 2.2.1), but additionally includes elastic collisions.</p><p>Discussion: Despite the simple algorithm, the dynamic behavior of the system is fairly interesting. After repeated application of the reaction rule, the whole population tends to eliminate non-prime numbers until it nally consists of primes only (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">6</ref>The concentration of primes shows a typical growth and nally reaches a maximum at c primes D 1.0. The diversity reduces from its initial value to a smaller one through a transient maximum. The AC emerges as a prime factor calculation of the numbers in the reactor. By dividing larger numbers into smaller numbers, the total amount of different numbers increases, until all numbers are divided into their prime factors. The concentration of prime factors increases, and thus the diversity of the population decreases. Finally, all numbers in the reactor are prime factors of the initial population.</p></div>

All possible elements and their behavior are known a priori and their interaction rules do not change during the experiments.</p><p>Implicit: The de nition of the interaction between molecules must refer to their structure. Examples of implicit reaction rules are concatenation or cleavage of polymers. An arti cial chemistry with an implicit reaction scheme allows us to derive the outcome of a collision from the structure of the colliding molecules. The number of possible molecules can be in nite because there is no need for an explicitly de ned interaction scheme. Implicitly de ned interactions are commonly used for constructive chemistries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">De nition of Dynamics: Explicit or Implicit</head><p>The algorithm A of the arti cial chemistry fS, R , Ag now needs to be de ned. The explicit de nition of the system's dynamics has already been given in Section 2.1.3. This de nition is necessary from a computational point of view, because in a computer only the effective execution of a series of formally de ned interactions causes the system to develop and to show a dynamic behavior. The explicit de nition of the dynamics is based on the interactions determined through R and may include various parameters, ranging from temperature, pressure, and pH value to eld effects of secondary or higher-level molecule structures, resulting in an arti cial chemistry that can be used in the eld of computational chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. It is shown in Section 2.2, however, that even a random execution of interactions with no additional parameters causes interesting dynamical phenomena.</p><p>Sometimes, the de nition of interactions makes the additional de nition of A obsolete. This implicit de nition is used, for example, in a cellular automata chemistry, where the dynamics is caused by the synchronous or asynchronous update of lattice sites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">Levels of Abstraction: Analogous or Abstract</head><p>Arti cial chemistries may also be characterized according to their level of abstraction. If there is an isomorphism between a molecule or reaction of the AC to a molecule or reaction in chemistry, respectively, the AC can be called analogous, otherwise it is called abstract. Analogous ACs are considered in the realms of computational chemistry where the goal is to model chemical processes in the computer as closely as possible. What makes an abstract AC a model of chemistry, however, are merely statistical or qualitative features of the reaction laws. The level of abstraction varies and depends on the goals of the modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5">Constructive Dynamical Systems</head><p>In a constructive dynamical system new components can appear, which may change the dynamics of the system. This is different from a conventional dynamical system where all components and interactions are given explicitly at the outset of the process (see the rst example, above).</p><p>A constructive system is called weakly constructive if new components are generated randomly <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. It is called strongly constructive if new components are generated through the action of other components. Natural chemistry is considered to be a strongly constructive system <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>By modeling the dynamical system with differential equations, one can describe a constructive system as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system where equations are modi ed, added and/or removed dynamically. A constructive dynamical system may also be modeled by a xed ODE system with an in nite state space. Mathematical techniques are available to handle such systems, but this approach is not intuitive and has many additional drawbacks. When one uses explicitly simulated molecules the system can be considered constructive if the number of elements that appeared in the system at least once increases in time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6">Random Chemistries</head><p>One of the easiest ways to generate an arti cial chemistry is by drawing random numbers for rate constants or by generating explicit reaction laws randomly. The random autocatalytic systems investigated in Stadler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>, the GARD system <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>, or the metabolic networks in the multicellular organisms reported in Furasawa and Kaneko <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> are examples of nonconstructive random chemistries. It is also possible to generate constructive chemistries randomly by drawing parameters for the reaction laws "on the y" when they are needed as demonstrated by Bagley and Farmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The advantage of random chemistries is that the statistical characteristics of the reaction mechanism can be speci ed arbitrarily. There is, however, an increasing memory consumption through newly appearing molecular species, because every randomly generated reaction law has to be stored explicitly for the whole simulation.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">7</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.7">Measuring Time</head><p>One step of the algorithm (Section 2.1.3) can be interpreted as a collision of two (or more) molecules. Simulated time is proportional to the number of collisions divided by reactor size M . It is common to measure the simulated time in generations, where one generation consists of M collisions, independent of whether a collision causes a reaction or not. Using M collisions (a generation) as a unit of time is appropriate because otherwise an increase of the reactor size M would result in a slowdown of developmen t speed. If, for example, 10 10 collisions were computed in a reactor with a population size of 10 5 , this would mean that, statistically, every molecule of the population participated twice in a reaction. If the same number of collisions were computed in a reactor of size 10 20 , only half the molecules would have taken part in a reaction. This would result in a fourfold slower development, if time were not scaled by reactor size.</p><p>In continuously modeled ACs the progress of time depends on the integration step size of the numerical ODE solver. For a standard solver, a xed step length of h D 10 ¡2 is a common setting. Thus, 100 evaluations of the ODE are needed to get a unit length of time progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.8">Pattern Matching</head><p>Pattern matching is a method widely used in arti cial chemistries and other arti cial life systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">112]</ref>. A pattern can be regarded as information about (or as a means to identify) the semantics of a subcomponent or location. It allows one to refer to parts of a system in an associative way independent from the absolute position of these parts. Koza, for example, used the shape of trees to address subtrees and to select reaction partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. In the eld of DNA computing, pattern matching is a central mechanism in the alignment of two DNA strands. There, a pattern is a sequence of nucleotides such as CGATTGAGGGA. . . In Tierra, a pattern is given by a sequence of NOP0 and NOP1 operations in the genome of an individual and is used to direct jumps <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> of the program counter. McCaskill <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref> suggested modeling a chemical polymer system as molecules interacting inside a pattern space instead of modeling the movement inside a reaction vessel.</p><p>The accuracy of a match can be used to calculate the probability of a reaction or rate constants, as suggested in Bagley and Farmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In order to compute the accuracy, a distance measure between patterns is needed that computes the "similarity" of two molecules by assigning a numerical value. A convenient distance measure for variablelength sequences is the string edit distance. The distance between strings of the same length is usually computed by the Hamming distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.9">Spatial Topology</head><p>A spatial structure of the reactor is a parameter of the algorithm A of the AC fS, R, Ag and has no further in uence on S and R except for some approaches that allow molecules to grow and occupy more than one point in the reactor space (see Section 3.7 for a description of such ACs). In most cases, the reactor is modeled as a well stirred tank reactor, often with a continuous in ow and out ow of substances. In a well stirred tank reactor the probability that a molecule s i will participate in a reaction r is independent of its position in the reactor. In a reactor with topology, the probability depends on the neighborhood of s i . This neighborhood may be determined by the vicinity of s i in a Euclidian space. This space may be two-or more-dimensional. Also, the neighborhood may be de ned as the neighborhood in a cellular automaton (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">136]</ref>) or as a self-organizing associative space <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>All these different spatial structures have one thing in common: They have a more or less important in uence on the selection of reactants, performed by the algorithm A. By adopting an additional spatial structure, the analysis of ACs becomes a more complicated task; but on the other hand, some of the observed properties might not occur without it.</p></div>

A rule de nes whether a pattern of symbols can be replaced by another pattern. There are two variants for utilizing rewriting systems to de ne the reactions. On the one hand, the application of a rule corresponds to a reaction (see Sections 3.1.1-3.1.3); on the other hand, one single reaction consists of multiple applications of many rules (see <ref type="bibr">Section 3.1.4 and [122]</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">The Chemical Abstract Machine (CHAM)</head><p>Berry and Boudol have developed an abstract machine, called the chemical abstract machine (CHAM), which is based on the chemical information processing metaphor, to model concurrent computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The machine is an extension of the C language introduced by Benâtre and Le Métayer <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p><p>Molecules: The molecules s 1 , s 2 , . . . are terms of an algebra. The reactor (population, solution) is a nite multiset, which may contain molecules as well as subpopulations called subsolutions. Subpopulations are treated like molecules. Reactions may take place in subpopulations independently and in parallel. A membrane concept enables molecules to leave subpopulations.</p><p>Reactions: A special CHAM is de ned by a set of transformation laws. There are four general laws that are valid for every CHAM and are the only rules that contain premises. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">8</ref> The speci c rules de ne a special CHAM and are simple rewriting rules of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s k ¡! s 0 1 , s 0 2 , . . . s 0 l (6)</formula><p>The general laws de ne how these rewriting rules can be applied to a multiset. Roughly speaking, they say that molecules inside a (sub)population that matches the left side may be replaced by the molecules on the right side (reaction and chemical law), that a subpopulation may develop independently (membrane law), and that molecules may enter or leave a subpopulation (airlock law).</p><p>To de ne a special CHAM, an arbitrary set of special rules of the form ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) can be added to the general laws. To ease handling of the special rules, Berry and Boudol <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> distinguish three classes of special rules, namely, heating rules, cooling rules, and reaction rules. A heating rule decomposes a molecule into its components. A cooling rule is the corresponding counterpart. Heating and cooling are considered to be reversible. Reaction rules are irreversible and are usually applied to heated molecules. They change the information content of a population.</p><p>Dynamics: At any time a CHAM may perform an arbitrary number of transformations in parallel, provided that no molecule is used more than once to match the left side of a reaction law. A CHAM is nondeterministic if more than one transformation rule may be applied to the population at a time. In this case the CHAM selects a transformation rule randomly. (This selection process is guided by an objective function in the chemical casting model by Kanada and Hirokawa <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> (see Section 3.1.3).)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">The Chemical Rewriting System on Multisets (ARMS)</head><p>The chemical abstract machine has been developed to model concurrent computing. However, Suzuki and Tanaka demonstrate that it can be utilized to model chemical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">126]</ref>.

It is used to analyze the in uence of the order of rule application on the dynamics. Different rate constants are modeled by different frequencies of rule application.</p><p>It has been shown that ARMS is able to model oscillating chemical systems, such as the Brusselator. Suzuki and Tanaka investigated the qualitative dynamics of ARMS by generating rewriting rules randomly and they derived criteria for the emergence of cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>. They also de ned an order parameter l e , which is roughly the relation of the number of heating rules to the number of cooling rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>. They found that for small and for large l e values the dynamics are simple: The rewriting system terminates and no cycles appear. For intermediate l e values cycles emerge. Recently ARMS has been applied to model ecological systems (see Section 4.1.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">The Chemical Casting Model (CCM)</head><p>The chemical casting model (CCM) introduced by Kanada is also a production system inspired by the chemical metaphor. The motivation was to develop a new method for optimization of constraint satisfaction problems. In addition, the CCM can be regarded as a model for emergent computation.</p><p>Molecules: Molecules (composed of atoms) and reaction rules depend on the type of the search problem. In general, atoms are components of a potential solution of the problem. In Kanada's and Kanada and Hirokawa's examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref> the whole population (working memory) represents one point in search space. Each atom has a type and a state. Atoms can be connected by links. Links may be used to specify a concrete problem, like in the graph coloring example. In this case links are xed during a simulation. For a traveling salesman problem (TSP), links can represent a solution to the problem and thus have to change during the search process.</p><p>Reactions: The reaction rules have in general the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">LHS ¡! RHS (7)</formula><p>where the left-hand side (LHS) is a sequence of patterns. If a subset of atoms matches the LHS it may be replaced by atoms that match the right-hand side (RHS).</p><p>Dynamics: The quality of a solution is measured by a local evaluation function called the local order degree (LOD). The LOD is used to decide whether a rule can be applied or not. There are two types of LODs: The rst one maps one atom to a number and the second one maps two atoms to a number. A rule may be applied if the sum of the LODs of the participating atoms on the left-hand side is smaller than the sum of the LODs on the right-hand side. The quality of the solution is only measured locally by this method.</p><p>Kanada has also introduced an annealing method by assigning an additional energy state variable, called frustration, to each atom <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. The frustration is similar to a kinetic energy. The frustration is added to the LOD so that, if the frustration of atoms is high, they may react even if the previous LOD criteria are not ful lled. In case of an elastic collision, the frustration of the colliding atoms is increased by a factor c. In case of a reaction, the frustration is reset to an initial value.</p><p>Kanada and Hirokawa <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> have demonstrated successfully the application of the CCM to different constraint satisfaction problems, namely, graph coloring, the N-queens problem, and TSP. The simulations show that even if during the simulation the current solution is evaluated only locally, the system can converge to the global optimum. They have also shown how the locality of the reaction rules can be tuned by adding a catalyst. Adding a catalyst reduces the locality of a rule, which roughly leads to faster convergence speed, but increases the probability that the system will get stuck in a local optimum. The advantage of this approach is that many processors may operate on one instance of a problem solution in parallel with minimal communication because every evaluation of the quality and every variation is performed locally. In some cases (like graph coloring) even synchronization and access con ict to a shared memory can be ignored, because they only generate a harmless noise of low intensity. A problem is the termination criterion. In general it is a global operation to determine whether the optimum is found (if possible). A local termination criterion would have to estimate the global quality, which results in a longer computation time.</p></div>

In their experiments typically a simulation was used with explicit molecules and explicit single collisions according to the algorithm in Section 2.2.1, and a constant reactor size (M D 1000-3000). The reactor is initialized with random molecules.</p><p>With the simple reaction scheme and algorithm of the rst example (Section 2) Fontana observed that the diversity of the population reduced quickly, often leading to only one surviving self-replicating species. The organization structure of the surviving ensembles is called level-0 organization. In general, a level-0 organization consists of a few closely coupled replicators.</p><p>In order to arrive at more complex reaction networks, Fontana introduced additional lter conditions. For instance, a collision was considered to be elastic if the outcome of the reaction function was equal to one of the reactants. In such a case an exact replication was not allowed. The result of these additional lter conditions were reaction networks called level-1 organizations composed of a huge, even in nite, number of molecules. These organizations were very stable. Because the reactor size was small compared to the size of a level-1 organization, a level-1 organization was only represented by some of its species in the reactor and constantly produced new species (with respect to the species in the reactor). A randomly generated species inserted into a reactor containing a level-1 organization would only rarely be incorporated into the organization. If it was incorporated the new organization was typically extended in layers.</p><p>Fontana further de ned level-2 organizations, which consist of two (or more) coexisting level-1 organizations. The stable coexistence is characterized by the following two conditions: (a) The organizations interact. (b) The interaction is moderated by intermediate species called glue. A spontaneous emergence of a level-2 organization from a randomly initialized population is extremely rare. However, it can be synthetically generated by merging two independently evolved level-1 organizations.</p><p>Fontana discovered that the species dominating the reactor after the transient phase have a similar syntactical structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. This phenomenon is typical for constructive arti cial chemistry and appears even in systems with totally different representation and reaction mechanisms.

A sequence of such modi cations has been identi ed as an evolutionary process. The spontaneous uctuations are explicitly induced by the metdynamical algorithm, which can be interpreted as explicit (passive) mutation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Abstract Automata</head><p>The concept of an abstract automaton or machine is commonly used in computer science and provides a variety of approaches to de ne structure-function relationships. Interesting candidates are nite state machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> or Turing machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">134]</ref>, which operate on binary data. So, it is quite natural to represent molecules as collections of bits organized as binary strings. The state transition function of the machines can be represented as a lookup table or by a program (a sequence of commands). A molecule appears in two forms: (a) as passive data (binary string) and (b ) as an active machine. The mapping from a binary string into its machine form is called folding. Folding may be indeterministic and may depend on other molecules (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Arti cial Molecular Machines</head><p>Already in the early 1970s Laing argued for using abstract, nonanalogous models in order to develop a general theory for living systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. For developing such a general theory so-called arti cial organisms would be required. Laing suggested a series of arti cial organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> that should allow one to study general properties of life and thus to derive a theory that is not restricted to the instances of life we observe on earth. The arti cial organisms consist of different compartments, for example, a "brain" plus "body" parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. These compartments contain molecules from an arti cial chemistry.</p><p>Molecules: The molecules are strings of symbols, usually binary strings. Molecules can appear in two forms: They can be binary data strings or machines. In machine form the molecules are represented as a sequence of instructions where the sequence possesses a three-dimensional shape. So, the machine form is a molecule that contains loops. The motivation behind this design is to avoid jumps that are biologically implausible according to Laing <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>.</p><p>Reactions: In order to perform a reaction, two molecules are attached to each other so that they touch at one position (atom). One of the molecules is considered to be the active machine, which is able to manipulate the passive data molecule. For running the machine the instruction at the binding position is executed. Depending on the content of data and machine molecules at the binding position, the binding position is moved to the left or the right on the data molecule. On the machine molecule, the binding position moves also, which is equivalent to pointing to the next instruction.</p><p>Dynamics: Laing has not considered an explicit dynamics, probably because a dynamical simulation of his arti cial chemistries was beyond the computational means available back then. However, he proved that his arti cial organisms are able to perform universal computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> and he also demonstrated different forms of selfreproduction, self-description, and self-inspection <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Polymers as Turing Machines</head><p>McCaskill investigated the self-organization of the genetic apparatus by a model reactive polymer chemistry implemented in silicon. Starting from an implementation as software <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, he realized the AC in a specially designed parallel computer <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">132]</ref>. The early work by McCaskill should be described in more detail.</p><p>Molecules: Linear macromolecular heteropolymers provide a simple class of molecules with combinatorial complexity. Polymers consisting of nite sequences of bases from a nite set of monomers (restricted to two) with a bounded length l act as the set S . In earlier experiments, l was typically 20. In later experiments with special parallel hardware, the length was not limited any more. Each molecular string can be processed as a linear molecule and also codes for an automaton. This is a well known property of universal Turing machines, which also divide the tape into program and data.</p><p>Reactions: Binding dynamics is integrated ef ciently using a pattern matching collision table. This results in a molecular pattern-based interaction where the relationship between function (here it is replication) and sequence is externally speci ed. Only bimolecular or unimolecular reactions occur, with all unimolecular rates set to zero or to one. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">10</ref> To encode the relationship between sequences, the two-body-interaction scheme uses patterns f0, 1, #g ¤ (# is a "don't care" symbol). The number of #s in the condition (pattern) determines the speci city of the recognition. Strings of length l encode 2 m C1 ¡ 1 different patterns of length up to m D 1, 2, . . . , l . Only rules for the derivation of kinetic parameters from macromolecular sequences are given: The bimolecular rates thus depend on concentration and speci city. The general reaction scheme can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">s 1 C s 2 ¡! s 1 C s 3 , if p 1 µ s 1 matches p 2 µ s 2 . (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">)</formula><p>In this reaction, p 1 and p 2 are substrings (patterns) of the polymers, p 1 is the processor, and p 2 acts as the data.</p><p>Dynamics: The reactor realizes a two-dimensional domain (in the early experiments a linear domain) in which the polymers are set to random locations. In the latter case, the neighborhood is de ned by a relationship in "pattern-space," in the former case, the neighborhood is de ned by the location in the Euclidian space of the reactor.</p><p>In later work <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">132]</ref> ACs were implemented and simulated with recon gurable hardware based on FPGAs. The algorithm realizes a "pattern processing chemistry" and this processing is potentially universal: It is a probabilistic and constructive variant of a Turing machine operating on a polymer tape. A special error rate parameter controls the precision of elementary steps of the Turing machine. Without this parameter, the dynamics would reduce to a Markovian dynamics: The population of sequences at time t would determine the future dynamics. This error rate can be regarded as "mutation." The real encoding of processors from crossed molecular strings is a modi cation of a Turing machine: It has two tapes and no nite state machine. The point of intersection moves, with symbols under the point of intersection being directly modi ed, and the direction of future motion is determined by the two symbols. The tapes of the Turing machine are built with two randomly chosen polymers, with the rst string acting as processor and the second string acting as data. The resulting two strings are returned to the population.</p><p>It is observed that during the development of the system, strings with the ability to self-replicate appear. In coevolution with parasites, an evolutionary arms race started among these species and the self-replicating string diversi ed to such an extent that the parasites could not coadapt and went extinct. In the lattice environment, sets of cooperating polymers evolved, interacting in a hypercyclic fashion. In the latest experiments, a Chemoton-like cooperative behavior appeared, with spatially isolated, membrane-bounded evolutionary stable molecular organizations. These organizations were capable of self-assembling their surrounding membrane and, as a whole, were "diffused" in space. Spatial isolation allows diversi cation into separate competing species (each representing open reaction networks). Cooperative organizations show an evolutionary advantage over more "egoistic" organizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Machine-Tape Interaction</head><p>Ikegami and Hashimoto developed an abstract arti cial chemistry based on binary strings where the interaction is de ned by a Turing machine with nite circular tape.</p><p>Molecules: There are two molecular types: tapes and machines. Tapes are circular binary strings (7 bits long in Ikegami and Hashimoto <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>). Machines are binary strings composed of a head (4 bits), a tail (4 bits), and a state transition lookup table (8 bits). Tapes and machines form two separate populations in the reactor.</p><p>Reactions: Reactions take place between a tape and a machine according to the following reaction scheme:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">s M C s T ¡! s M C s T C s 0 M C s 0 T (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>A machine s M is allowed to react with a tape if its head matches a substring of the tape s T and its tail matches a different substring of the tape s T . The machine operates only between these two substrings (called reading frame), which results in a tape s 0 T . The tape s 0 T is folded (translated <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>) into a machine s 0 M by reading 16 bits in a circular way starting at the head binding position. Thus, a tape s 0 T can be translated into different machines if there are machines that bind to different positions at tape s T .</p><p>Dynamics: The molecules are represented implicitly by an integer frequency vector. During the simulation the population sizes of machines and tapes are kept constant, as in Dittrich and Banzhaf <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and Fontana and Buss <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. An update is performed by replacing a fraction of c (in Ikegami and Hashimoto <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> c D 60%) molecules of the reactor by reaction products. The composition of the reaction products is calculated using rate equations with real valued variables and parameters. For this, the integer frequency vector is converted into a real valued concentration vector, and the result of the rate equations is rounded to obtain integer values.</p><p>Ikagami and Hashimoto showed that under the in uence of low noise, simple autocatalytic loops are formed. When the noise level is increased, the reaction network is destabilized by parasites, but after a relatively long transient phase (about 1000 generations) a very stable, dense reaction network, called a core network <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, is formed. A core network maintains its relatively high diversity even if the noise is deactivated. The active mutation rate is high. When the noise level is very high, only small, degenerated core networks emerge with a low diversity and very low (or even no) active mutation.</p><p>At a low noise level, reaction cycles are formed that are similar to the hypercyclic organizations proposed by Eigen and Schuster <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Ikegami and Hashimoto called them Eigen/Schuster type networks, which have the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">s M C s T ¡! s M C s T C s 0 M C s T s 0 M C s 0 T ¡! s 0 M C s 0 T C s M C s 0 T (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">)</formula><p>A reaction network like Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_31">19</ref>does not perform any active mutation. At a higher noise level, a different type of reaction cycle emerged, called a double autocatalytic network <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. These cycles maintain a high active mutation and in their pure form do not perform exact replication. The following network is an example of a double loop type network:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">s M C s T ¡! s M C s T C s 0 M C s 0 T s 0 M C s 0 T ¡! s 0 M C s 0 T C s M C s T (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>The core networks that emerged under the in uence of external noise are very stable, so that there is no further developmen t after they have appeared. To promote evolution, reaction systems can be encapsulated into cells (compartments) where substances are allowed to diffuse. Ikegami and Hashimoto showed that this can result in complex, coevolutive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.3">Automata Reaction</head><p>The automata reaction, developed by us <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, is based on a formal nite state automaton, which is a mixture of a Turing machine and a command-driven register machine. It has been inspired by Typogenetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. The automata reaction has been designed in consideration of "respecting the medium" <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, here a von Neumann computer, so that it is fast and ef cient, which allows large population sizes (e.g., 10 6 ) and long simulations (e.g., 10,000 generations).</p><p>Molecules: The molecules are xed-length binary strings S D f0, 1g 32 . This allows easy and ef cient explicit simulations.</p><p>Reactions: An interaction of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">s 1 C s 2 ¡! s 1 C s 2 C s 3<label>(21)</label></formula><p>among two strings s 1 , s 2 2 S is performed in two steps: (a) s 1 is mapped to a nite state automaton A s 1 by interpreting s 1 as 4-bit machine code. (b) The automaton A s 1 is applied to s 2 to generate the output s 3 . Note that after the reaction the automaton is discarded and s 1 is not changed. Each sequence may act as an automaton and/or be processed as an automaton with equal probability. There is no population of automata like those in the system by Ikegami and Hashimoto. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows the structure of the automaton. It contains two 32-bit registers, the I/O register and the operator register. At the beginning, operator string s 1 is written into the operator register and operand s 2 into the I/O register. The program is generated from s 1 by simply mapping successive 4-bit segments into instructions. The resulting program is executed sequentially, starting with the rst instruction. The automaton halts after the last instruction has been executed. During program execution the automaton can only modify bits in the I/O register, but can read bits from the operator register. There are logic and arithmetic operations that take as input two bits, one from the I/O and one from the operator register, respectively. The result is stored in the I/O register.</p><p>The position of processed bits is under the control of the program. In addition, in some experiments elastic collisions are introduced by not allowing exact replications <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>Dynamics: With the automata reaction, several experiments have been performed using explicit single-molecule collisions and explicit populations with and without a topological structure. Typical phenomena that have been observed are: dominance of self-replicators, the formation of catalytic networks, complexity increase when exact replication is disallowed, and syntactic similarity of molecules forming the emergent organizations. These observations support the ndings of Fontana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, especially the phenomenon of syntactic and semantic closure. In large systems of this AC, evolutionary phenomena have been observed. This is notable because no explicit variation (passive mutation) and no explicit tness function is present in the system. Variation and "natural" selection are driven by the molecules themselves. For this reason the phenomenon has been termed self-evolution. Further phenomena observed are spontaneous emergence of recombination and spontaneous transition from lazy to eager replicators.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">11</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Assembler Automata</head><p>An assembler automaton <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">12</ref> is a parallel computational machine that consists of a core memory and parallel processing units. It can be regarded as a parallel von Neumann machine. Assembler automata have been used to create certain arti cial life systems. In this section we will describe the basic functionality of assembler automata and discuss their relation to arti cial chemistries.</p><p>The rst implemented assembler automaton of competing computer programs is Core War. Core War was designed by Dewdney as a game where handwritten computer programs struggle for computer resources and may ght each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The system is in fact a multi-processor, shared-memory system. All processors operate on the same linear and cyclic memory called core. The machine code (called redcode) consists of only 10 instructions with one or two arguments. Memory cells can be addressed only direct relative or indirect relative. Thus, the execution of a program is independent from its absolute position in the memory.</p><p>For a typical match, two programs that should play against each other are stored at random locations in the core memory. Then they are started in parallel by assigning each program a CPU with its own program counter (PC) and registers. The following example illustrates the redcode language. It is a program writing a zero at every fth memory location, which should overwrite and destroy the code of its opponent. The simplest self-replicating program consists of only one instruction: MOV 0 1. This instruction copies the contents of the relative address 0 (the MOV 0 1 instruction) to the next memory cell (relative address 1). Thus, the program scrolls through the memory leaving a track of MOV 1 0 instructions behind. There is also an instruction to split execution, which creates a new process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.1">Coreworld</head><p>Rasmussen et al. have used Core Wars to build an arti cial chemistry called Coreworld <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">108]</ref>. They introduced random uctuations in two different ways: (a) New processes are started at random with randomly initialized PCs. (b) When a MOV instruction is executed, the copied data may be mutated. In addition, computational resources are introduced explicitly. Each cell holds an amount of computational resources (a number), which are used up by program execution and are re lled by a constant in ux. There is also a maximum operation radius, which restricts relative addressing and promotes locality.</p><p>Rasmussen et al. observed through various experiments that the qualitative dynamic behavior depends crucially on the parameter setting. For low resource in ux (called desert condition) only simple cyclic structures dominated the converged population. For high resource in ux (called jungle condition) diversity becomes much richer and more complex, even cooperating structures emerge.</p><p>Molecules: A problem in Coreworld is to identify a molecule or organism which might be de ned as a collection of cells or instructions. The smaller an individual is, the harder it is to distinguish it from the environment. In addition, situations are dif cult where instruction pointers are intermingled. Ray has overcome this problem by introducing a memory management in Tierra.</p><p>Reactions: The Coreworld chemistry is different from other ACs because there are no explicitly de ned reactions between molecules. Due to the fact that it is dif cult to identify molecules, interactions between molecules are even more dif cult to determine. Implicitly, a reaction might be seen as the execution of code belonging to another molecule.</p><p>Dynamics: The dynamics of the system is achieved by many CPUs working in parallel on different pieces of code. The code moves within the memory and changes because of explicit mutations or changes caused by other programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2">Tierra</head><p>Ray has designed Tierra to model the origin of the diversity of life (e.g., the Cambrian explosion), not its origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. Tierra is similar to Core War with the following important modi cations and extensions:</p><p>Small instruction set without numeric operands: The instruction set of Tierra consists of 32 instructions. Thus, only 5 bits are needed per cell. Therefore memory cells in Tierra are much smaller than in Core War, where in addition to the opcode of the instruction the arguments have to be stored.</p><p>Addressing by templates: Memory locations are addressed by templates, which consist of NOP0 and NOP1 instructions. Consider, for example, the following program sequence consisting of four instructions: JMP NOP0 NOP1 NOP0. The target for the jump instruction is the closest of the inverse patterns formed by the three instructions NOP1 NOP0 NOP1.</p><p>Memory allocation and protection: Programs can allocate memory, which is protected by a global memory manager. Other programs are not allowed to write protected memory, but may read or execute it. By this method it is much easier to specify and make clear which memory cells belong to a certain organism.</p><p>Arti cial tness pressure: Ray also introduced an arti cial, explicit tness pressure by penalizing "illegal" or unwanted operations; like a JMP instruction where no target pattern can be found or division by zero. Programs executing many unwanted operations are more likely to be terminated by a reaper process, which is invoked when the allocated memory exceeds a prede ned threshold. This mechanism allows one also to create a tness pressure towards more ef cient organisms, easily.</p><p>Molecules, reactions, and dynamics: These are nearly the same as in Coreworld, except for the "molecules," which are easier to determine because they possess a clearly separated and protected piece of memory. In typical experiments with Tierra, the core memory is initialized with a handwritten program, the ancestor, which is able to selfreplicate. Under the in uence of mutations and random uctuations the population diversi es. Ray has observed the evolution of parasites, protection against parasitism, hyper-parasites, and cooperative organization. It should be noted that the different species are similar to the ancestor and are often generated from it by only a few point mutations.</p><p>It has been experimentally shown that in Tierra self-replicating entities, like the ancestor, do not appear spontaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. Pargellis has shown that this can be achieved by simplifying the instruction set so that the probability of getting a selfreplicating program randomly is increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103]</ref> (see also Primordial Soup by M.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.3">Avida</head><p>Ray's Tierra was further developed by Adami's Avida group. The major differences between Tierra and Avida are the restriction to only local interaction between individuals, and the maximum population size given by the dimensions of the grid rather than by the size of the total genome space of the population.</p><p>Molecules: A molecule is a single assembler program. The assembler language is a reduced variant of Tierra's instruction set. Initial molecules are usually handwritten self-replicating programs.</p><p>Reactions: In the fundamental Avida system, the only unimolecular rst-order reactions that occur are of replicator type.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Lattice Molecular Systems</head><p>In this section, we discuss systems that consist of a regular lattice where each lattice site can hold a part (e.g., atom) of a molecule. Bonds can be formed between parts so that a molecule covers many lattice sites. This is different from systems where a lattice site holds a complete molecule, like in Avida or Banzhaf et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The important difference is that in lattice molecular systems the space of the molecular structure is identical with the space in which the molecules are oating around.

The system consists of a 2D squared lattice.</p><p>Molecules: Each lattice site can be occupied by one of the following atoms: Substrate S, catalyst K , and monomer L (also called link particle <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>).

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> illustrates an autopoietic entity, which may arise in such an arti cial chemistry.</p><p>This autopoietic entity has a cell-like structure. Its membrane is formed by a chain of L monomers and encloses one or more catalysts K . Only substrate S may diffuse through the membrane. Substrate inside is catalyzed by K to form free monomers. If the membrane is damaged by disintegration of a monomer L, it can be quickly repaired by a free monomer oating around inside the cell.</p><p>A problem arises when monomers inside the cell form bonds among each other. In this case it is unlikely that the cell is able to self-repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. Thus, a mechanism has to prevent the formation of bonds inside the cell. Here, this is achieved by chain-based bond inhibition, which has already been used but not documented in the original work by Varela et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref> and reconsidered by McMullin and Varela <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>.</p><p>They demonstrate by simulation that without chain-based bond inhibition, self-repair is unlikely, otherwise likely. But the simulation also showed that even with chain-based bond inhibition, the autopoietic entity is not asymptotically stable. In all reported 5 runs the autopoietic structure was able to sustain itself for only about 200-1500 update cycles. There have been no systematic parameter studies performed, yet. So it cannot be said whether the observed phenomena are typical and which necessary properties an arti cial chemistry must have in order to allow persistent autopoietic structures.</p></div>

Atoms in a polymer are connected with a bond.</p><p>Reactions: Due to the fact that neither new bonds are created nor old bonds deleted, there are no reactions taking place. There still is interaction between molecules on the level of forces, spatial movement, and several kinds of energy.</p><p>Dynamics: The synchronous and deterministic update rules of the cellular automaton cause the dynamics of the system. An interesting feature of the LMA is that forces are modeled by force particles, which are propagated during one update cycle to the temporary variables of neighboring lattice sites. To illustrate the mechanism the update cycle will be brie y summarized. It consists of 18 substeps, which are organized in the following six steps:</p><p>Step 1: Propagation of molecular types and kinetic energy: Thermal diffusion is performed by redistributing kinetic energy to neighbors.</p><p>Step 2: Construction of force elds: Outgoing force particles are copied into the corresponding temporary ingoing force particle variables. They may be modulated depending on the molecular type.</p><p>Step 3: Calculation of potential energies: The calculation of the potential energies is based on a Coulomb term, where ingoing force particles are multiplied with corresponding outgoing force particles. A rotation to the right or left takes place if the local potential energy is reduced by this rotation. This step also handles induced charge displacement (dipole/induced dipole interaction), polarization (induced dipole/induced dipole interaction), and cooperative increasing strength of bonds. After step 3 the sum of forces affecting a molecular object are calculated for all directions.</p><p>Step 4: Calculation of move direction: The move direction is calculated based on classical mechanics by taking the current kinetic energy ("speed") and the nal potential energy of step 3 ("forces") into account. If the lattice site in this direction is already occupied by a molecular object, the object remains at its current location.</p><p>To avoid bond-breaking, a movement is performed only if the molecular object does not leave the neighborhood of any of its neighbors it is connected to. This will signi cantly reduce the movement.</p><p>Step 5: Update of bonds in polymers: Bonds inside polymers are moved according to the molecular movement in step 4. No new bonds are created or removed.</p><p>Step 6: Movement of molecules: The nontemporary values of the molecular molecules are copied to neighboring cells according to their previously calculated move directions.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref> the LMA is demonstrated by simulating (a) cluster formation of polar molecules, (b) phase separation of a mixture of water molecules and hydrophobic monomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>, (c) polymers in a simulating polymer dynamics in a polar environment (e.g., water) <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref>, and (d ) emergence of self-reproducing micelle-lik e structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>.

It should also be noted that these micelles reproduce. A hydrophobic surface of a micelle is able to catalyze hydrophobic polymers to become amphiphilic, which are afterwards incorporated into the micelle.

This allows one to build a model for the yield of the desired target structure by means of chemical kinetics theory. In Hosokawa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> this approach is demonstrated by deriving an analytical model for a simple mechanical self-assembling system, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.2">The Chemical Metaphor in Cellular Automata</head><p>In Section 3.7 we have already seen that cellular automata can be used as a medium to simulate polymer chemistries. In this section we are going to discuss two more abstract models. They are more abstract in the sense that the de nition of a molecule or reaction is implicit and depends on an observer or on an interpretation. In the lattice molecular systems described above it is clear what a molecule or a reaction is, because they are part of the model description. In the following approaches the model speci cation does not contain any notion of a molecule or reaction. They emerge as structures that are interpreted as chemical units. Self-Replicating Loops In cellular automata self-replicating patterns can appear. A famous example is the original work by von Neumann, who de ned a complex CA in order to demonstrate that self-replication is possible inside machines. In subsequent work by others simpler and more elegant cellular automata have been developed displaying self-replicating patterns, like Langton's self-reproducing loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. A cellular automaton like this can be interpreted as an arti cial chemistry where the molecules are the self-replicating structures. This becomes noticeable in the work by Sayama <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>, for example, who introduces structural dissolution in Langton's self-reproducing loop. In this work the loops begin to dissolve after replication (Plate 3). Thus, they have to permanently keep reproducing in order to keep the number of loops at a certain concentration level. Sayama also showed that in a bounded nite space, competition occurs, which leads to evolutionary effects. Furthermore, interaction among loops takes place, which can be interpreted as a chemical reaction. Embedded Particles in Cellular Automata as Molecules A different way to relate CAs to chemistry is to interpret a moving boundary between two homogeneous domains in a CA as a molecule <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref> shows an example of a one-dimensional CA. The gure shows the trace of the state-transition where two "particles" collide. The major difference from the previous approach is that particles become visible as space-time structures and that they are de ned as boundaries and not as a connected set of cells with speci c states. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.3">Typogenetics</head><p>Typogenetics was introduced in 1979 by Hofstadter in order to illustrate the "formal logic of life" <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. It can be regarded as one of the rst arti cial chemistries and has been further investigated by Morris, Varetto, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138]</ref>. The molecules of the system are character sequences (called strands) over the alphabet A, C, G, T. The reaction rules are "typographic" manipulations based on a set of prede ned basic operations such as cutting, insertion, or deletion of characters. A sequence of such operations form a unit (called an enzyme), which may operate on a character sequence like a Turing machine on its tape (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref>).</p><p>A strand codes for several enzymes, which are separated by the "duplet" AA. To translate a character sequence into a sequence of operations, a pair of two characters codes for one operation. For example AC codes for "cut," which cuts a strand at the current binding position of the enzyme (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref> ). The initial binding position of an enzyme depends in a nontrivial way on its coding sequence. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref> the rst enzyme binds initially to G. If the strand contains more than one character of this kind, one will be randomly chosen.</p><p>Double-stranded molecules can be formed, too. There are two operations which create double-stranded molecules: "copy mode on" and "copy mode off." If the copy mode is active, movement of the enzyme creates an inverse copy of characters it is touching. The enzyme may also switch from one strand to its parallel strand by a "switch" operation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref>). Typogenetics is very complex because the size of molecules is variable, a reaction may produce a variable number of products, and the reaction mechanism is non-deterministic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Applications</head><p>As has been argued above, the applications of arti cial chemistries can be subdivided into three domains: (a) modeling, (b ) information processing, and (c) optimization. By "application" we refer not only to industrial applications, but also to applications where the chemical metaphor is used to build a model of a system in order to extend knowledge about our environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Modeling</head><p>Most AC work falls into the domain of modeling. Within this domain mainly biochemical systems are modeled. Exceptions are, for instance, the chemical abstract machine (CHAM), which models concurrent computer processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (Section 3.1.1) or the Random Prolog Processor applied to model social systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">130]</ref>.</p><p>The chemical metaphor can also serve to model higher structures such as population dynamics, ecological systems, social systems, or economic markets. The similarity of these systems and their relation to the chemical metaphor becomes particularly clear in the replicator equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">133]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_39">d x i d t D x i ( f i (x 1 , . . . , x n ) ¡ W(x 1 , . . . , x n ))<label>(23)</label></formula><p>which describes the dynamics of n replicating types. The function f i can be interpreted as the catalytic in uence of all other types on the replication rate of x i or as the tness of type i, which may depend on the concentration of all other types. The dilution ux W is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">W(x 1 , . . . , x n ) D n X iD1 x i f i (x 1 , . . . , x n )<label>(24)</label></formula><p>and can also be interpreted as the average tness ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, p. 67). The dilution ux ensures that the state of the system stays inside the concentration simplex S n . On the molecular level the replicator equation is applied to model ensembles of replicating molecules (e.g., polymers). In this category falls the hypercycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, whose dynamics can be described by a special form of the replicator equation. On an ecological scale the replicator equation describes the dynamics of interacting populations. In this case replication rate constants can be associated with tness values of certain groups or species. The replicator equation is equivalent to the Lotka-Voltera equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, which demonstrates the close relation between chemical and ecological dynamics. Even for social and economic systems the replicator equation can serve as a model <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</p></div>

These are the approaches to which the term "arti cial" refers. Strictly speaking we should have these abstract models of chemistry in mind when using the term "arti cial chemistry" in a modeling context. If we encompassed all kinds of chemical models, the term "arti cial chemistry" would lose some substance. Of course, the boundary line is fuzzy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Evolution and Self-assembly</head><p>Two important ways to generate biochemical complexity are (a) self-assembly and (b) evolution. We can use these two aspects as another way to distinguish between different AC approaches.</p><p>Self-assembly produces a more complicated structure by local interaction of independent entities without central control. Typical examples of self-assembly are the formation of micelles or the morphogenesis of phages. It is believed that the transition from a non-self-maintaining population of molecules to a self-maintaining population, which later developed into a population of aggregates that we would call living, has occurred through a process of chemical evolution and self-assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Self-assembly plays an important role not only in the origin of living systems, but also in their operation today. Furthermore, self-assembly can be employed as a strategy to build nano-scale structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>, such as thin lms or molecular wires, or to solve computational problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>.</p><p>When self-assembly is simulated we have to include a model of a (physical) space wherein the entities are located. It is typical for such simulation models that the space of interaction is the same as the space of movement. Thus, we cannot easily (or naturally) obtain a model in terms of the (S, R , A) scheme by separating the reaction rules R from the algorithm A that describes the reaction space. Furthermore, interactions may depend on the movement (e.g., velocity) or relative orientation of the interacting entities in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>.</p><p>There is a large body of work in the domain of computational chemistry that uses Monte Carlo methods in order to simulate self-assembly processes accurately (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dawnkaski et al. [39]</ref>). These approaches aim at realistic models for direct comparison of simulation results with experimental real-world data. On the other hand, arti cial chemistry approaches do not emphasize comparability on the microscopic level; rather they aim at revealing the "logic" of certain phenomena, such as the emergence of dynamical hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>, the formation of micelles <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118]</ref> or autopoietic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">136]</ref>, or the spontaneous formation of aggregates that undergo division and evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref> (Section 3.7). It might be added that physical models are also nicely suited to investigate self-assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref> (Section 3.8.1 ).</p><p>The AC literature on evolution is much larger than that on self-assembly (see Section 3).

The objective of these models is to investigate the conditions under which an evolutionary process comparable to that observed in nature occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Species formation is one of the investigated phenomena, for example, the development of diverse quasi species <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. The aim of EVOLVE IV is (a) to generate a niche structure reminiscent of the niche structure of a natural ecosystem and (b ) to investigate the conditions under which niche diversi cation can occur. Brewster and Conrad <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> describe experiments where the population is initialized with handwritten organisms. They consist of 22 essential genes (e.g., sugar decomposition) and one nonessential gene (conjugation gene). There are two complementary genes (photosynthesis and scavenging gene) so that the population may diversify by specializing on one of these genes. At least one of these two genes is required for survival. In simulations most organisms carried both genes (if initially supplied with both) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, p. 480 ). AC as an Ecological Model Suzuki, Takabayashi, and Tanaka <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> applied the abstract chemical rewriting system (ARMS) to model an ecological system in which plants respond to herbivore feeding activity by producing volatiles that in turn attract carnivorous natural enemies of the herbivores. Such defense mechanisms have been reported in several tritrophic systems. The volatiles are not the mere result of mechanical damage, but are produced by the plant as a speci c response to herbivore damage. Suzuki et al. compared the case where plants produce herbivore-induced volatiles versus the case where they do not. They found that there was a case where herbivore-induced volatiles that attract carnivores resulted in the population increase of the herbivores.</p></div>

In the following section a concrete example is presented in which a constructive arti cial chemistry is applied to model social dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>. The model is based on the Random Prolog Processor (RPP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>, which is a nondeterministic model for evaluation and motivated by the work of Berry and Boudol, Fontana, Benatre, and others.</p><p>Molecules: There are three types of molecules (called information molecules): facts, rules, and goals. They are statements of a logical programming language.</p><p>Reactions: Szuba and Stras <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> report on four implemented general collision rules (inferring diagrams). What kind of inferring diagram applies depends on the type of the colliding molecules.</p><p>Dynamics: The molecular dynamics is simulated as an explicit Brownian motion in a 3D Euclidian space. Szuba and Stras <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> simulated 200-300 molecules, which required a parallel 8-processor SGI (1997). A simulation cycle consists of (a) computation of random displacement vectors such that boundary conditions are not violated (e.g., city border, reaction vessel border), (b) movement of molecules, (c) generation of subsets of molecules which are in a rendezvous distance d , and (d) processing of reactions (generate logic formulas, evaluate them, create new molecules if clauses are not false,...).</p><p>Szuba and Stras <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref> applied the RPP to model social systems. In their model a social system consists of facts, rules, and goals called molecules here. A membrane concept similar to the membrane concept of the CHAM allows a hierarchical structure. Because the computational resources needed for simulating hierarchical systems are very high only non-hierarchical systems are simulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>. The motivation is to create measures and tools to evaluate the inference power of human social structures (e.g., cities or nations).</p><p>As a benchmark problem Szuba and Stras introduced the N-step inference. The Nstep inference problem consists of N rules, one fact, and one goal. To infer the goal the N rules have to be applied sequentially in a speci c order. Szuba and Stras showed that a system that contains a "city" is able to solve the problem much faster than a system without a city. In order to model a city a spherical subspace of the RPP reactor in uences the movement of the molecules in the following way: (a) Molecules that enter the "city" can leave it only after they have stayed a certain amount of time in the "city." (b) Molecules move slower inside the city.</p><p>The obtained results are not surprising from a social science and dynamical system point of view. But the methods introduced are fascinating and a promising approach to build individual-based social simulation models. It should also be stressed that the underlying reaction mechanism based on logical inference is quite general and allows one to formulate a huge variety of interaction models easily.</p></div>

Since every living entity can be seen formally as an information processing system, generating output (in general, a certain behavior) as a result of processing the input (the current internal state and the environmental in ow), it appears evident that the basic mechanism of information processing is chemistry, and thus, to study arti cial information processing, AC is an appropriate tool.</p><p>Molecules: The idea becomes clear if we have the following metaphor in mind: As was stated by us <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the data to be processed (input and output) shall be seen as molecules, carrying a certain "meaning."

In the mid 1980s it was found that it can be used as a holographic recording medium. Important properties of this molecule are that its conformational state can be changed by photons of speci c wavelengths and that it is very robust and not destroyed when stimulated many times. In addition, the current conformational state can be easily detected by using light because the adsorption spectra of bacteriorhodopsin depends on its conformational state <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Potential applications of bacteriorhodopsin are high-density memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, hybrid electro-optical neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, and optical pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. DNA Computing Because DNA Computing is now a well established special branch of RCC, we will not discuss it in much detail here, but only give a short introduction.</p><p>DNA Computing (DNA-C) consists of two branches: Theoretical DNA-C investigates the possibilities of DNA with regard to well-known problems of computer science (e.g., universal computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, cryptology <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, or acceleration of computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>). A DNA computer model can be regarded as a constructive, analogous arti cial chemistry. It is analogous because it should model a real biochemical system accurately such that a molecule in simulation can be identi ed with a real molecule and a reaction going on in simulation should also have its counterpart in reality. One expects results forecasting the computational power of DNA.</p><p>On the other hand, DNA-C is established as "wet computing." This is mainly due to Adleman's famous experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, in which he solved a variant of the Hamiltonian path problem (a NP-complete problem in computer science) with real DNA. In the meantime these experiments have been reproduced and others are being conducted that investigate the computational power and the applicability of this approach under real conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Optimization</head><p>Another application of AC is the eld of optimization. There are evolutionary algorithms (EA), well established since the late 1960s, which bene t from the possibility of controlling evolution with an externally de ned selection scheme and tness function. Because of the ability of ACs to create evolutionary behavior (or even self-evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>), it is not a big step towards using AC for evolutionary optimization. Koza <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> created self-replicating computer programs that are self-improving and evolving. This system can be regarded as an arti cial chemistry where the molecules are computer programs and reactions take place while programs are executed.</p><p>Kanada and Hirokawa <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref> (Section 3.1.3) have demonstrated successfully the application of the Chemical Casting Model (CCM) as a new method for optimization to different constraint satisfaction problems such as graph coloring, the N-queens problem, and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Molecules (atoms) and reaction rules depend on the type of the search problem. In general, atoms are components of a potential solution of the problem. Another molecular solution of the TSP was suggested by one of us <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Ray <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> discussed the possibility of optimization in the context of Tierra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Common Phenomena</head><p>Despite the vast diversity of the different approaches in the eld of arti cial chemistry research, common phenomena can be observed. Reduction of Diversity There is a force towards reduction of diversity. This becomes visible in experiments where the reactor is initialized with maximum diversity as shown, for example, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11</ref>. In nearly all arti cial chemistries reported in the literature, the diversity reduces to either (a) a single self-replicating molecule, (b) an inert population in which no reaction takes place, (c) a simple network consisting of a few interacting molecules, or (d) a complex reaction network that may change over time and is not limited to a nite set of elements.</p><p>There is, of course, also a force increasing the diversity in constructive arti cial chemistries. A typical example where this force becomes visible is variable-length polymer chemistries where reactions may produce longer and longer sequences, thus increasing the diversity.  Formation of Densely Coupled Stable Networks From a randomly initialized population the emergence of closely coupled stable reaction networks can often be observed. This phenomenon appears in various systems despite the different representation of molecules and reaction rules. Examples are level-0 organizations in the lambda-chemistry, matrix-reaction, automata-reaction, Turing machines on tape, catalytic polymer networks, assembler automata (e.g., Tierra), and others. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">12</ref> shows three examples of stable reaction networks from different ACs. Syntactic and Semantic Closure In strongly constructive arti cial chemistries the molecules of the above-mentioned stable networks (organizations) show similarities in structure and function. This phenomenon has been analyzed by Fontana and Buss in detail and is called syntactic and semantic closure, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref> demonstrates that this phenomenon also appears in totally different arti cial chemistries such l-chemistry automata reaction matrix reaction lx 1 .lx 2 .lx 2 7240a7ef 110000 lx 1 .lx 2 .lx 3 lx 2 7240a7ea 111000 lx 1 .lx 2 .lx 3 .lx 3 7240a7eb 11110000 lx 1 .lx 2 .lx 3 .lx 4 .lx 3 7240a7ee 11100000  as matrix-multiplication chemistry or abstract automata chemistries. Following Fontana one can derive a grammar that fully describes the subset of molecules forming the surviving organization. Based on this abstract syntactic description one can also de ne an algebra that speci es the interactions among the molecules (semantic closure). This semantic description abstracts from the underlying reaction mechanism. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref> shows examples of syntactically similar molecular organizations taken from different arti cial chemistries. The similar syntactical structure allows one to describe the structure of the dominating ensemble of species in a more abstract way by a grammar and their relations by an algebra. By doing so, an organization can be described by a grammar (specifying the syntax) and an algebra (specifying the semantics) in an abstract way, so that the description is independent from the underlying reaction level. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">14</ref> shows a simple example of a level-0 organization taken from an automata chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Evolution and Punctuated Equilibrium Reaction networks may also evolve over time as has been shown for the autocatalytic polymer chemistry by Bagley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Evolution is usually induced by external noise 14 causing variations in the population. Bagley et al., for example, introduce randomly generated catalytic links between molecular sequences, which may lead to a restructuring of the metabolic network. Another frequently used method is to introduce random point mutations (e.g., bit-ips) in the structure of molecules. Examples are machine-tape chemistries <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">134]</ref> and assembler automata like Tierra <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, Avida <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, or Coreworld <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. Evolution may also take place without external, explicit mutations. In this case variation is only performed by the molecules themselves. This type of variation is called active mutation by Ikegami and Hashimoto. It has been demonstrated that an arti cial chemistry with only active mutation can show evolutionary phenomena either in the presence of an explicit, externally de ned tness function <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> or even without any explicit tness function <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion and Outlook</head><p>This paper gave a survey of the present state of research in the eld of arti cial chemistries. It provided an overview of the diverse approaches presently discussed in the literature. The goal of our paper was to introduce this diversity using a consistent nomenclature for speci c aspects of ACs and a systematic description for a meaningful comparison between different approaches. After basic concepts the main research areas were introduced, followed by different elds of applications, such as modeling, information processing, and optimization. Common features of ACs, for example, reduction of diversity of molecules or the formation of densely coupled stable networks, were discussed in Section 5.</p><p>We would like to argue that the knowledge accumulated in studying arti cial chemistries will provide a fertile ground for new ideas about the origin of life and for prebiotic evolution. By using the freedom of formulation that is offered by abstract systems resembling chemistry, the problem of life's self-organization might be better explored than by sticking to the one real chemistry that is available in nature. This does not mean, however, that one should detach from the natural system altogether. If, for instance, generic phenomena of ACs can be connected successfully to natural phenomena, these phenomena might become qualitatively predictable.</p><p>Important questions remain though: What level of abstraction for an AC is appropriate to be useful in the context of life's origin? Which key ingredients are missing in current AC systems? Do we have to incorporate detailed physical/chemical knowledge? What does evolution mean in the context of an (arti cial) chemical system? What role does self-assembly play in the emergence of novel functionality? What is the relation between evolution and self-assembly? Does "information processing" emerge by way of evolution? And if so, how?</p><p>If ACs are a subject of study in their own right, a number of questions remain to be answered: What are "natural laws" of arti cial chemistries? What are organizations and how can an AC system self-organize? How can an arti cial chemistry be investigated and analyzed? Is an arti cial chemistry able to create information? How can "evolution" be measured in general? How many meta-levels of evolution are there?</p><p>As it looks now, ACs will have many different applications. The ubiquity of interactions among isolated objects in our world stands as testimony to this potential. Starting from an analysis of possible interactions, these should be formulated in terms of objects and their interaction features. Dynamical processes will be generated from these, and can be set up in a way useful for the purpose in mind. So it might be asked, what is the relation of ACs to other domains of research, such as population dynamics, immune system dynamics, social dynamics, or economic system dynamics?</p><p>It is our conviction that arti cial chemistries in their most general formulation as abstract systems of objects that follow arbitrary rules of interaction in combinatorial spaces will in due time contribute to many different elds of inquiry. Therefore we would like to encourage readers to study systems of their own interest from this perspective.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>R then P :D remove(P , s 1 , s 2 );P :D insert(P, s 0 1 , s 0 2 , ¢ ¢ ¢ , s 0 m )I od</figDesc></figure>
