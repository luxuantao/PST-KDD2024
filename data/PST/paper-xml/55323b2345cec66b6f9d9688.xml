<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is well-known as a strongly NP-hard combinational optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which mainly deals with finding out the best sequences for processing jobs on each operable machine to achieve the required objectives subject to precedence and processing time constraints. In JSSP, each operation of a job should be processed on a predefined machine only once in a fixed operation sequence. However, the wide employment of multi-purpose machines in the real-world job shop makes it more general that an operation can be managed by several machines, i.e., there are alternative routings, which is the so-called flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP). FJSSP is a generalization of JSSP. It has more complexity than JSSP because the machine assignment problem which selects an alternative machine for each operation should also be addressed, besides the sequencing problem. Hence, FJSSP is also considered to be strongly NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In real-world manufacturing systems, it is often the case that the working environment changes dynamically by unpredictable real-time events, such as one machine fails to work suddenly, and new jobs arrive in a stochastic way. A previously optimal schedule may get poor system performance or even becomes infeasible in the new environment. Moreover, some information about the job shop is previously unknown. For example, the due date and processing time of the new job are not given until the job arrives. This kind of problems is generally known as dynamic scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. As indicated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, dynamic scheduling is of great importance to the successful implementation of real-world manufacturing systems.</p><p>In the literature reported, there are mainly three categories of dynamic scheduling technologies, which are completely reactive, predictive-reactive, and pro-active scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Among them, predictive-reactive scheduling is the most commonly used. It has a scheduling/rescheduling process where previous schedules are revised to adapt to the new environment caused by dynamic events. Most of the existing research generated a new schedule by minimizing the effect of disruption on shop efficiency like make-span <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. However, it may produce a new schedule totally different from the original one. For example, some remaining operations in the previous schedule which have not begun processing at the time of rescheduling may have their starting time accelerated or delayed. It has a serious impact on other production activities planned based on the original schedule, and brings instability and lack of continuity in the shop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Thus, both the performances of efficiency and stability should be considered in predictive-reactive scheduling. Above all, FJSSP in the real world has the dynamic and multi-objective nature.</p><p>A few literatures have rescheduled dynamic job shops based on multiple objectives. Some of them only considered the performances of efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, e.g. make-span and tardiness. The others incorporated both efficiency and stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. All the above studies used a weighted sum approach to convert multiple objectives to a single function. However, in most real-world cases, it would be difficult to identify suitable weights for each objective. On the other hand, multiple objectives such as make-span, tardiness and stability are usually conflicted with each other. It is better to handle multiple objectives with knowledge about their Pareto front. The various trade-offs among different objectives provided by the Pareto front is very useful in making an informed decision in dynamic scheduling. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been recognized to be well suited for multi-objective optimization problems due to their capability to evolve a set of solutions simultaneously in one run. In the past 20 years, MOEA received much attention, and lots of success has been achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. So far, various EAs have been applied to solve manufacturing optimization problems. To optimize cutting parameters in the multi-pass turning operations, a comparative study of ten population-based optimization algorithms was performed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, and an artificial bee colony algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and a hybrid Taguchi-differential evolution algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> were proposed, respectively. To select optimal machining parameters in milling operations, a hybrid differential evolution algorithm and a cuckoo search algorithm were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>, respectively. As to the structural and shape design optimization problem, different EAs have been investigated, such as the hybrid of immune algorithm and Taguchi method <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, the hybrid differential evolution algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, the harmony search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, the hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, Cuckoo search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, genetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, the immune algorithm combined with a hill climbing local search <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>, and the hybrid of immune and simulated annealing algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>To our best knowledge, in the literature reported, MOEA has not yet been adopted to regenerate new schedules in a predictive-reactive way when shop environments change. The primary aim of this paper is to solve MODFJSSP based on an MOEA in a modified predictive-reactive scheduling manner. With the aim of covering the shortage of existing methods, three aspects are studied: (i) the mathematical model for MODFJSSP is constructed. In the model, four objectives including both the performances of efficiency and stability are considered simultaneously. Besides, constraints to the search space change dynamically when real-time events occur, which are also addressed in the model developed; (ii) a new MOEA-based rescheduling method is proposed, which do not regenerate a new schedule from scratch, but incorporate several heuristic methods in creating the initial population, and use problem specific genetic operators for variation; and (iii) in order to select one appropriate solution from the trade-off solution set found by an MOEA, a dynamic decision making procedure is designed. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, a realistic dynamic flexible job shop is simulated with three purposes: (1) comparing the job shop performance produced by the MOEA-based rescheduling method to that of the combinations of existing heuristic rules and that of the existing static algorithms; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> analyzing different trade-offs among the four objectives, and comparing the overall performances in dynamic environments produced by three MOEAs (e-MOEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, SPEA2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>); and (3) investigating the impact and utility of the stability objective, heuristic initialization strategies and the decision making approach.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a short overview of the existing related work. Section 3 describes the problem formulation which introduces the rescheduling mode and constructs the mathematical model of MODFJSSP. In Section 4, the new MOEA-based rescheduling method for MODFJSSP and the dynamic decision making approach are described in detail. Experimental results are discussed in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>Mathematical model is very useful for understanding the problem structure, thus a few literature have focused on mathematical formulations for static FJSSP. A mathematical model was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to achieve optimal solution for small size problems. A mixed-integer linear programming model was developed for FJSSP in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, models formulated for FJSSP in literature were reviewed which categorized them as sequence-position variable based model, precedence variable based model, and time indexed model. As to the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSSP), there have been few studies describing the mathematical model. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, a dynamic rescheduling model based on Multi-Agent System was proposed. A mathematical model for DFJSSP which minimized a weighted sum of two objectives (make-span and stability) was developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. It used binary variables to form constraints, which would introduce a lot of binary parameters.</p><p>Besides, the definition of make-span at a specific rescheduling point is not given. In this paper, a dynamic multi-objective optimization model for DFJSSP which can capture the dynamic characteristics of both objectives (related to efficiency and stability) and constraints are constructed. DFJSSP is formulated in our model in a more comprehensible way. Stability measures the deviation between revised and original schedules, and there is no universal definition for stability. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, stability was defined as the number of times rescheduling occurred. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, stability was defined as the starting time deviation and operation sequence deviation. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, stability had two dimensions. One was the starting time deviation, and the other reflected how close to the current time changes were made. In our model, a more sophisticated definition for stability is presented which captures the deviation of operation starting time accelerating, starting time delay and completion time delay between two successive schedules, respectively.</p><p>Generally, there are mainly four research directions on multi-objective dynamic job shop scheduling in the existing literature. The first class developed customized rules before the running of a job shop. A co-evolutionary genetic programming method was developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for simultaneous design of dispatching rules and due-date assignment rules. Gene express programming was adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to evolve machine assignment rules and job dispatching rules together in DFJSSP. This kind of methods is suitable for off-line optimization.</p><p>The second class belongs to completely reactive scheduling. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, at each scheduling point, an existing dispatching rule that performed best was determined by looking up the idiotypic network model constructed in advance. A heuristic was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> to implement the reactive scheduling in a dynamic production environment where jobs arrive over time.</p><p>A multiple attribute decision making technique which used grey numbers to deal with uncertainties was given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> to determine which lot was suitable to be processed next when a machine was free. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> focused on the implementation concept of a discrete event simulation based ''online near-real-time'' dynamic scheduling system using conjunctive simulated scheduling. Completely reactive scheduling is quick to implement, but it considers only the local information, so the shop performance cannot be guaranteed. It is suitable for online dynamic scheduling.</p><p>The third class is called the predictive-reactive scheduling, which uses the global information and searches in a larger solution space in comparison with completely reactive scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, an adaptive variable neighborhood search was triggered in respond to a random event. A conventional genetic algorithm was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to regenerate a new schedule whenever a dynamic event occurred. However, it is often inefficient to restart the optimization process with a totally new population <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In order to solve the instability problem induced by unrestricted rescheduling, bi-objectives of stability and efficiency were considered simultaneously in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, respectively. However, the weighted sum method was adopted in all the above studies to deal with multiple objectives. Predictive-reactive scheduling is also suitable for online dynamic scheduling. In our paper, we solve MODFJSSP based on an MOEA in a modified predictive-reactive scheduling way.</p><p>The fourth class can be categorized as the pro-active scheduling, which builds predictive schedules in advance. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> introduced four different probability distributions to model stochastic processing times, and proposed three uncertainty handling methods to estimate the fitness of a solution. A multi-objective immune algorithm is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> to produce robust scheduling solutions of uncertain scheduling problems described by the workflow simulation scheduling model.</p><p>A simplified multi-objective genetic algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for the stochastic JSSP with exponential processing times. A robust and stable predictive schedule for one machine scheduling, JSSP, and FJSSP with random machine breakdowns was generated by a genetic algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, respectively. A robust genetic algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to minimize the make-span of a parallel machine scheduling problem with fuzzy processing times. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, parallel machine scheduling with learning effects and fuzzy processing times was solved by the simulated annealing algorithm and the genetic algorithm. In this class of methods, optimization is performed offline.</p><p>Decision making is an important process in evolutionary multi-objective optimization, especially in the dynamic case.</p><p>However, few attentions have been paid to this aspect. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, only problems with bi-objectives were considered, and a precise weight value of each objective should be provided by the decision maker (DM). However, the DM usually does not have enough knowledge about objective functions. When expressing preferences, they prefer to employ the qualitative language like ''Objective A is more important than objective B'' to describe the relative importance between two objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. For this reason, in our paper, linguistic terms are used to represent the DM's vague thought instead of requiring them to give numerical values so as to reduce his/her cognitive overload.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Rescheduling mode</head><p>In order to infuse more reality in job shops, random new job arrivals and machine breakdowns (repairs) are considered.</p><p>Among them, urgent job arrivals, machine breakdowns and repairs are regarded as critical events, and regular job arrivals are uncritical events.</p><p>A modified predictive-reactive dynamic scheduling is adopted. A production schedule for all the jobs at the initial time is generated at first. In order to reduce the rescheduling frequency, a critical-event-driven mode is employed. Once a critical event occurs, the rescheduling method is triggered. The time at which a new schedule is constructed is called the rescheduling point, and the time span between two successive rescheduling points is named the rescheduling interval. Besides, a special case is considered. Suppose by the time instant t ⁄ after a specific rescheduling point t l , all the scheduled jobs have finished so that all the available machines are idle, and the next critical event has not occurred. If the number of regular job arrivals between t l and t ⁄ is larger than an upper bound, then a new schedule is constructed for these new uncritical jobs to make full use of the machine resources. We call it the resource-idle-driven mode. The upper bound is set to be 5 here.</p></div>

Here, C i (t l ) represents the completion time of all the current available operations of job J i (t l ). This is because by t l , some operations might have become unavailable due to the occurrences of dynamic events. For example, the operation O 47 cannot be processed because all of its alternative machines broke down before or at t l , and have not gotten repaired by t l . The succeeding operations O 48 and O 49 become unavailable either, because no pre-emption is allowed. Thus at t l , C 4 (t l ) is the completion time of the last available operation</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">O 46 .</formula><p>The tardiness measure f 2 (t l ) in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) is defined as the weighted sum of differences between the completion time and due date of each job in which its completion time is larger than the due date. Similar to C i (t l ), DD i (t l ) is the due date for all the current available operations of job J i (t l ). According to this characteristic, it is generated by a modification to the commonly used total work content (TWK) rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">DD i ðt l Þ ¼ a i þ K Ã i X j¼1;2;...; I i ðt l Þþn 0 i ðt l ÞÀ1 Average p ij<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where DD i (t l ) is equal to the sum of the job arrival time and a multiple of the total average processing time from the first operation to the last available operation.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) has three terms. The first term is the starting time deviation of operations which are rescheduled to start processing at an earlier time multiplied by a weight c, where c &gt; 1. It gives more penalties to bring forward the starting time of an operation, because rush order cost is incurred if the delivery of materials is required earlier than planned based on the original schedule. Here, we set c = 1.5. The second term is the starting time deviation of operations which are rescheduled to begin processing at a later time. This case may lead to carrying costs because materials are delivered earlier than required. The third term is the completion time deviation of operations which have their ending time delayed, and it causes the deterioration of delivery performance.</p><p>It should be mentioned that at the initial time t 0 , only three objectives which are make-span, tardiness and the maximal machine workload (without stability) are to be optimized.</p><p>In the dynamic flexible job shop, constraints to the search space change dynamically with occurrences of random events.</p><p>They are listed as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">3.2.1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Framework of the predictive-reactive scheduling method</head><p>The flowchart of our predictive-reactive scheduling in MODFJSSP is summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. At the initial time of the shop floor, a predictive schedule is generated by an MOEA considering three objectives which are make-span, tardiness and the maximal machine workload. Then during the implementation of the schedule, at each rescheduling point, an MOEA-based rescheduling method is triggered to construct a new schedule by considering four objectives which are make-span, tardiness, the maximal machine workload and stability simultaneously. The newly generated schedule is implemented in the job shop until the next rescheduling point comes, at which time the rescheduling method is triggered again. In short, MODFJSSP is a dynamic process formed by a sequence of multi-objective FJSSPs with different sets of job operations and machines to be scheduled. This process continues until all the jobs appearing in the shop floor have finished. At each scheduling point, a set of non-dominated solutions are obtained by an MOEA. Thus one solution that fits into the DM's preferences is selected by a decision making procedure and implemented in the shop floor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The e-MOEA-based rescheduling method for MODFJSSP</head><p>As indicated in Section 4.1, MODFJSSP can be seen as a dynamic process formed by a sequence of multi-objective FJSSPs.</p><p>However, we should not just treat MODFJSSP as a sequence of independent static problems and use the existing static MOEAs to solve it. There are mainly four reasons for that: (1) these problems are not independent and they are related to each other.</p><p>At each rescheduling point, a new FJSSP with an updated set of job operations and machines is formed and to be scheduled.</p><p>Most operations in the current problem are composed of unprocessed operations left from the previous schedule, and most of the machines are the same as those of the prior problem; (2) in a real-world job shop system, stability and continuity which means there should be a small difference between the new generated schedule and the original one are very important. So when rescheduling, arrangements in the previous schedule should be taken into account; (3) MODFJSSP is a dynamic problem thus some dynamic optimization strategies should be introduced to make the algorithm adapt to the changing environments quickly. Here, the features of different dynamic events can be utilized to guide the searching direction; and (4) as indicated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, it is often inefficient to restart the dynamic optimization process with a totally effort, especially when dealing with many objectives (3 or more) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. MODFJSSP studied in this paper is a dynamic problem with four objectives. In order to solve it in an efficient way, an e-MOEA-based rescheduling method is proposed. Meanwhile, to keep the system stability and continuity in mind, and to exploit the information left from the original schedule and the characteristics of different dynamic events, our e-MOEA-based rescheduling method is featured with three points: (1) some heuristic strategies are incorporated in constructing the initial population of e-MOEA at each rescheduling point; (2) new individual representations and two kinds of problem specific variation operators are designed so that the proposed method can handle operation sequencing and machine assignment simultaneously; and (3) the stability objective is considered together with the shop efficiency (make-span, tardiness, the maximal machine workload) for multi-objective optimization in our approach. The procedure of e-MOEA-based rescheduling method at the rescheduling point t l (t l &gt; t 0 ) is presented below.</p><p>Step 1: Initialization: Construct the initial population P(t l ) by some heuristic strategies according to the updated job shop state at t l . Then multi-objective evaluations are performed, and all the non-dominated solutions are determined to form the initial archive population A(t l ). Set the counter of objective evaluation numbers ct = population_size.</p><p>Step 2: Population selection: One individual sp is chosen from the population P(t l ). Here, the tournament selection method is used. Two individuals are picked up uniformly at random from the population, and check the domination of each other. If one dominates the other, the former will be chosen. Otherwise, one of them is selected at random.</p><p>Step 3: Archive selection: One solution e is chosen uniformly at random from the archive A(t l ).</p><p>Step 4: Variation: Two offspring sc 1 and sc 2 are generated from sp and e by two kinds of problem specific variation operators.</p><p>Step 5: Decoding and objective evaluation: Evaluate the offspring individuals sc 1 and sc 2 .</p><p>Step 6: Update of the population: Offspring individuals sc 1 and sc 2 are included in P(t l ) using a pop_acceptance procedure.</p><p>Step 7: Update of the archive: Individuals sc 1 and sc 2 are included in A(t l ) using an archive_acceptance procedure.</p><p>Step 8: Termination: If the termination criterion is not satisfied, set ct = ct + 2 and go to Step 2, else output A(t l ), and select one solution from A(t l ) as the implementation schedule based on a decision making procedure.</p><p>In the above Steps 6 and 7, the pop_acceptance and archive_acceptance procedures are the same as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The termination criterion is the counter ct achieves a predefined maximum number of objective evaluations. It should be mentioned that at the initial time t 0 of the job shop, the e-MOEA used to generate a set of predictive schedules is also based on the procedure introduced above. The differences are that the random population initialization is used in Step 1 instead of the heuristic population initialization, and when evaluating an individual, only three objectives (without stability) are considered. Details of our implementation for the e-MOEA-based rescheduling method and the decision making procedure will be discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Representations</head><p>In MODFJSSP, both the operation sequence vector and the machine assignment vector are used to represent a complete scheduling individual. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> gives an example of such a representation.</p><p>For the operation sequence vector, a job-based representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is used. All the operations from the same job are denoted by the job number. Take Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> as an example. Suppose at a specific rescheduling point, the operations O 69 , O 76 and O 77 from jobs 6 and 7 are left unprocessed from the previous schedule, and there are two new jobs 8 and 9. Thus, the operation sequence vector contains the job numbers 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each operation is interpreted according to its order of appearance in the sequence vector. For example, the first appearance of number 8 represents O 81 , the second appearance of 8 means O 82 , and so on. So the operation sequence vector in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> can be interpreted as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">O 76 1 O 81 1 O 69 1 O 82 1 O 91 1 O 77 1 O 92 1 O 83 1 O 93 1 O 84</formula><p>where a 1 b means operation a joins the waiting queue of its assigned machine first, then operation b is scheduled.</p><p>The machine assignment vector represents the assigned machine of each operation. The order is from the first remaining operation of the oldest job (with the minimum job index) to the last remaining operation of the newest job (with the maximum job index). For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, suppose the current available machines are 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10. In the machine assignment vector, the first element of 3 means the first remaining operation O 69 of the oldest job 6 will be assigned to machine 3, the second element of 6 represents the first remaining operation O 76 of the second oldest job 7 will be assigned to machine 6, and so on. Thus, the machine assignment vector can be interpreted as: where ? means the operation is assigned to the corresponding machine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Decoding</head><p>For the convenience of objective evaluation, a scheduling solution should be decoded into the form of Gantt chart. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> gives the Gantt chart of the chromosome represented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Assume the rescheduling point in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> is t l = 10, and at t l = 10, two operations O 68 and O 75 in the previous schedule are being processed on machine 6 and 5, respectively. The predefined processing time of each operation on the assigned machine is listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we can see that the sequence of operations is: <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, where the number in the parentheses is the machine assignment of each operation. The process of constructing the Gantt chart in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> is described as follows. First, take the first operation O 76 in the operation sequence into account. Since O 76 is also assigned to machine 6, it can be processed until both O 75 (its previous operation in the same job 7) and O 68 (its previous operation in the same machine 6) have finished due to the no preemption constraints. Then, since the second operation O 81 is the first operation of job 8 and its assigned machine 3 is idle, it is scheduled at t l = 10 for a processing time of 0.5 time units. Next, the third operation O 69 is to be processed on machine 3 at the maximum value of the completion time of O 68 and O 81 . The following operations in the operation sequence are scheduled to the assigned machines following the same method.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">O 76 (6) 1 O 81 (3) 1 O 69 (3) 1 O 82 (2) 1 O 91 (9) 1 O 77 (5) 1 O 92 (10) 1 O 83 (2) 1 O 93 (5) 1 O 84</formula><p>It should be noted that the idle time insertion method which inserts an operation into the first available idle time interval of its assigned machine is used to make full use of the machine resources. For example, O 93 goes after O 77 on machine 5 according to the operation sequence in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. But in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, there is an interval of idle time on machine 5 between the completion time of O 92 (11.2) and the starting time of O 77 <ref type="bibr">(11.8)</ref>. Meanwhile, the processing time of O 93 (0.4) is smaller than the length of the time interval (11.8 À 11.2 = 0.6). Thus O 93 is inserted into this interval and begins at the completion time of O 92 <ref type="bibr">(11.2)</ref>. Let L(t l ) be the total number of operations to be processed at t l , and W(i, j) be the locus of O ij (t l ) in the machine assignment vector. The pseudo code of the decoding procedure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Update of the job shop state</head><p>Once the rescheduling procedure is triggered, the shop state should be updated at first. (i) At t l , information left from the previous schedule should be collected, which includes the remaining unprocessed operations, and the operations that are being processed on each machine at t l . Meanwhile, information about new arrival jobs since the previous rescheduling point t lÀ1 and the current available machines must also be gathered.</p></div>

By t l , if some machines have broken down and thus become unavailable, they should be removed from the machine set of each operation. For a specific operation, if there is no machine available to process it, then it will not enter the rescheduling model at t l . On the other hand, if a broken machine has been repaired by t l , it must rejoin the machine set of corresponding operations. Meanwhile, all the operations that cannot be processed temporarily due to the previous breakdown of the repaired machine, must be added to the rescheduling model at t l .</p><p>(iii) Update the machine available time A k (t l ) and job release time R i (t l ) according to the initial state constraints (Eqs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)) for all the current machines and jobs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4.">Construction of the initial population in rescheduling</head><p>At each rescheduling point, a new multi-objective FJSSP with an updated set of job operations and machines is formed and to be scheduled. In order to guide the search of the e-MOEA-based rescheduling method and accelerate the convergence speed so that the method can adapt to the new environment quickly, some heuristic methods are incorporated in creating the initial population of e-MOEA, which makes the proposed rescheduling methods different from those completely rescheduling approaches that regenerate a new schedule from scratch <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>.</p><p>(i) Make use of the characteristics of different dynamic events. As indicated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, schedule repair refers to local adjustments of the original schedule, and it can preserve the system stability well. Hence, three schedule repairs are employed here to exploit the dynamic event characteristics. Firstly, for machine breakdowns, a modification to the partial schedule repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is designed. All the unaffected operations remain unchanged both for their machines and starting times. The directly affected operations (previously scheduled on the broken machine and unprocessed) are moved to another alternative machine if possible, and the indirectly affected operations are assigned to the same machines as before. Only the sequences of the affected operations are rescheduled. Secondly, for machine repairs, some operations are shifted to the repaired machine so as to balance the machine workload. These operations should satisfy that they can be processed by the repaired machine, and the shift will not affect the starting time of other operations. Thirdly, for new job arrivals, a new job is scheduled as soon as one of its alternative machines becomes idle. The result of schedule repair is called the schedule repair solution.</p><p>(ii) Make use of the history information. At each rescheduling point, information left from the previous schedule is regarded as the history information which can be exploited. The sequence and machine assignment vector of all the remaining unprocessed operations in the old schedule is called the history solution.</p><p>(iii) Make use of the heuristic machine assignment rules. Two machine assignment rules following the approach of localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> are adopted. The first rule searches for the global minimum in the processing time table <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Then it fixes that assignment, and updates the machine workload on every other operation. The second rule randomly permutes jobs and machines in the processing time table at first. Then for each operation, it finds the machine with the minimum processing time, fixes that assignment, and updates the machine workload. The first rule determines the machine assignment for each operation uniquely, while the second rule finds different assignments in different runs of the rules.</p><p>(iv) Incorporation of random individuals. In order to introduce diversity, some random individuals are created in the initial population. Sequence vectors are generated by permuting all the current operations at random. For half of these  random individuals, machine assignments are determined according to the two rules described above. Each operation in another half is assigned to a randomly chosen machine from its machine available set.</p><p>In this paper, 20% of the initial populations are formed with the history solution and its variants by mutation (as introduced in Section 4.2.5), 30% with the schedule repair solution and its variants, and 50% with the random individuals. Step i: All the current available jobs at the rescheduling point t l are divided uniformly at random into two groups: G 1 and G 2 .</p><p>Step ii: The operations from the first job group G 1 are picked from Parent Step iii: All of the recorded operations in R 1 and R 2 are merged according to their original sequences to generate an offspring.</p><p>Another offspring is generated using the same method described above, except that the operations from G 1 are picked from Parent 2 , and the operations from G 2 are picked from Parent 1 . This procedure is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. When merging, if two operations have the same positions in the parents, such as jobs 6 and 7 in the third order of each parent in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>, their sequence in the offspring is generated uniformly at random. The sequence based mutation operator is the commonly used swap and insert operators. The swap operator selects two operations in the operation sequence vector at random, and exchanges the positions of them. The insert operator inserts one randomly selected operation before another one. When performing a mutation on an individual, either the swap or the insert is chosen with the possibility of 0.5.</p><p>It should be noted that when performing the sequence based variation operators, the machine assignment vector is kept unchanged. Since our representation of the machine assignment vector given in Section 4.2.1 is not related to the operation sequence, the variation of the sequence vector will not affect it. This will not cause the potential infeasibility problem when performing the swap or insert operator, which would otherwise be faced if we had used the representation where each machine corresponds to each operation in the operation sequence vector as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. 4.2.5.2. Machine based variation operators. In the representation of the machine assignment vector given in Section 4.2.1, the machines in the same positions of two parents correspond to the same operation. So the traditional single point crossover can be used. The mutation operator is performed as follows. An allele is chosen randomly, and the machine on which the operation is to be processed is replaced with one of the alternative machines. Similarly, when performing the machine based variation operators, the operation sequence vector is kept unchanged in the offspring.</p></div>

The set of alternative machines that can process each operation are randomly selected from {1, 2, . . . , m}.</p><p>The processing time of each operation follows the exponential distribution with the mean of 1.</p><p>For each machine, the time interval between fails (TBF) and the time to repair (TTR) are also assumed to follow an exponential distribution. To infuse realism into the simulation, each machine was assigned different mean time between failure (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR). MTBF and MTTR vary uniformly in [100, 300] and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">120]</ref>, respectively.</p><p>These values were chosen such that on average, a machine is available for 130 time units, then breaks down and gets repaired for 70 time units. Hence, a machine's availability is 65%.</p><p>Simulation starts with a 10 Â 10 static flexible job shop problem, where the initial numbers of jobs and machines are both 10. Then new jobs arrive following the Poisson distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, so the time between new job arrivals is distributed exponentially. Suppose the mean time between job arrivals (MTBJA) is 0.625. New jobs are assigned random weights such that the weights of 20% of jobs are 1, 60% are 2, and 20% are 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Here, jobs with weight 1 and weight 2 are of less importance and average importance, respectively, both of which are considered as regular jobs. Jobs with weight 4 are urgent jobs which are of high importance.</p><p>Simulation continues until the number of jobs which have arrived at the shop floor reaches 1240.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Pareto fronts of the evolved schedules at rescheduling points</head><p>At each rescheduling point, a set of non-dominated solutions was evolved by an MOEA-based rescheduling method.</p><p>In order to demonstrate the trade-offs among these solutions, one rescheduling point was selected at random and taken as an example. At t l = 344.2344, machine 7 broke down, and only machines 1, 4, 5, 8, 10 were available. By this time instant, 544 jobs had already arrived in the shop floor, and there were totally 26 jobs with 116 operations left to be processed. 30 independent runs of each of the three MOEA-based (e-MOEA, NSGA-II, and SPEA2) rescheduling methods were performed. The evolved Pareto fronts in each run of each algorithm were combined, and the non-dominated solutions were determined from them. Since there are totally four objectives to be optimized, the obtained aggregated Pareto front cannot be plotted graphically. We pick three objectives from the four in turn, and give the 3-D plot of them respectively in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>. Firstly, it is obvious from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>(b)-(d) that the efficiency objectives are seriously conflicted with the stability measure. When tracing along the Pareto front to find solutions that have high efficiency (small make-span, tardiness and workload), it can be observed that the stability measure becomes worse. Secondly, it can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>(a) that given a similar value of workload, there is also a slight conflict between the objectives of make-span and tardiness. A smaller make-span normally leads to a larger tardiness. Thirdly, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>(c) suggests that given a similar value of stability, there is little conflict between the make-span and the workload, which means that a small make-span requires a small maximal workload. This is reasonable because a small make-span implies full use of the resources to finish all the current operations as soon as possible, thus the workload balance among different machines can be achieved. All the above observations suggest that solutions that provide better performance of shop efficiency will result in the deterioration in the system stability. There is no solution that can simultaneously optimize all the considered objectives.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">4</ref> gives several examples of the objective vectors selected from the aggregated Pareto front. A solution may perform well for one objective, but give bad results for others, such as Solution 1 -Solution 4 . And one solution may have a 'not bad' value on each objective, which means a good compromise among all the objectives, such as Solution 5 -Solution 7 . Pareto front produced by the MOEA-based method can provide the DM with a full knowledge about the various trade-offs among multiple objectives. It is helpful for him/her to make an informed decision about the 'best compromise' with regards to his/her preference.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1.">Performance measures</head><p>Four popular metrics are employed to evaluate the performances of MOEA-based methods. The first one is the hypervolume ratio (HVR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The hypervolume metric HV measures the size of the objective space dominated by the obtained non-dominated front PF known <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, and HVR is the ratio of HV and the hypervolume of the reference Pareto front</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">PF ref .</formula><p>The second one is the Generational Distance (GD), which measures how far PF known from PF ref is <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The third one is Spacing which measures the distance variance of neighboring vectors in PF known <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The smaller Spacing is, the better the distribution uniformity of PF known is. The fourth one is Spread, which measures the extent of spread achieved among the obtained solutions and the non-uniformity in the distribution of PF known. The definition of Spread in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> was used for bi-objective problems. As to problems with three or more objectives, a modified Spread is given in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">17</ref>):   </p><formula xml:id="formula_26">Spread ¼ P N o j¼1 df j þ P n PF i¼1 d 0 i À d 0 P N o j¼1 df j þ n PF Á d 0<label>ð17Þ</label></formula><p>where df j is the Euclidean distance between the best solution on the jth objective and its nearest solution in PF known (i.e., the boundary solution), n PF is the number of vectors in PF known , d 0 i is the Euclidean distance from the ith vector of PF known to its nearest neighbor in PF known , and d 0 is the mean of all d 0 i . A wide and uniform spread of solutions in PF known will result in a small value of Spread.</p><p>Because the true Pareto front is unknown in MODFJSSP, PF ref is obtained by merging the solutions found during all the independent runs of three MOEA-based methods, and determine the non-dominated solutions from them. The reference point in HVR is formed with the worst objective values observed in all the optimization runs. To significantly compare all the algorithms, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with significance level of 0.05 were employed and the results were given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">5</ref>. When the statistical test indicated that there was significant difference between A and B, the effect size which quantifies how large the difference is between two data sets was checked. The effect size of Cohen's d <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> was used, and it was calculated using the pooled standard deviation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">d ¼ ðmean A À mean B Þ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi std 2 A þstd 2 B 2 q<label>ð18Þ</label></formula><p>where mean ii denotes the average value on the considered metric obtained by algorithm ii in the 30 independent runs, and std ii denotes the corresponding standard deviation, ii 2 fA; Bg.</p><p>Average CPU time consumed by each of the three methods, and the corresponding standard deviation in the 30 runs in the initial 10 Â 10 static FJSSP are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">6</ref>.</p><p>It can be seen that HVRs produced by e-MOEA and NSGA-II are significantly better than that of SPEA2. The values of GD and Spread obtained by e-MOEA are significantly better than those of NSGA-II and SPEA2. In terms of Spacing, there is no significant difference among the three methods, but the standard deviation of Spacing obtained by e-MOEA is slightly smaller than those obtained by NSGA-II and SPEA2. In addition, the computational cost of e-MOEA is much smaller than that of NSGA-II and SPEA2. The experimental results show that e-MOEA can produce a set of scheduling solutions with better convergence and distribution within a shorter period of time. Thus, it is the most competitive algorithm for the initial 10 Â 10 static FJSSP studied in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.3.2.2.</head><p>Performance comparisons in the dynamic job shop. This section gives the overall performance comparisons of the three MOEA-based rescheduling methods during the dynamic process of the job shop. In this experiment, one complete run of the dynamic job shop instance (data is provided in Appendix A) was performed, and there were totally 220 rescheduling points.</p><p>At each rescheduling point, 30 independent runs of each MOEA were performed. In this way, it can be ensured that three MOEA-based methods were compared in the same job shop scenarios. All the solution sets obtained in 30 runs of three methods were merged, and the non-dominated solutions were determined from them to form the reference Pareto front at the specific rescheduling point. Then the performance values (HVR, GD, Spacing, Spread) of each MOEA in each run at each rescheduling point could be obtained, and the overall performances across the rescheduling points in MODFJSSP were compared.</p><p>Firstly, the average performance values across rescheduling points were calculated. For each run of each MOEA, the performance values were averaged over all the rescheduling points during the interval of last 1000 new job arrivals. Thus, 30 mean values could be obtained for each MOEA on each performance metric (because the number of runs was 30 here).</p><p>Then the 30 mean values were averaged, and the corresponding mean standard deviation across rescheduling points was calculated by means of the pooled standard deviation as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">std pooled ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi std 2 1 þ Á Á Á þ std 2 jj þ Á Á Á þ std 2 n 1 n 1 s<label>ð19Þ</label></formula><p>where n 1 is the number of runs (30 in our case), std jj is the standard deviation across rescheduling points in the jjth run. The obtained average performances across rescheduling points are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">7</ref>(a). It can be seen that e-MOEA achieves the GD is larger than that on HVR, which shows that e-MOEA is very good at obtaining better GD performance. These results</p><p>indicate that e-MOEA has the best convergence performance among the three MOEA methods. In terms of the distribution metrics, Spacing produced by e-MOEA is significantly better than that of NSGA-II, and there is no significant difference between e-MOEA and SPEA2. However, the effect size of e-MOEA vs. NSGA-II is slightly larger than that of SPEA2 vs.</p><p>NSGA-II. For Spread, SPEA2 is significantly better than e-MOEA and NSGA-II, which is consistent with the result of average performances. The reason for the relatively poor performance of e-MOEA on Spread is that this metric quantifies the extent of spread achieved among the obtained solutions and it is biased towards the boundary solutions. Since e-MOEA employs e-dominance in the archive update procedure, it will not be usually possible to obtain the extreme corners of the Pareto- optimal front <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The mean CPU time of three MOEA-based methods at each rescheduling point is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref>, which shows that the computational time cost by e-MOEA is much smaller than that of NSGA-II and SPEA2 throughout all the rescheduling points.</p><p>From experimental results in both initial static FJSSP and the dynamic flexible job shop, it can be concluded that the e-MOEA-based rescheduling method is most competitive among the three algorithms for evolving efficient non-dominated scheduling solutions in the problem instance studied in this paper, since it can achieve the best convergence and find a good distribution of solutions in a much less computational time than the other two MOEA-based methods (i.e., NSGA-II and SPEA2). Reasons for a better compromise of e-MOEA between convergence, diversity and computational efficiency are <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>:</p><p>(1) it adopts careful strategies in choosing mating partners from two co-evolving populations (an EA population and an archive population) and in accepting the generated offspring to each population; (2) The e-dominance criterion used can help reduce the cardinality of Pareto-optimal region and maintain a good distribution of the solutions, which is useful when solving the many-objective problems; and (3) its parent population is updated in a steady-state manner, thus it has higher chances of producing good offspring solutions, and high computational speed can be achieved. In contrast, NSGA-II and SPEA2 are two generational algorithms. The nearest neighbor density estimation approach makes SPEA2 find a well distributed set of solutions but at the expense of very large computational time, and it has been validated that the crowding operator in NSGA-II is not adequate in keeping a good distribution of solutions in many-objective problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Comparisons to existing dynamic scheduling methods</head><p>With the aim of further validating the effectiveness of the proposed MOEA-based rescheduling methods in MODFJSSP, we compared them with the commonly used completely reactive scheduling methods, which assigns operations to different machines according to a specific machine assignment rule, and once a machine becomes idle and there are operations in its waiting queue, it chooses the operation with the highest priority to process based on a heuristic priority dispatching rule.</p><p>Four popular priority dispatching rules (PDRs) which are Shortest Processing Time (SPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and the random dispatching rule were employed. At each rescheduling point, there may be some operations which need to be assigned to an available machine. For example, the operations of the new arrival jobs, the operations that are waiting in the queue of the broken machine, and some previously unavailable operations become available again due to the machine repairs. We considered three machine assignment rules (MARs) for such operations. The first one finds the available machine with the minimum processing time for each operation, then fixes that assignment, and updates the machine workload. The second one assigns each operation to its alternative machine which has the minimum workload currently. The third one chooses an alternative machine at random for each operation. We call them MAR1, MAR2, and MAR3 in short.</p><p>Combinations of four PDRs and three MARs were evaluated. Since the principle of the completely reactive scheduling (make local decisions once a machine becomes free) is different from that of the proposed MOEA-based methods (make global decisions and revise the schedule at each rescheduling point), the objectives in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) which are defined for each rescheduling point are not applicable to the completely reactive scheduling methods. Thus, we compared three other performances which are finishing time of all the jobs, weighted average job tardiness, and average machine workload during the whole running process of the dynamic flexible job shop. 30 independent runs of the dynamic job shop instance (data is provided in Appendix A) were replicated for each combination of the PDRs and MARs, and also for the three MOEAs. Average results are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">8</ref>.</p><p>It can be found that compared to the completely reactive scheduling, the proposed MOEA-based rescheduling methods make the job shop finish processing all the jobs in a much smaller time. Meanwhile, they have a much less average delay to the due dates of the jobs. In terms of the average machine workload, the combinations containing MAR1 achieve better performance than MOEA-based methods. The reason is that MAR1 always assigns an operation to its alternative machine with the minimum processing time, which tends to reduce the total workload of all the machines. But on the other hand, it may lead to long waiting queues in specific machines, and idleness of the others, which results in a long finishing time of all the jobs and a large tardiness. Considering three MOEA-based methods, the performance vector obtained by e-MOEA dominates that generated by NSGA-II or SPEA2. Overall, compared to the traditional completely reactive scheduling, the proposed MOEA-based rescheduling methods can improve the dynamic job shop efficiency to a large extent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Comparisons to existing static algorithms</head><p>With the aim to observe the consequence caused by using the existing static algorithms to solve MODFJSSP, our e-MOEA-based rescheduling method is compared with two classical static MOEAs (we call them static NSGA-II and static SPEA2 here). It is assumed that MODFJSSP can be divided into some static FJSSP, and the two static MOEAs are run many times to solve each static problem. Here, static NSGA-II and static SPEA2 are different from the ones employed in Section 5.3.2 in that: (1) the initial population are generated at random and no heuristic strategies are incorporated at each rescheduling point, so the two MOEAs regenerate a new schedule from scratch; and (2) stability is not considered as an objective and only three shop efficiency related objectives (make-span, tardiness, the maximal machine workload) are optimized. On the other hand, to make static NSGA-II and static SPEA2 solve each static FJSSP, individual representations in Section 4.2.1 and two problem specific variation operators designed in Section 4.2.5 are used in static NSGA-II and static SPEA2.</p><p>The comparison method in the dynamic job shop is similar to that used in Section 5.3.2. Average performances, effect size of Cohen's d, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests of our e-MOEA-based rescheduling method, static NSGA-II and static SPEA2 across rescheduling points are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">9</ref>. It can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">9</ref>(a) that e-MOEA achieves the best mean value on all the four metrics HVR, GD, Spacing, and Spread. It can be found from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">9</ref>(b) that HVR and GD obtained by e-MOEA are significantly better than those of static NSGA-II and static SPEA2. These results indicate that e-MOEA has much better convergence performance than static MOEAs. In terms of the distribution metrics, Spacing produced by e-MOEA is significantly better than that of static NSGA-II, and there is no significant difference between e-MOEA and static SPEA2. However, the effect size of e-MOEA vs. static NSGA-II is slightly larger than that of static SPEA2 vs. NSGA-II. For Spread, e-MOEA is significantly better than that of static NSGA-II and static SPEA2.</p><p>From above comparison results, it can be concluded that the proposed heuristic population initialization and simultaneous consideration of the stability and efficiency in the job shop are very useful for solving MODFJSSP, since they can capture the correlations between the sequence of multi-objective FJSSPs and guide the search of e-MOEA so that our e-MOEA-based rescheduling method can find the solution to the new problem effectively and efficiently. In contrast, each static FJSSP is regarded as independent by static NSGA-II and static SPEA2 and they just search the large decision space from scratch each time, so their searching efficiency is highly reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Further analysis</head><p>In this section, we will investigate the effectiveness of some strategies employed in the proposed MOEA-based rescheduling methods.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.1.">Influence of the stability objective</head><p>In this section, we will study the impact that the stability objective has on the performance of the MOEA-based methods.</p><p>Results from two types of approaches were compared. There were four objectives in approach 1 , and in approach 2 only three objectives on the shop efficiency were considered. Both approaches used the three MOEA-based methods (e-MOEA, NSGA-II, and SPEA2). First, at each rescheduling point, 30 independent runs of each MOEA in approach 1 were performed. All the solution sets obtained in each run of each MOEA were merged, and the non-dominated solutions at each rescheduling point were determined. Then they were averaged along each of the four objectives, and plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. The same method was also adopted for approach 2 (only three objectives on efficiency were considered in the non-domination comparisons in MOEA-based methods. The stability values were evaluated only for the obtained non-dominated solutions to compare with approach 1 ). The reason for using the average values along each objective is that we expect to check the overall performance improvement (or deterioration) on individual objectives by using the stability as one of the multiple objectives.</p><p>At the rescheduling point t l , the quantitative improvement (or deterioration) of approach 1 (with stability) over approach 2 (without stability) on each objective is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">Imp i ðt l Þ ¼ À ðAvg f approach 1 i ðt l Þ À Avg f approach 2 i ðt l ÞÞ Avg f approach 2 i ðt l Þ Â 100%<label>ð20Þ</label></formula><p>where Avg f approach 1 i ðt l Þ and Avg f approach 2 i ðt l Þ represent the average values of the non-dominated solutions obtained by approach 1 and approach 2 on the objective f i at t l , respectively. Since all the objectives considered are to be minimized, we use a negative sign in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. The overall improvement (or deterioration) on each objective f i is the average value of Imp i (t l ) over all the rescheduling points during the interval of last 1000 new job arrivals, which are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">10</ref>. It can be seen that compared to approach 2 (without stability), approach 1 (with stability) improves the system stability significantly with a small sacrifice in the shop efficiency. The improvement in stability is much more than the deterioration in efficiency, which suggests that if we solve MODFJSSP by simultaneously considering stability and efficiency, we will have a high chance of obtaining more stable solutions without severely affecting the efficiency. This result is very practical since stability is an important factor in the real-world job shop.   <ref type="figure">9</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.2.">Influence of the heuristic initialization strategy</head><p>As indicated in Section 4.2.4, at each rescheduling point, to guide the search of the e-MOEA-based rescheduling method, three heuristic methods which are utilizing dynamic event features, history information and machine assignment rules are incorporated in the population initialization. Here, we will investigate the influence of each method on the performance of e-MOEA. The comparison method in the dynamic job shop is similar to that used in Section 5.3.2. Average performances, effect size of Cohen's d, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests of different initialization methods across rescheduling points are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">11</ref>, where Proposed_Ini is the e-MOEA-based method using the initialization strategy proposed in this paper.</p><p>The other four methods are similar to Proposed_Ini, except that Norepair_Ini and Nohistory_Ini do not make use of the dynamic event characteristics and the history information, respectively. Norepair_nohistory_Ini only employs the machine assignment rules and random individuals. There is no heuristic method in Random_Ini, and all the initial individuals are generated at random which regenerates a new schedule from scratch.</p><p>In terms of convergence, Proposed_Ini achieves the best average performances (mean and std. value in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">11</ref>(a)) on HVR and GD. According to <ref type="bibr">Table 11(b)</ref>, although GD values of Proposed_Ini, Norepair_Ini and Nohistory_Ini are not significantly different, Proposed_Ini is significantly better than Norepair_nohistory_Ini on HVR and GD, and also significantly better than Norepair_Ini on HVR, which indicates that the combined use of the dynamic characteristics and history information in initialization can help improve the convergence performance of the e-MOEA-based rescheduling method a lot. It can be found that Norepair_nohistory_Ini is significantly better than Random_Ini on both HVR and GD, which shows that incorporating the machine assignment rules in initialization is also helpful in improving the convergence. Moreover, the effect sizes of Proposed_Ini vs. Random_Ini on HVR and GD are larger than that of Norepair_nohistory_Ini vs. Random_Ini, which further validates the effectiveness of making use of dynamic characteristics and history information.</p><p>With respect to distributions of non-dominated solutions, there is no significant difference among the five initialization methods for Spacing. For Spread, Norepair_nohistory_Ini achieves the best performance, which demonstrates that employing machine assignment rules in initialization can help improve the spread performance, but the incorporation of dynamic characteristics and history information may deteriorate the spread a little. The reason is that Proposed_Ini uses the history solution, the schedule repair solution and their variants as parts of the initial population, which can help speed the Overall, by making use of the dynamic event features, history information and machine assignment rules, the proposed heuristic initialization method at each rescheduling point can make e-MOEA adapt to the new environment quickly and find the solution to the new problem efficiently, since compared to the random initialization, it is very effective in improving the convergence performance of e-MOEA, and it can also maintain a good distribution of non-dominated solutions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper proposed an MOEA-based rescheduling method to regenerate new schedules in respond to random events in dynamic flexible job shops. Our first contribution is the construction of a dynamic multi-objective optimization model for MODFJSSP. In the model, considering the updated job shop state at each rescheduling point, four objectives with respect to both the shop efficiency and stability are optimized simultaneously. In addition, six categories of constraints to the search space which change dynamically with the occurrences of real-time events are addressed, and a more sophisticated definition for stability is presented.</p><p>Our second contribution is an e-MOEA-based predictive-reactive scheduling method. The novelty is the employment of heuristic strategies in population initialization so that the method does not regenerate a new schedule from scratch at each rescheduling point. In addition, the proposed method can deal with multiple scheduling policies (operation sequencing and machine assignment) simultaneously as a result of individual representations and two kinds of problem specific variation operators. Experimental results show that our e-MOEA-based method can achieve much better performances on total make-span and tardiness than combinations of popular dispatching rules with machine assignment rules. Three MOEAbased rescheduling methods (e-MOEA, NSGA-II and SPEA2) are compared. Results in both static and dynamic flexible job shops show that e-MOEA is the most competitive approach for evolving efficient non-dominated solutions for MODFJSSP.</p><p>Statistical tests indicate that it has the best overall performances across rescheduling points in dynamic environments.</p><p>Moreover, its computational cost is much less than NSGA-II and SPEA2. In addition, Pareto front obtained at each rescheduling point provides much better knowledge about various trade-offs in the objective space for the DM to make an informed decision, which cannot be achieved by combinations of existing scheduling rules or by the methods using a weighted sum approach. Further analyses show that introduction of the stability objective can improve the system stability much more than it degrades efficiency, and heuristic initialization strategies are very effective in improving the convergence of the e-MOEA-based method.</p><p>Our third contribution is the design of a dynamic decision making procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can select a solution which corresponds to the DM's preferences from the trade-off solution set generated at each rescheduling point. As future work, the proposed MOEA-based rescheduling methods should be applied to more job shop conditions, e.g. different levels of job arrival rates, and other kinds of job shop scenarios with more dynamic events such as variations of processing times. Moreover, other constraints in the real-world job shop must be added, e.g. sequence dependent setup time. Evolution of other scheduling policies such as due-date assignment will also be considered.  Processing times of the new arrival jobs are shown in Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.9 (due to the space limitation, only the processing times of the first three out of the 1230 new jobs are given).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.

Performance comparisons in the initial 10 Â 10 static FJSSP. At the initial time t 0 = 0, there were totally 50 operations from 10 jobs to be processed on 10 machines (data is provided in Appendix A). Three objectives of make-span, tardiness and maximal machine workload were to be optimized. 30 independent runs of each MOEA were performed, and the generated Pareto fronts of each run were recorded for statistical tests. The performance indicators of three MOEA-based methods are shown in Fig. 7. All the objective values of Pareto fronts obtained by each algorithm were normalized by the maximum and minimum value found on the corresponding objective.</figDesc></figure>
