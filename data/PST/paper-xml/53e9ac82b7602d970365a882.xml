<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One class of applications envisaged for the IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN (low data rate-wireless personal area network) standard is wireless sensor networks for monitoring and control applications. In this paper we provide an analytical performance model for a network in which the sensors are at the tips of a star topology, and the sensors need to transmit their measurements to the hub node so that certain objectives for packet delay and packet discard are met. We first carry out a saturation throughput analysis of the system; i.e., it is assumed that each sensor has an infinite backlog of packets and the throughput of the system is sought. After a careful analysis of the CSMA/CA MAC that is employed in the standard, and after making a certain decoupling approximation, we identify an embedded Markov renewal process, whose analysis yields a fixed point equation, from whose solution the saturation throughput can be calculated. We validate our model against ns2 simulations (using an IEEE 802.15.4 module developed by Zheng <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>). We find that with the default back-off parameters the saturation throughput decreases sharply with increasing number of nodes. We use our analytical model to study the problem and we propose alternative back-off parameters that prevent the drop in throughput. We then show how the saturation analysis can be used to obtain an analytical model for the finite arrival rate case. This finite load model captures very well the qualitative behavior of the system, and also provides a good approximation to the packet discard probability, and the throughput. For the default parameters, the finite load throughput is found to first increase and then decrease with increasing load. We find that for typical performance objectives (mean delay and packet discard) the packet discard probability would constrain the system capacity. Finally, we show how to derive a node lifetime analysis using various rates and probabilities obtained from our performance analysis model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Low rate-wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) are designed to serve a variety of applications with a focus on enabling wireless sensor networks. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has evolved to realize the physical (PHY) and multiple access control (MAC) layers of such LR-WPANS. The ZigBee alliance has developed the network and upper layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The overall objective of our work reported here is to analyse the performance of such networks for industrial sensing and measurement applications. The aim is to replace existing wired sensor networks (based, e.g., on the Fieldbus standard) with wireless ad hoc sensor networks. The end to end applications, however, will initially remain unchanged. Hence the concern is whether the wireless network will be able to carry the measurement traffic with the same level of performance as the wired network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Preview of contributions</head><p>In this paper we provide the results of our analysis of a star topology sensor network based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Here we limit our work to the situation in which packets flow only from the sensors to the head of the hub of the star (i.e., the PAN coordinator). We first obtain the saturation throughput of the network. Then we provide some results on performance with finite rate arrivals of measurements. The following is a preview of our main contributions and findings.</p><p>(1) We provide a fixed point analysis, using a decoupling approximation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) for the saturation throughput analysis of IEEE 802.15.4 networks. The CSMA/CA mechanism in IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref>.4 is significantly different from that in IEEE 802.11, for which the analyses in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> were done. Hence a major novelty in our present work is that we extract a Markov renewal process model for the evolution of the CSMA/CA channel in IEEE 802.15.4, and then develop a decoupling approximation for this model. We find that our analysis captures the saturation throughput with a maximum error of 5% (see Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>). ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) We find that the design of the CSMA/CA MAC in IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref>.4 is such that the aggregate saturation throughput decreases sharply with the number of nodes. We use our analytical model to show that with the default parameters, with increasing number of nodes the backoff adaptation does not work well and the network operates in a congested regime. We show that, staying within the framework of the standard, it is possible to modify the backoff parameters so that the saturation throughput decreases only slightly when the number of nodes increases. It is also found that packet discard probability is much reduced after these modifications (see Figs. <ref type="figure">18</ref> and<ref type="figure">19</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> The saturation analysis thus obtained is used to perform a heuristic finite load analysis. Simulations show that the analysis captures very well the qualitative behavior of delay, throughput, and packet discard probabilities, and for the latter two also provides a good analytical approximation (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">21</ref> and<ref type="figure">22</ref>). (4) Finally, we show how a node lifetime analysis can be performed by using the various event rates and probabilities derived from our performance analysis model (see Fig. <ref type="figure">23</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Related literature</head><p>Zheng and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> have given an overview of the standard. Kinney <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> has provided a description of ZigBee technology, along with a comparative study of ZigBee with Bluetooth. There have been several simulation studies of the IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA mechanism. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Zheng and Lee report on a module that they have developed for the ns2 simulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and provide results from several sets of simulation experiments. Other simulations studies have been reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Timmons and Scanlon have done the very first analytical modeling of the IEEE 802.15.4 single cell network in the context of medical sensor body area networks. Their much simplified analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> focuses on long-term power consumption of devices. Park et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Pollin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and Tao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> propose Markov chain models to analyse the performance of the 802.15.4 slotted CSMA/CA protocol in the saturation condition. The analytical approach is similar to that introduced by Bianchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for analysing the IEEE 802.11 DCF with saturated nodes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the authors assume that times at which channel activity starts are renewal instants, and develop a 3-dimensional Markov chain for the joint evolution of a node's back-offs and the residual time within a channel cycle. This yields a complex Markov chain, whose transition probabilities are expressed in terms of an unknown vector of probabilities. Finally, after some assumptions the analysis involves the solution of a vector fixed point equation in this unknown vector of probabilities. One assumption that is made is that the number of nodes that can attempt at any time is always n, the total number of nodes. Also, only saturation analysis is performed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Ramachandran et al. model the contention access period specified in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard using nonpersistent CSMA as the access mechanism. The authors show that reducing the number of CCAs to 1 is advantageous in terms of achievable throughput and delay in situations where a MAC layer acknowledgment is not required. The analysis is also based on a Markov chain model for the behavior of each node, but is limiting since no buffering at the nodes is considered. The authors replace the uniform distribution of backoff window size with a geometric distribution of the same mean. The possibility of collisions is ignored while formulating the Markov chain model of a tagged node. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> the authors consider a beacon enabled star topology network with bidirectional traffic. Each node is modeled as an M/G/1 queue and then a Markov model like the one developed by Bianchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is obtained. Kohvakka et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> provide a simplified analysis of a cluster tree topology of IEEE 802.15.4 sensor nodes. Leibnitz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> report the analysis of IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA when all nodes initiate their transmission attempts simultaneosly. Thus these authors do not consider any particular traffic model. Koubaa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, discuss the inefficiencies of the CFP and GTS mechanisms of IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The authors then propose an implicit GTS allocation mechanism (i-GAME) to address the problems observed. Ramachandran <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> has reported a comprehensive list of bugs in the existing ns2 implementation of 802.15.4.</p><p>In our work we have followed an approach along the lines of Kumar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We first obtain a saturation analysis in which each node is characterized by a single unknown attempt probability, which is obtained by the solution of a fixed point equation. Then a finite load analysis is obtained by a novel application of the saturation analysis. Overall the analysis is simpler than the one based on detailed per node Markov chains and provides better insight. Also we compare our results against the more standard ns2 simulator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Outline of the paper</head><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews LR-WPAN architecture and its specifications. In Sect. 3 we identify various scenarios that occur when nodes interact using the IEEE 802.15.4 slotted CSMA/CA MAC. In Sect. 5, we identify a cyclic evolution of system behavior, provide a stochastic model of the evolution of certain processes, and also formulate a fixed point equation. Various performance measures are derived in Sect. 6. Numerical results along with a discussion are also provided in the same chapter. In Sect. 7.2, we discuss how back-off parameters can be changed to modify network performance. In Sect. 7 we use the saturation analysis to develop a finite load analysis. In Sect. 9 we show how our model can be used to derive an estimate of node lifetime. Finally, Sect. 10 we summarise the insights gained from our work in this paper. The appendix contains the details of the derivations of various transition probabilities and conditional distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">IEEE 802.15.4: A short overview and scope of our modeling</head><p>We begin by providing a quick overview of the parts of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC standard that are relevant to our study. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a star topology sensor network comprising a PAN coordinator and several sensors as leaf nodes. Since we consider only a simple star topology, with flow of traffic only from the leaf nodes to the hub, we need to consider only the PHY and MAC standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">PHY and MAC overview</head><p>Throughout we assume that we are working in the We now turn to the MAC specifications. The IEEE 802.15.4 can operate either in a beacon enabled or a nonbeacon enabled mode. In the beacon enabled mode, the PAN coordinator works with time slots defined through a superframe structure (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This permits a synchronous operation of the network so that nodes can go to sleep and wake up at designated times. We assume this mode in our work. Each superframe has active and inactive portions. The PAN Coordinator interacts with the network only during the active portion. The active portion is composed of three parts: a beacon, a contention access period (CAP), and a contention free period (CFP). The active portion starts with the transmission of a beacon and a CAP commences immediately after the beacon. All frames, except acknowledgment frames and any data frame that immediately follows the acknowledgment of a data request command (as would happen following a data request from a node to the PAN coordinator), transmitted in the CAP, must use a slotted CSMA/CA mechanism to access the channel. We note that we do not model data requests from nodes to the PAN coordinator in our work reported here.</p><p>The CFP, if present, follows immediately after the CAP and extends up to the end of the active portion of the superframe (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). To use a CFP, a node issues an explicit GTS (guaranteed time slot) allocation request to the PAN coordinator. The PAN coordinator, can allocate available GTSs to nodes. In the CFP, a device can transmit during its GTS, without any contention with other devices. We note that, as per the standard, the PAN coordinator may allocate only up to seven GTSs in a CFP. Hence, no more than seven nodes can be involved in the CFP during a superframe. It follows that in a network with a large number of nodes this feature will be useful only for sporadic alarm traffic that requires very low latency. See also Device Coordinator PAN Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> A star topology LR-WPAN sensor network Wireless Netw (2008) 14:543-568 545 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for an additional discussion of the limitations of the GTS mechanism. Transmitted frames are always followed by an IFS period. Frames(MPDUs) of length up to aMaxSIFSFram-eSize are followed by a SIFS period of duration of at least aMinSIFSPeriod symbols, otherwise a LIFS of a duration at least aMinLIFSPeriod symbols follows (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Scope of our analytical model</head><p>We consider a beacon enabled star topology network, in which all the communication is from the sensors to the PAN coordinator. Thus we do not consider peer-to-peer communication, nor do we consider mesh topologies. We only model the slotted CSMA/CA MAC, and not unslotted CSMA/CA.</p><p>Since we are interested in an application in which measurements continuously flow from the sensors to the PAN coordinator, it is assumed that the active part of the superframe is equal to the beacon interval. For such traffic the time reserved in the CFP part of a superframe will often be wasted. Thus, no CFPs are assumed. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> Since we focus on analyzing the performance of slotted CSMA/CA, we assume a large superframe duration. This allows us to ignore the beacon transmission time and all the time wasted at the end of each beacon interval due to nodes not being able to complete their transmissions in the fragment of time left at the end of a beacon interval. Thus all of channel time is assumed to be used for CSMA/CA based access.</p><p>Since we are analyzing the star topology, which has only one hop transmissions, the ZigBee routing algorithm does not come into the picture. It is also assumed that none of the devices disassociates during the whole traffic flow, and also that communication failures never cause a device to conclude that it has been orphaned.</p><p>We assume also that all nodes are perfectly synchronized at backoff period boundaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The slotted CSMA/CA algorithm</head><p>The CSMA/CA algorithm is implemented using units of time, called backoff periods, each of length aUnitBack-offPeriod (=20 symbol times = 0.32 ms). Note that 10 bytes can be transmitted in one backoff period. In slotted CSMA/CA, the backoff period boundaries of every device in the PAN are aligned with the superframe slot boundaries of the PAN coordinator, and transmissions begin on the boundary of a backoff period.</p><p>Each device maintains three variables for each transmission attempt: NB, CW and BE. NB is initialised to 0, and counts the number of additional backoffs the algorithm has to do while attempting the current transmission. CW is the number of backoff periods, that need to be clear of channel activity before the transmission can commence. MAC ensures this by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) at the boundary of CW consecutive backoff periods <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> . CW is set to 2 before each transmission attempt, i.e., two consecutive CCAs must find the channel clear in order for the node to attempt a transmission. BE is the backoff exponent and is initialized to macMinBE. If a node  If the node can proceed, it transmits the packet. This may result either in a successful transmission or a collision. A successful transmission is always accompanied by the reception of a MAC acknowledgment. A MAC acknowledgment is of fixed length, 11 bytes. The transmitting node always waits for acknowledgment for macAckWaitDuration before declaring a collision. If the packet collides with some other packet while being transmitted, it is retransmitted with all backoff parameters set to their initial values. A packet is retransmitted at most aMaxFrameRetries times after transmission failures due to collisions, before being discarded.</p><p>CSMA/CA employs one more parameter mac-BattLifeExt to exploit the possibility of energy savings at the PAN coordinator in case of very low duty-cycle traffic. In slotted systems with macBattLifeExt set to TRUE, the backoff countdown only occurs during the first mac-BattLifeExtPeriods full backoff periods following the beacon's IFS period and subsequent frame transmissions to the PAN Coordinator are required to start in this duration. So if the PHY at the PAN Coordinator does not indicate any reception during this period, the PAN Coordinator can go into a doze mode, thus saving its battery energy. If macBattLifeExt is set to TRUE, the backoff exponent BE is initialized to the smaller of 2 and macMinBE; otherwise BE is initialised to macMinBE.</p><p>The CSMA/CA algorithm analysed in this paper assumes macBattLifeExt set to FALSE, so that backoff countdown can occur throughout the active portion of the superframe and the frame transmission also can start at any of the backoff period boundaries throughout the active portion of the superframe.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is written with an implementer in mind. It describes the behavior of an individual node. In order to model the system, however, we need to understand how nodes interact. In this section we will identify the various scenarios that arise when the nodes interact. This will reveal a certain cyclical evolution of the aggregate behavior of the nodes, which will lead to the mathematical model that we will develop in Sect. 5.</p><p>Whenever a node has a packet to transmit, it starts a random backoff. Once the backoff is completed, the node seeks a reservation of the channel. For that purpose, following the backoff, it performs a CCA, at the start of the next backoff period, to see whether the channel is free. A CCA lasts for 8 symbol times and the CCA status, either success or failure, is revealed at the end of the 8th symbol time. This is because if the channel is declared to be free even at the end of the 8th symbol time, the node can turn its transmitter on within the remaining 12 symbol times and can begin a new transmission at the start boundary of the next backoff period. The actual CCA algorithm involves integrating the observed signal energy over some window, and the result of a CCA is highly dependent on the window, the number of nodes transmitting and their proximity to the node performing the CCA. Hence, in order to facilitate our analysis, we make the simplifying assumption that if any channel activity (successful transmission or collision) finishes before the end of the 8th symbol time in a backoff period, the channel appears to be virtually free from the point of view of all the nodes not involved in the activity. This can be expected to provide a higher chance of CCA success, hence leading to optimistic results.</p><p>In case the first CCA succeeds, the node waits until the start of the next backoff slot and performs one more CCA. If the channel is again found to be free, the node starts transmission at the start of the next backoff period boundary. The reason for using two CCAs becomes clear from the remaining discussion in this subsection.</p><p>A successful transmission is always accompanied by reception of a MAC acknowledgment of length 11 bytes (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, where the last byte of the ACK is shown spilling over into the second backoff period). Once a node finishes reception of data, it needs a time t ack (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) before its transmitter is turned on, and then it starts transmission of the MAC ACK. Since, transmission of an ACK can start at a backoff period boundary only, t ack can have values in the range: aTurnaroundTime ¬£ t ack ¬£ aTurn aroundTime + aUnitBackoffPeriod. The whole transaction also includes an interframe space time after transmission of the MAC acknowledgment (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>In case data transmission finishes before the end of the 8th symbol time in its last backoff period, the receiver can turn its transmitter on (during the remaining 12 symbol times) before the start of the next backoff period and, hence, it can start the transmission of the ACK at the next backoff period boundary. But if data requires more than 8 symbol times in its last backoff period, the receiver has less then 12 symbol times in that backoff period and hence the turn around time spills over into the next backoff period. So, the ACK has to wait one more entire backoff period. In either case the channel becomes virtually free for exactly one backoff period. Denote that backoff period by t ack √É . Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows these situations.</p><p>There will be a collision only if two or more nodes start their first CCA (in the sequence of two CCAs) at the same backoff boundary. A transmitting node always waits for acknowledgment for macAckWaitDuration before declaring a collision. This is the worst case delay which can occur in reception of acknowledgment. Denote the ACK transmission time by T ack . Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">macAckWaitDuration ¬º max√∞t ack √û √æ T ack ¬º aTurnaround Time √æ aUnitBackoffPeriod √æ T ack .</formula><p>This situation is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, where nodes 1 and 2 are shown to collide.</p><p>While a node performs CCAs, if some activity is going on and the channel is not virtually free, its first CCA itself will fail. This possibility is shown through Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, when a node starts a CCA, if the channel is either in second CCA (CCA 2) or in t ack √É due to some node, then the first CCA (CCA 1) from the node will succeed, but this node's CCA 2 will fail. Figures <ref type="figure">8</ref> and<ref type="figure">9</ref> show the situations where the first CCA succeeds while the second fails for Node 2. This explains why two CCAs are needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Observations about the IEEE 802.15.ns2 module</head><p>A detailed look at IEEE 802.15.4 ns2 module <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> revealed that there are a few inconsistencies between the module and the IEEE 802.15.4 standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We made changes in the module to address the following discrepancies, which are relevant to our work.</p><p>(1) A node performing CCA decides whether the CCA has succeeded only at the end of the 8th symbol time in a backoff period. Once the second CCA succeeds, the remaining 12 symbol times (which is equal to aTurnaroundTime) left in that backoff period are sufficient for the node to turn its transmitter on. In the ns2 module, a node spends one extra backoff period before starting actual transmission, whenever its second CCA succeeds. (2) Whenever a node's frame collides, the attempt counter is increased by one until the counter exceeds aMaxFrameRetries, after which the frame is discarded. Unlike the standard, in the ns2 module a node resets this counter when the attempt process of a packet spills over into a new superframe. (3) In case a channel access failure occurs while attempting for a packet, the packet should be discarded. But in the ns2 module a packet is reattempted indefinitely often after channel access failures, and is discarded only if it faces more than aMaxFrameRetries collisions.</p><p>5 The stochastic model and a fixed point equation</p></div>

All node activities are initiated at backoff period boundaries. We need to study each node's individual behavior and also the aggregate channel activity.</p><p>From the point of view of the channel activity, we can define certain cycles (see the last time line in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>).</p><p>There could be a succession of idle backoff periods. An idle channel period ends when both of the successive CCAs of one or more nodes are successful. Once this happens, the channel activity in the following cycle can evolve in one of two ways: i.e., subsequently there may be a successful transmission (as in case of Node 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>), or a collision between two or more nodes (like Nodes 2 and 3 in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>).</p><p>Suppose the network consist of n contending nodes, excluding the PAN coordinator. The length of a cycle depends on the number of nodes available to attempt in the first backoff period of the cycle. A cycle contains a single idle backoff period of length d, if none of the available nodes attempts to sense the channel at the start boundary of this backoff period (see Cycle 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>). It leaves all those nodes free to attempt in the next cycle.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> we show a successful transmission cycle. Let us examine this carefully. The total busy period of the transaction is shown as T data-ack . Acknowledgments always start at the boundary of a backoff period and being of fixed length 11 bytes (i.e., 22 symbols) consume only 2 symbol times in their last backoff period. Thus, at the start boundary of this backoff period, the channel becomes virtually free for other nodes because a CCA that starts at this backoff period boundary (being of 8 symbol times duration) will find the channel clear, and hence a new cycle might be started by other nodes in this backoff period. Thus, T data-ack does not include this backoff period. Define T data√Äack √É as the portion of T data-ack , excluding t ack √É (recalling t ack √É from Sect. 3) i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T data√Äack √É ¬º T data√Äack √Ä t ack √É</formula><p>It is seen that, a cycle of successful transmission lasts for T data-ack + 2d duration and, only n -1 nodes are available for attempt in the following backoff period. Note from In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">12</ref> we depict a collision cycle. If there are 2 or more nodes available to attempt at the beginning of a cycle, there is a possibility of collision. If there is a collision of k nodes, it continues for T coll duration. During its last backoff period, if a collision consumes less than or equal to 8 symbol times, again the channel becomes virtually free from the point of view of nodes not involved in collision; then, this backoff period is not included in T coll . After the collision, all the k senders wait for acknowledgment for macAckWaitDuration before realising that there is a transmission failure. Define a positive integer J such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">J √æ 1 ¬º &amp; T coll √æ macAckWaitDuration d ' √æ 2 √Ä T coll d</formula><p>where T coll is the actual time spent in collision by a node.

Thus a cycle containing a collision activity has one of the following three possibilities.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Case 1: k &lt; n, and one or more of the n-k nodes not involved in the collision perform successful CCAs, while k nodes involved in collision are still waiting for acknowledgments. In this case the length of the current cycle will be T coll + jd,j 2{2,3,..J} with, n-k nodes being available to contend for next cycle. Also the next cycle cannot be an idle cycle. ‚Ä¢ Case 2: k &lt; n, and all the k nodes involved in the collision finish with their macAckWaitDurations and none of the other n-k nodes attempts for a CCA in this duration. In this case the length of the current cycle will be T coll + (J + 1)d, and all the n nodes will be available to contend for next cycle. ‚Ä¢ Case 3: k = n. There will not be any node available to attempt after the collision is over. The current cycle will last for T coll + (J + 1)d duration, and all the n nodes will be available to contend for next cycle.</p><p>These situations are illustrated by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">12</ref>, which corresponds to J = 4. Here the current cycle may be of lengths T coll + (i + 1)d, i = 1,2,3, provided that some of the nodes other than 1 or 2, attempt at the ith backoff period boundary after the collision is over. The cycle length will be T coll + 5d if none of other nodes attempt while nodes 1 and 2 are waiting for acknowledgments. The figure shows the case where the cycle length is T coll + 4d. In Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> the channel enters into Cycle 4, while Nodes 2 and 3 are still waiting for acknowledgments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">A decoupling approximation</head><p>Motivated by the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we propose a decoupling approximation in order to analyse the above process. In this section we provide an outline of our approach. Each node alternates between periods when it performs backoffs and unsuccessful CCAs and periods when it transmits (successfully or unsuccessfully). Let b denote the rate at which a node's backoffs complete during the time when it is performing backoffs; i.e., b is a rate conditioned on times during which the node is performing back-offs. Unlike the IEEE 802.11 DCF mechanism, here nodes do not freeze their backoff timers when there is activity on the channel. So, it is not possible to work with ''conditional time'' as is done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to facilitate the fixed point analysis for 802.11 WLANs. Instead we proceed as follows. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>, the channel evolves over cycles. At the end of each cycle we need to determine the activity in the next cycle. The nodes that can attempt in the next cycle are in their backoff periods. We assume that each such node attempts independently in a slot with probability b. Thus, if k nodes can potentially attempt at a backoff period boundary, then we assume that the number of attempts is binomially distributed with parameters k and b. With this assumption, the transitions probabilities of the Markov renewal process, and the conditional expectations defined in Sect. 5.2 can be written down. The detailed derivation of the transitions probabilities and conditional distributions are provided in the Appendix. This approach permits us to obtain channel event rates in terms of the unknown value b.</p><p>In order to obtain b, we separate out a typical (''tagged'') node and analyse it while viewing the other nodes as an environment. We can express b in terms of certain channel activity measures of other nodes. It is shown in Sect. 5.4 that there is a function</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">G(√Å, √Å, √Å) such that b ¬º G√∞a; a data√Äack √É ; a coll √û</formula><p>where a is the probability that the tagged node's CCA fails, a data√Äack √É is the probability that the tagged node finds one of the other nodes in a successful transmission, and a coll is the probability that the tagged node finds some of the other nodes in a collision. In the overall analysis procedure, we can call the above equation a typical node's response equation, with the various probabilities capturing the influence of the environment on the tagged node. Each of these probabilities are obtained as a certain fraction of time that the other n -1 nodes (i.e., the environment in relation to the tagged node) are in certain states. For example, a coll is the fraction of time that the other n -1 nodes are in a collision. In order to obtain these probabilities we proceed as follows: (i) It is assumed that each node in the environment also behaves like the tagged node, and hence attempts during its back-off periods at the rate b, and (ii) then we obtain the desired fractions of times by assuming that when several nodes are performing back-offs they attempt independently, each with probability b. This latter approximation is exactly the kind of approximation in other fixed point based analyses such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This yields equations that can be called the coupling equations.</p><p>In order to obtain the coupling equations, we obtain the probabilities of various events occurring when each of the n-1 nodes (that comprise the tagged node's environment) uses the (unknown) attempt rate b. The channel evolves over cycles as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>. Using the Markov regenerative analysis described in Sect. 5.2 we find the fraction of time occupied by certain events (e.g., a collision). As per the decoupling approximation, we assume that the tagged node see the events with this probability. Thus channel activity measures seen by the tagged node can be determined in terms of b, e.g., a = H(n -1, b), a coll = H coll (n -1, b), etc., where the H ... (√Å, √Å) functions are shown in Sect. 5.4. This yields b in terms of the activity measures of the environment, and vice versa. This gives the following fixed point equation.</p><p>b ¬º G√∞H√∞n √Ä 1; b√û; H data√Äack √É √∞n √Ä 1; b√û; H coll √∞n √Ä 1; b√û√û The fixed point equation yields b, which can then be used to obtain the aggregate saturation throughput of the network. The details are developed in Sect. 5.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">A fixed point equation for b</head><p>Let us tag a node and obtain its b. A CCA from the tagged node will fail if it finds the channel either in second CCA, T data-ack (see Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>) or T coll (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">12</ref>). Let a CCA2 , a data-ack and a coll be the probabilities of the channel being in second CCA, T data-ack or T coll respectively. Then considering each of these as an event e, we can use the analysis in Sect. 5.2 to obtain their time rates. Noting that once we have tagged a node we need to find the above probabilities for the other n -1 nodes, the desired probabilities are given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">a CCA2 ¬º P n√Ä1 k¬º1 p k E k R √∞CCA2√û P n√Ä1 k¬º1 p k E k U ¬º: H CCA2 √∞n √Ä 1; b√û a data√Äack ¬º P n√Ä1 k¬º1 p k E k R √∞data√Äack√û P n√Ä1 k¬º1 p k E k U ¬º: H data√Äack √∞n √Ä 1; b√û a coll ¬º P n√Ä1 k¬º1 p k E k R √∞coll√û P n√Ä1 k¬º1 p k E k U ¬º: H coll √∞n √Ä 1; b√û</formula><p>Note that the right hand sides of the above three equations depend on b.

Also let a data√Äack √É and a t ack √É be the fractions of time, the channel is in T data√Äack √É and t ack √É respectively. These quantities can also be calculated as functions of b, in the way shown above.

Recall that all the nodes have saturated queues. A node goes through the backoff procedure for its head-of-the-line (HOL) packet. Each such backoff procedure can end in one of three ways: successful transmission, collision, or a channel access failure (i.e., none of the CCAs during the backoff procedure succeeds). If there is a success, a fresh backoff procedure is begun for the next packet. If there is a collision, a fresh backoff procedure is begun for the same packet and the packet is discarded after N collisions (N = 4 in the standard, as 3 retries are allowed). Upon the discard of a packet a fresh backoff procedure is begun for the next packet. Finally, if there is a channel access failure for a packet, the packet is discarded, and the next packet moves to the HOL position. We seek b, the rate at which backoffs complete during times when the tagged node is performing backoffs, given the various probabilities for the other n -1 nodes, as obtained above. Let us denote K = the number of times channel sensing is reattempted in a backoff cycle b k = the mean backoff duration (in backoff periods) before the (k + 1)th channel sensing attempt for a packet, 0 ¬£ k ¬£ K</p><p>It must be noted that during a backoff procedure, each backoff will be followed by one or possibly two CCA durations before the next backoff starts following a CCA failure.</p><p>Suppose, A √∞k√û j denotes the number of attempts for the jth backoff procedure after the kth backoff failure.

Zheng <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. We have used the source code released on January 1, 2005, with modifications as discussed in Sect. 4. Static routing is implemented by using NOAH as the wireless routing agent. This allows us to ensure that multihop wireless routing is not used. We work in the 2.45 GHz band, with the PHY data rate 250 kbps. The simulation scenario consists of n nodes distributed uniformly around a circle of radius 8 m, with the PAN coordinator at the center. The decoding and the sensing range thresholds of the nodes are set to 20 m, so that all nodes form a single cell. Nodes start associating with the PAN coordinator one by one at regular intervals of 0.5 s. After 5.0 s of the last node having started association, CBR traffic is initiated simultaneously from all the nodes. The CBR packet size is kept as 10 bytes to which 20 bytes of IP header, 7 bytes of MAC header and 6 bytes of PHY header are added. To ensure saturation, the CBR traffic interval is kept very small; each node's buffer receives packets at intervals of 5 ms. Where the throughput results are in bytes/s, and represent the throughput of the MAC payload.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Results and observations</head><p>The conditional attempt rates per node, b, aggregate throughputs, Q (packets per second), and discard probabilities, P discard , obtained through simulation are compared against the analytical results in Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>, where 95% confidence intervals are also shown for the simulation results. We make the following observations:</p><p>‚Ä¢ It can be seen that, even after many modeling simplifications, the fixed point analysis provides an excellent approximation, for a wide range of the number of nodes, n. ‚Ä¢ The results show that b decreases until n = 10 and then remains almost constant with increasing n, while the aggregate throughput increases initially but then decreases very sharply with increasing n. The slight increase in Q with n is because for small n the contention is less and increasing n increases the channel utilisation. ‚Ä¢ The discard probability increases rapidly as the number of nodes increases and approaches approximately 1 as the number of nodes is increased up to 50.</p><p>We will see later that finite load performance is substantially better, and, in fact, derivable from the saturation performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Discussion of default backoff parameters</head><p>If the expression for Q(√Å) in Sect. 6.1 is evaluated with b as a free variable, for various values of b and n, then we obtain the plots in Fig. <ref type="figure">17</ref>; note that here Q is given in kbps (60 kbps = 250 packets per second). For n ‚Ä° 10, the values of b for which the aggregate throughput Q peaks are much less than those obtained for the actual system for the default parameters (about 0.09; see Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">17 also</ref> shows that once a node exceeds these attempt rates its throughput starts decreasing as the attempt rate increases. This is the region, in which the network operates with the current set of backoff parameters (b = 0.09, see Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">17</ref> shows that in this regime of operation, to maintain a constant throughput as n increases, b must decrease sharply with n; this does not occur with the given backoff parameters.</p><p>It is also observed from Fig. <ref type="figure">17</ref> that the same throughputs can be obtained with much smaller attempt rates, while working in a region where throughput increases with attempt rate for a fixed number of nodes. The attempt rates, collision probabilities and hence energy expenditure is much less in this region. This also leads to lower discard probabilities. It is also seen that the attempt rate need not decrease significantly in this region to maintain a constant throughput with increasing number of nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Performance with alternate backoff parameters</head><p>We find that simple changes in the backoff parameters can lead us to operate in the desired region. Figures <ref type="figure">18</ref> and<ref type="figure">19</ref> show the results for two ways of altering the backoff parameters: (i) increasing the backoff multiplier to 3, and (ii) changing macMinBE to 5 and aMaxBE to 7. Figure <ref type="figure">18</ref> shows the attempt rate, throughput and discard probability plots after we have increased the backoff multiplier from 2 to 3. Figure <ref type="figure">19</ref> is for the case when macMinBE and aMaxBE have been changed to 5 and 7 respectively. These plots show that, with a slight change of a few backoff  parameters we are able to maintain constant throughput with increasing number of nodes. Discard probabilities are also substantially smaller. The large initial backoffs cause less contention in the case of a large number of nodes, but on the other hand lead to unnecessary wastage of channel time when number of nodes is small. Hence, we get worse throughputs as compared to those with default parameters for small number of nodes (see Figs. <ref type="figure">18</ref> and<ref type="figure">19</ref>). Thus it becomes interesting to consider the possibility of adapting the backoff parameters depending on the number of nodes n, in an attempt to achieve an attempt rate that yields the peak saturation throughput for each n (see Fig. <ref type="figure">17</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Analysis with finite arrival rates</head><p>Each sensor node receives (generates) packets that have to be delivered to the hub node. We assume that the rate of ''arrival'' of packets at each sensor node is k and the arrival processes are independent and Poisson. Note that while a Poisson arrival model would not be appropriate in a regular wireless network that handles packet voice or TCP controlled data, here in a sensor networking context the arrivals are ''open loop,'' and a Poisson process may be a reasonable model for the occurrence of asynchronous events. Define L = nk. Let q denote the fraction of time a sensor node's queue is nonempty and hence the node is contending for the channel. As before, Q(n) and D(n) are the aggregate throughputs and discard rates for a network with n saturated nodes. We adopt an approach suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 4]</ref>. For fixed n, define l√∞n; q√û ¬º X n m¬º1 n m q m √∞1 √Ä q√û n√Äm √∞H√∞m√û √æ D√∞m√û√û and, m√∞n; q√û ¬º X n m¬º1 n m q m √∞1 √Ä q√û n√Äm H√∞m√û Thus, given q, l(q) is an approximation for the rate at which packets are being removed from the queue, either by successful transmission or discard. Similarly, m(q) is an approximation for the rate of successful transmission. It can be seen that lim q!1 l√∞n; q√û ¬º H√∞n√û √æ D√∞n√û, and lim q!1 m√∞n; q√û ¬º H√∞n√û:</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">20</ref> shows plots of l(q) vs. q and m(q) vs. q for several values of n. We see that l(q) monotonically increases with q, whereas m(q) first increases and then decreases with q. Hence, for each L &lt; Q(n) + D(n) there will be a unique q such that l(q) = L. We shall take this q to be the operating occupancy of a node corresponding to the arrival rate k packet per second into each node, i.e., for each n, we take q = l -1 (L). Now with the above approximation we can easily obtain various performance measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Aggregate throughput</head><p>The aggregate throughput of the network with n nodes can be obtained as U√∞n; K√û ¬º m√∞n; l √Ä1 √∞K√û√û Note that, for</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">L ‚Ä° Q(n) + D(n), F(n, L) = Q(n).</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">Discard probability</head><p>The discard probability is approximately Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref> l(q) (pkts/s) and m(q) (pkts/s) vs. q for n = 10, 20, 30 and 40 <ref type="bibr">Figures 21 and 22</ref> show the analytical as well as ns2 simulation results for 20 and 40 node networks, respectively. The plots show that the analysis is able to capture the trends of all the performance measures very well in all the cases, and the values q, Q, and P discard are approximated very well. The following observations can be made:</p><p>‚Ä¢ We notice that for small L the discard probability is small and the aggregate throughput, Q, increases with L, until Q peaks and then drops down to the saturation throughput (which can be read off, for each n, from Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>). Thus with finite load more throughput can be sustained than the saturation throughput. The reason for this can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>. Consider the 40 nodes case in Fig. <ref type="figure">22</ref>. The saturation throughput for 40 nodes, from Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>, is the same as the value to which Q drops in Fig. <ref type="figure">22</ref>, when L becomes large. When L is small, however, q is small, thus only a small number nodes contend at a time, and, as seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>, the throughput can be much larger. ‚Ä¢ Notice that, in both examples, as L increases q increases. Eventually q approaches 1, i.e., the nodes become saturated. At this point, for each value of n, 20 or 40, the values of Q, and P discard are the same as those shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>, as would be expected. ‚Ä¢ For measurement and control applications, it appears that the discard probability will determine the capacity. Consider, for example, Fig. <ref type="figure">22</ref>. If the target mean delay is 50 ms, then an arrival rate of L = 700 pkts/s can be sustained. However, this gives a discard probability greater than 50%! For a reasonable discard rate, the value of L can be no more than 200 pkts/s. ‚Ä¢ The mean delay approximation works well in the region of delay performance that the network would be engineered for. Thus the approximate analysis is adequate for practical network engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Node lifetime analysis</head><p>In this section, we use the analytical model developed earlier to estimate the lifetime of a sensor node in a star topology network. We assume that the PAN-coordinator is supplied line power; hence the power consumed by the PANcoordinator is not an issue. The network lifetime is determined by the lifetime of the leaf nodes, which are battery powered. We analyse the energy consumed by the RF transceiver in a node. The currents drawn by the other devices in a sensor node implementation are not considered, under the assumption that the communication component draws the predominantly larger current. We define the lifetime of a node as the expected lifetime assuming that the other nodes continue to work throughout the life of the node.</p></div>

We use the following information from the chipcon CC2240 data sheet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>:</p><p>‚Ä¢ The current drawn while a node is sleeping is I idle = 0.426 mA. ‚Ä¢ The current consumption of the chip in receive mode is a constant I rcv = 18.8 mA ‚Ä¢ The receiver sensitivity is -94 dBm. ‚Ä¢ The transmission power in the nodes can be programmed from -25 to 0 dBm in steps.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2">Time average current drawn by a node transceiver</head><p>Our analytical approach is to determine the time average current (in mA) drawn by a node, assuming that all the other nodes function indefinitely. Dividing the battery capacity (in mAh) by this time average current yields an estimate of the node lifetime. We will write the time average current in terms of the following quantities that can be derived from our earlier analysis (as we will show below). The number of nodes is fixed at n, and the aggregate arrival process is Poisson with L (equally distributed over the nodes); these parameters are implicit in the following notation. In the above notation, the probabilities with subscripts of the form f √Å√Å√Å refer to the fact that we are dealing the finite load case here. We find a fCCA1 , a f , a fdata√Äack √É and a fcoll as follows (where, as in Sect. 8, q is the fraction of time a node has nonempty queues, and hence is contending; and B√∞q; √∞n √Ä 1√û; m√û : where the argument (m) denotes the corresponding probabilities for the m node saturated case.

As explained earlier (see Sect. 5.4), when a node has packets, it can be viewed as going through cycles, each of which starts at the end of a node activity (success or collision) (see Fig. <ref type="figure">14</ref>). In a cycle there are several failed CCAs (and perhaps even dropped packets), followed by either a success, a collision. Denote by b f the attempt rate of a node (per backoff period) during the times when it is performing backoffs (here again the subscript f means that we are dealing with the finite load case). We compute b f as follows b f ¬º G√∞a f ; a fdata√Äack √É ; a fcoll √û where G√∞√Å; √Å; √Å√û is as defined in Sect. 5.4.

When the packet arrival rate is 0, the only power consumption is due to idle current, i.e., 0.426 mA. So the idle lifetime is 2000 mAh 0:426 mA ¬º 195:6 days. When the packet arrival rate increases, the current consumption increases, and the lifetime decreases to about 45 days with an arrival rate of 29 packets per second per node. Observe that the CCA sensing current and the collision current both increase with the arrival rate, whereas the current used in data transmission increases and then decreases. The decrease in the current used for data transmission relates to the behavior of m(q) shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref>; at higher arrival rates more packets get dropped and throughput decreases. Notice also that the average idle current decreases only slightly, indicating that the RF transceiver is active for only a small fraction of the time. Now turning to Fig. <ref type="figure">22</ref>, if for desired QoS the network is operated at 200 packets per second, or 5 packets per second per node, we have a node lifetime of about 148 days.</p></div>
