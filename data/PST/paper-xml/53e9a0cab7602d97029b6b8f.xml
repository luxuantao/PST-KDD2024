<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the last few years a remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of bond market phenomena. The main issues of the theory developed by a number</p><p>The financial support and hospitality of the University of Padua, the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge University, and the Stockholm School of Economics are gratefully acknowledged. Manuscript received: March 1996; final version received: October 1996 of researchers in tight cooperation with practitioners are the term structure of interest rates and the pricing of derivative securities (caps, floors, swaptions, etc.), see, e.g., books <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and references therein. The standard framework is that of continuous trading which is based on a stochastic calculus for semimartingales. The great success of continuous time models for description of stock markets and valuations of options on stocks strongly influenced research in the term structure of interest rates. In the majority of papers the dynamics of prices of zero-coupon bonds with maturity θ is described by a diffusion process P t (θ), t ≤ θ, where θ is considered as a continuous parameter. However, only a few works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and some others) deal with jump-diffusion models in spite of the evidences in favour of the latter. The subject of the absolute majority of the above references can be characterized as that of a special theory of bond markets: mathematical description of price evolution of basic securities and floating interest rates.</p><p>The problem of term structure of interests rates is, of course, very important (and one can even imagine that these key words are synonymous to the mathematical theory of bond markets). Given an adequate model for security prices one can use it for valuation of contingent claims and hedging positions by replication of a claim by dynamically rebalanced portfolios. Here we come to a very important difference of all widely accepted models of bond markets from that of a stock market:</p><p>in the continuous-time bond market model there is naturally a continuum of basic traded securities (zero-coupon bonds parameterized by their maturities θ) while in the standard model of a stock market there is normally only a finite number of securities.</p><p>This observation makes clear that a consistent theory must admit hedging portfolios which may contain an infinite number and even a continuum of securities. Certainly, this implies the necessity of a rigorous mathematical definition of such a portfolio. In a stock market with d underlying assets, a vector φ = (φ 1 , ..., φ d ) representing the quantities of assets of each type kept at t in a portfolio can be identified with a linear functional (i.e. with an element of the dual space R d * coinciding with R d ); a portfolio value V t is the action φ t P t of this functional to the price vector P t = (P 1 t , . . . , P d t ) (and this is just a scalar product); after the work by Harrison and Pliska <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the most general and widely accepted model for the dynamics of the latter is a semimartingale while the time-evolution of a portfolio strategy is described by a predictable process. The classic stochastic calculus provides all necessary machinery for the model: the integration theory for semimartingales is tailor-made for mathematical analysis of stock markets.</p><p>In the context of a bond market, P t is not a finite-dimensional vector but a price curve, i.e. an element of some functional vector space; apparently, the Banach space of continuous functions is adequate to the problem and the idea of considering the evolution of the price curve P t (.) in a such space has been exploited, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>It is natural to extend the definition of a portfolio as a continuous linear functional; in this case again V t = φ t P t and, by analogy, one could expect that the relevant mathematics here is an integration theory with respect to Banach spacevalued semimartigales. Surprisingly, we enter here terra incognita: the existing literature on the infinite-dimensional stochastic integration does not meet the needs of mathematical finance; moreover, it is not clear what should be called a semimartingale in this case, see Remark on p. 18 in the recent article by Laurent Schwartz <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>In the present paper we suggest two approaches to a stochastic integration which serves as modelling tool of the bond market theory. The first one, given in Section 2 and inspired by the book of Métivier <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, is based on the concept of controlled processes as integrators. It is important to note that our integrands are weakly predictable measure-valued processes; this not only allows us to avoid problems arising from non-separability of the space of measures in the total variation topology but also opens a way to practical applications since one can approximate "theoretical" portfolios by "realistic" strategies involving only a finite (but arbitrary large) number of securities. We prove in Section 3 that an asset giving an interest equal to the spot rate (its presence in a "zero-coupon bond market" is usually justified by some limit procedure) is a portfolio of just maturing bonds; this portfolio involves a continuum of bonds but instantaneously it contains only a single one.</p><p>In Section 4 it is considered a jump-diffusion model, where the price process of each single bond (i.e. a "section" of the price curve dynamics) is a rather general semimartingale. For this model, including the majority of those discussed in the literature, we suggest another approach to define the integral for measurevalued integrands; the integration theory is reduced via Fubini theorems to the standard stochastic calculus. We prove that, modulo a slight difference in hypotheses, the alternative construction results in the same process as the general one. Since the integration theory in this paper is intended only for financial modelling we are always trying to be on a reasonable level of generality, leaving possible extensions for the future.</p><p>In Section 5 we treat in detail the jump-diffusion model specified through the dynamics of the forward rate curves. We investigate here the problem of existence of a martingale measure and derive HJM-type conditions for the coefficients.</p><p>Section 6 is devoted to the hedging of contingent claims in a bond market. It is well-known that in the mathematical theory of security markets the problem of hedging is closely related to the completeness of a market. There is an informal principle (seems to have been formulated first by Bensoussan in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>): to hedge against n sources of randomness one needs n non-redundant securities besides the numéraire. According to this principle, there is no completeness in a stock market model based on a Lévy process with continuous jump spectrum and hence with a continuum of sources of randomness which is too much for a market with a finite number of stocks. The absence of completeness is one of the principal objections against seemingly more adequate models driven by a Lévy process.</p><p>Fortunately, in a bond market model where there is, by definition, a continuum of securities one can construct a hedge using strategies involving a continuum of assets. Nevertheless, it turns out that, in general, one can hedge (even with measure-valued portfolios) in the most favorable situation only a dense subset in the space of contingent claims. We examine the problem by considering families of "martingale operators" and their adjoints, "hedging operators", and relate the uniqueness of a martingale measure with the injectivity of martingale operators while the market completeness requires surjectivity of hedging operators. The latter, being integral operators of the first kind, may have, at best, a dense image and only in the "degenerate case" of a finite Lévy measure are surjective (iff the martingale operators are injective). This reasoning leads to the conclusion that the fundamental concept is the approximate completeness which is equivalent to the uniqueness of the martingale measure.</p><p>In our paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> addressed to readers which are mostly interested in the financial counterpart of the theory (and which deals with technically simpler models) we provide some more specific results on a market completeness and the structure of hedgeable claims.</p><p>It is worth to note that in stock market models a continuum of derivative securities is also implicitly present, say, call options parameterized by the maturity time and/or strikes, and, therefore, our approach can also be applied to such security markets. Moreover, the theory developed here gives a hint why real-world financial markets generate an enormous amount of various derivative securities: typically they are not driven by a finite number of sources of randomness and the risk averse agents, preferring at least an "approximately" complete market create a corresponding demand.</p><p>At last, Appendix contains stochastic versions of the Fubini theorem for continuous martingales and random measures.</p></div>

(2.3)</formula><p>To ensure the path regularity of φ • P (in other words, to be càdlàg) for elementary integrands we impose on P the following Assumption 2.1 The process P is weakly regular: there is a set Ω 1 with P(Ω 1 ) = 1 such that for any ω ∈ Ω 1 and m ∈ M T the real function mP . (ω) := P . (θ, ω)m(d θ) is right-continuous and with left limits.</p><p>To extend the integral to a reasonably large class of integrands we need Assumption 2.2 There exist a predictable random measure κ(dt, du) = l t (du)dt given on (R + × U , B + ⊗ U ) where (U , U ) is some Lusin space, K t := 1 + κ([0, t] × U ) &lt; ∞ for finite t, and a measurable function</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p : (Ω × R + × U × M T , P ⊗ U ⊗ M T ) → (R + , B + )</formula><p>with the following properties: (a) p(ω, t, u, .) is a seminorm on M T , (b) p(ω, t, u, .) is weakly continuous, (c) p(ω, t, u, m) ≤ m V , (d ) for any T ∈ R + there is a constant C T such that for any stopping time τ ≤ T and any</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">φ ∈ E b E sup t≤τ |φ • P t | 2 ≤ C T EK τ τ 0 U p 2 (s, u, φ s )κ(ds, du). (2.4)</formula><p>We shall say that (κ, p) in the above condition is a control pair for P and that a process P satisfying Assumption 2.2 is a controlled process.</p><p>Clearly, a linear combination of controlled processes is again a controlled process.</p><p>Let τ be a bounded stopping time such that EK 2 τ &lt; ∞. Let us introduce the linear space L 2 τ = L 2 τ (p, κ) of all predictable processes φ with values in M T such that q τ (φ) &lt; ∞, where q τ = q τ (.; κ, p) is a seminorm on L 2 τ defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">q 2 τ (φ) := EK τ τ 0 U p 2 (s, u, φ s )κ(ds, du). (2.5)</formula><p>Lemma 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> The linear space E b is dense in L 2 τ in the topology given by q τ . Proof. The inclusion E b ⊂ L 2 τ holds due to Assumption 2.2.(c). To show that it is dense, notice that the ball B c := m : m V ≤ c is compact in the weak topology of M T (the Banach-Alaoglu theorem) and metrizable. Hence, a measurable mapping φ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(Ω × R + , P ) → (B c , M T | Bc )</formula><p>can be approximated in the sense of the weak convergence by P -measurable step functions, i.e. by processes of the form I Ai (ω, t)m i where A i are predictable sets. The properties (b) and (c) ensure that the approximating sequence converges to φ in the seminorm q τ . Since the real-valued predictable processes</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">a i I Γi ×]ti ,ti+1] (ω, t)</formula><p>(which are a generating set for P , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) are dense in L 2 (P , d PdK τ ), we get that the elements of E b are dense in the set of norm-bounded predictable processes in the topology given by q τ and hence in L 2 τ . Let Π τ be the vector space of real adapted processes with regular trajectories equipped with the seminorm π τ (Y ) = (E sup t≤τ |Y t | 2 ) 1/2 (as usual, we identify indistinguishable processes). It is well-known that Π τ is complete with respect to this seminorm.</p><p>Thus, the linear mapping φ → I [0,τ ] φ • P defined on E b and taking values in Π τ , which is continuous by <ref type="bibr">(2.4)</ref>, can be extended to the unique continuous linear mapping from L 2 τ into Π τ . Standard localization arguments allow us to extend the definition of the integral φ • P to all predictable processes φ such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">t 0 U p 2 (s, u, φ s )κ(ds, du) &lt; ∞ a.s. (2.6)</formula><p>for all finite t. Let (κ, p ) be another control pair. Then (κ, p ) := (κ, p +p ) is again a control pair. Assume that φ satisfies (2.6) together with the corresponding relation for (κ, p ) and hence for (κ, p ) also.</p><p>Since the seminorm q τ (.; κ, p + p ) is stronger than q τ (.; κ, p), the integral φ • P defined using (κ, p) coincides with that based on (κ, p ) and, by symmetry, on (κ, p ). Thus, the integral does not depend on the particular choice of p, and, by similar arguments, on the particular choice of κ. Thus, the definition of the integral (which is a class of indistinguishable processes) is independent on the particular choice of a control pair (κ, p). We denote the class of processes for which the integral in the above sense exists by L 2 loc (P ) (the set of weakly predictable processes satisfying (2.6)). One can notice that the integral φ • P is a process which can be approximated uniformly in probability by "elementary" integrals of the form (2.3).</p><p>As usual, for any stopping time σ we have φ </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">• P σ = I [0,σ]</formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">:= φ • P we put H • X := ξ j (X tj+1 -X tj ). It follows from (2.4) that E sup t≤τ |H • X t | 2 ≤ H 2 EK τ τ 0 U p 2 (s, u, φ s )κ(ds, du).</formula><p>We easily infer from this inequality that for a sequence of bounded elementary integrands H n uniformly converging to zero the sequence of integrals H n • X ∞ tends to zero in probability. Thus, X is a semimartingale by the Dellacherie-Bichteler-Mokobodzki theorem, see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>(b) The property is evident for elementary integrands. In the general case the integral is defined through uniform convergence which preserves continuity.</p><p>(c) From the definition it follows that for an elementary integrand φ n the process φ n • P is a martingale and E |φ n • P τ | 2 &lt; ∞ for any τ such that EK 2 τ &lt; ∞. If, moreover, τ is such that the right-hand side of (2.4) is finite we conclude, by the approximation, that the stopped process φ • P τ is a square integrable martingale. Proposition 2.5 Let P 1 , P 2 be two controlled processes and φ be a process integrable with respect to P 1 and P 2 , i.e. φ ∈ L 1 (P 1 ) ∩ L 1 (P 2 ). Then φ ∈ L 1 (P 1 + P 2 ) and φ</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">• (P 1 + P 2 ) = φ • P 1 + φ • P 2 .</formula><p>Proof. Let (κ i , p i ) be a control pair for P i such that, with terms indexed by i , the relation (2.6) holds. Without loss of generality we can assume that U 1 and U 2 are distinct. Put U := U 1 ∩ U 2 and define p := p 1 I U1 + p 2 I U2 , κ := κ 1 I U1 + κ 2 I U2 . Clearly, (κ, p) is a control pair for P 1 + P 2 and since φ satisfies (2.6) the result holds.</p><p>Remark. The above construction of the stochastic integral goes well without any changes for an arbitrary Banach space. Certainly, the definition of the control pair can be modified and generalized in various ways (e.g., one can modify (2.4) by taking the supremum not over [0, τ] but over [0, τ[ as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>). A more general integration theory merits a special study which is beyond of the scope of the present paper.</p><p>3 General model of a bond market 1. The forward and spot rates In the mathematical description of a bond market it is usually assumed that for fixed θ ∈ T the process P t (θ), t ∈ [0, θ], gives the dynamics of the default-free zero-coupon bond (with unit nominal value) maturing at time θ. Evidently, this process must be strictly positive and P θ (θ) = 1.</p><p>It would be quite natural to impose also the constraint P t (θ) ≤ 1 but, following the tradition, we do not persist on this requirement since it excludes some easily treated models leading to explicit formulae.</p><p>In the continuous-time modelling of bond markets (in contrast with that of stock markets) the straightforward specification of the evolution of asset prices as a diffusion or jump-diffusion is not convenient. The main methodology is to start with a model for interest rates; the general opinion now is in favour of the forward rate though the models based on the spot rate have their own advantages. We shall follow the same mainstream of ideas adapting it to our approach which emphasizes the evolution of the whole price curve in the space of continuous functions in contrast with the traditional point of view that considers as primary object a family of individual price processes parameterized by bond maturities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assumption 3.1</head><p>The price curve dynamics is given by a controlled process P = (P t ). There exists a C T -valued adapted process f = f (t) such that for any θ ∈ T</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P t (θ) = exp - θ t f (t, s)ds , t ≤ θ. (3.1)</formula><p>The random variable f (t, θ) is called the instantaneous forward spot rate (at time t of the bond maturing at θ) or simply the forward rate. By definition, r t := f (t, t) is the instantaneous spot rate or simply the spot rate (called in the literature also the short rate, instantaneous riskless rate etc.). Remark. One can assume that P (t, θ) is continuously differentiable in θ and define the forward rate in an equivalent way as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">f (t, θ) = - ∂ ∂θ ln P t (θ). (3.2)</formula><p>In almost all known models (quite often implicitly) it is assumed that there is a traded asset that pays interest r t , i.e. the unit of money invested at time zero in this asset results at t in the amount</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">R -1 t := exp t 0</formula><p>r s ds (one can think about a bank account with the floating rate r t ).</p><p>It is convenient to take this asset as a numéraire, that is to express all other values in the units of this particular security. Prices calculated in units of the numéraire are called the discounted prices; in our case the discounting factor is R t . This means that the discounted price process Z is given by the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Z t (θ) := R t P t (θ) = exp - t 0 r s ds P t (θ). (3.3)</formula><p>It is instructive to understand a possible reasoning explaining the "existence" of this numéraire. Let us split the interval [0, t] into small subintervals ]t i , t i +1 ] and consider the strategy to invest at time zero a unit amount of money into the bond maturing at t 1 , at the moment t 1 to reinvest the obtained value (which is equal to P -1 0 (t 1 -)) into the bond maturing at t 2 , and so on. Clearly, under a mild condition of equicontinuity, at time t the resulting amount is</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">exp N i =0 ti+1 ti f (t i , s)ds ≈ exp N i =0 r ti (t i +1 -t i ) ,</formula><p>and it approximates R -1 t . In other words, the existence of the asset with the interest r t means that we are allowed to execute a roll-over strategy on justmaturing bonds which leads to a portfolio involving a continuum of securities.</p><p>Up to now the bond price P t (θ) has been given only for t ≤ θ. To work with processes defined for all t ∈ R + we put P t (θ) = R -1 t R θ for t ≥ θ. One can think that after maturity the bond is transferred automatically into the unit of money in the bank account.</p><p>There is another option: reparameterize the model by considering θ as time to maturity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Portfolios of bonds</head><p>We define a (feasible) portfolio or trading strategy as a pair (φ, η) where φ is a P -integrable predictable measure-valued process, η is a real predictable process with</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">t 0 |η s |ds &lt; ∞ (3.4)</formula><p>for finite t.</p><p>The value process of such a portfolio is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">V t (φ, η) = φ t P t + η t β t (3.5) with β := R -1 .</formula><p>We shall consider as admissible only strategies with value processes bounded from below.</p><p>A portfolio is said to be self-financing if its increments are caused by price movements only, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">V t (φ, η) = x + φ • P t + η • β t (3.6)</formula><p>where x is an initial endowment.</p><p>We show now that the roll-over "strategy" of permanent reinvestment of the whole current value V t-in the just maturing bond (without involving the "bank account") is an admissible portfolio (φ, η) = (V -δ, 0) where V -:= (V t-) and δ t is a unit mass on T concentrated at the point t, and this portfolio gives rise to an asset with interest rate r. Formally, this means that the linear equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">V = 1 + V -δ • P (3.7)</formula><p>has a solution, the solution is unique and coincides with β. The result (under certain additional hypotheses) is a corollary of the following two lemmas.</p></div>

For the above theorem, Assumption 6.3 (a), is not, of course, very pleasant since it, actually, means that the set Q (always assumed to be nonempty) contains a measure under which the compensator has such a property.

We believe that Theorem 6.11 can be extended to a much more general setting.</p><p>For a model when all measures λ t (dx ) are concentrated in a finite number of points (in particular, when the mark space X is finite) and the hedging problem is reduced to a finite-dimensional system of equations (for each (ω, t)), the duality relation is simply (Ker K ) ⊥ = Im K * , so in this case we have Corollary 6.12 Suppose that the measures λ t (dx ) are concentrated in a finite number of points (a.e.). Then the bond market is complete iff the martingale measure is unique.</p><p>In general, the "principle" that uniqueness of Q is equivalent to completeness of the market fails: the set of hedgeable claims may be a strict subset in the set of all claims L ∞ (F T ). Clearly, this is the case when D is smooth in x and bounded (so, the image contains only continuous functions); typically, K Z * t is a compact operator and, hence, has no bounded inverse. Thus, models with an infinite mark space introduce some completely new features into the theory, and we also encounter some new problems when it comes to the numerical computation of hedging portfolios. Namely, the hedging equations (6.17) are, in general, ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard, i.e. the inverse of K Z * t restricted to Im K Z * t may not be bounded. Hence, a small perturbation of the right-hand side (e.g., due to a small round-off error) gives rise to large fluctuations in the solution. Thus, a simple approximation scheme for the calculation of a concrete hedge may lead to great numerical errors. Fortunately, the literature provides a number of methods to get stable solutions of ill-posed problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>A consistent theory of the zero-coupon bond markets can be based on a setting where the price curve is considered as a point in the Banach space of continuous functions and its evolution is described by a random process in this space. In such an approach a portfolio strategy at a fixed time is identified with a linear functional which is an element of the conjugate space, i.e. a measure on maturities. The dynamics of a strategy is given by a weakly predictable measure-valued process.</p><p>The needed mathematical tool is a stochastic integration with respect to Cvalued processes for which our paper suggests a certain general recipe. As a justification of the general framework, we prove that the asset paying an interest corresponding to the short term interest rate is the value process of a roll-over strategy consisting in permanent reinvestment in just maturing bonds. Traditionally, the existence of such an asset in a bond market is an auxiliary hypothesis explained by heuristic arguments.</p><p>The integration theory has a more explicit structure for models where the dynamics of any bond, i.e. evolution of each point of the price curve, is given by a jump-diffusion model. In this case, one can use a construction involving standard finite-dimensional integrals. Starting the modelling from the description of the forward rate dynamics we derive HJM-type conditions for the existence of an equivalent martingale measure.</p><p>The formal definition of a portfolio strategy allows to define other economically meaningful properties of a bond market, in particular, market completeness. For a model with a finite Lévy measure we show that the completeness is equivalent to the uniqueness of the equivalent martingale measure, a relation which is well-known for stock market models. However, in the case of an infinite Lévy measure this is no longer true; it happens that the uniqueness of the equivalent martingale measure is a property that holds iff the market is approximately complete, i.e. every contingent claim can be approached in a certain sense by a sequence of hedgeable claims. This result is deduced from duality considerations leading, moreover, to the conclusion that the hedging problem is ill-posed.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the results of this paper open the door to a systematic use of models driven by Lévy processes that give better statistical fitting of real-world financial data but lead to theoretical difficulties related to absence of completeness. Moreover, the idea of measure-valued portfolios seems to be useful also in the context of stock markets augmented by an infinite number of derivative securities or bonds.</p><p>One can observe that a number of questions are only briefly touched here and we foresee further mathematical developments within the framework of the considered approach.</p></div>

Actually, the stochastic Fubini theorem is rather unfortunate: even the usually reliable source <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> contains an erroneous formulation in Theorem 5.44 (see p. 161 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for a counterexample and further remarks). The most general results are given in the recent deep study <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> where the problem is treated in the framework of vector integration theory (independently, the same approach to the stochastic Fubini theorem is used in the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> submitted, however, much later).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(b) Notice that, under (4.11), (4.12), one can write instead of (4.13) that for τ ≤ T &lt; ∞</figDesc></figure>

Recall that balls in M R+ are metrizable compacts, hence, (M R+ , M R+ ) is a Lusin space as a countable union of Polish spaces. The function F ε , being P -measurable in (ω, t) and continuous in m, is jointly measurable. Thus, the set-valued mapping (ω, t) → {m ∈ M R+ : F ε (ω, t, m) ≤ ε} has a P ⊗ M R+ -measurable graph and, by assumption, non-empty values (a.e.). Therefore, it admits a P -measurable a.e.-selector m ε (t, d θ) (see, e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), which "almost" solves the problem.
