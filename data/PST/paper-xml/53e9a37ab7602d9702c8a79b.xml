<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In 1996, Ajtai established a remarkable connection between the worst-case and average-case complexity of certain computational problems on lattices <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. He showed that approximating the length of the shortest nonzero vector in n-dimensional lattices to within a certain connection factor γ(n) = poly(n) in the worst case reduces to solving a related problem on the average. This result opened the door to basing cryptography on a worst-case assumption, namely, that no efficient algorithm can approximately solve the shortest vector problem (SVP) to within a γ(n) factor on every lattice of dimension n.</p><p>It seems reasonable to assume that SVP is indeed hard. The problem dates back over 150 years, and it has been heavily scrutinized ever since. A major breakthrough occurred in 1982, when Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lovász designed an efficient algorithm that approximates SVP to within a 2 O(n) factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref> (which was later improved to 2 O(n(log log n) 2 / log n) by Schnorr <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[47]</ref>). While the so-called LLL algorithm has proved to be useful in many diverse applications, its approximation factors are much too large to undermine the hardness assumption associated with Ajtai's result. To date, the asymptotically best algorithm for SVP offers a trade-off between solution quality and running time, and for any poly(n) approximation factor still requires time exponential in n <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In Ajtai's original reduction, the connection factor γ(n) was a rather large polynomial in n. Due to the known time/quality tradeoffs, it is desirable from both a theoretical and practical point of view to obtain reductions for as small of a γ(n) as possible. This was a main goal of several follow-up works <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">37]</ref>, resulting in the currently best known connection factor of γ(n) = Õ(n) by Micciancio and Regev <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The SVP also has the interesting property that it is NP-hard for small approximation factors (under randomized reductions). Ajtai first showed hardness for its exact version (in the Euclidean norm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[5]</ref>. This result was improved in a series of works to hardness for any constant approximation factor unless NP ⊆ RP <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">30]</ref>, and for almost-polynomial factors 2 log 1-n unless NP ⊆ RTIME(2 polylog(n) ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">29]</ref>. The latter results already approach the perceived limits on the hardness of approximating SVP, as NP-hardness beyond O( √ n) factors would imply that NP ⊆ coNP <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> (or NP ⊆ coAM, for factors beyond O( n/ log n) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22]</ref>).</p><p>In light of the above, improving the worst-case/average-case connection factor to γ(n) = n 1/2- appears problematic. In particular, it would imply cryptographic functions based on problems not known to be in coNP or coAM; as shown by Akavia et al, this would require significantly new ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[8]</ref>. Going even further to, say, γ(n) = polylog(n) would imply cryptography based on quasi-NP-hardness, a feat which appears far beyond our current capabilities. (Though see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref> for an interesting first step in this direction.)</p><p>Note that all the perceived barriers to improving the connection factor are based on the complexity of the decision version of SVP. However, Ajtai's reduction actually solves certain search problems on lattices. So one potential route to tighter connection factors would be to identify a suitable worst-case problem whose search version appears hard, but whose decision version is easy. Doing so would render the perceived barriers vacuous, while preserving or even improving the concrete hardness of the average-case problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Our Results</head><p>We put forward a new class of lattices that admit very small worst-case to average-case connection factors. These lattices correspond to certain algebraic structures, namely ideals in the ring of integers of a suitable algebraic number field. Our worst-case problem is to find approximate shortest vectors in such lattices, under an appropriate form of preprocessing of the number field.</p><p>For the connection factors we achieve, the corresponding decision problems on these lattices are not known to be NP-hard; in fact, they are in P. However, the search approximation problems still appear to be very hard. Indeed, the best known algorithms for these special lattices seem to perform no better than the best known algorithms for general lattices.</p><p>The high-level structure of our worst-case/average-case reduction inherits from a sequence of works starting with Ajtai's original paper <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> and the improvements proposed by Micciancio and Regev <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref>, as well as the works of Micciancio <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>, Peikert and Rosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[42]</ref>, and Lyubashevsky and Micciancio <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>. The latter works generalized the role of the integers Z in prior reductions, replacing them with some "larger" ring to obtain efficient cryptographic primitives. We show that by substituting Z with a ring of algebraic integers, one can also obtain significantly better connection factors. Our analysis identifies the root discriminant of the number field as the main quantity governing this improvement.</p><p>Informal Theorem. Let K be a number field of degree n having root discriminant D K . Then there exists an average-case problem which is as hard as finding a γ-approximate shortest nonzero vector in any ideal lattice over K, where γ ∼ D 1.5  K • √ log n.</p><p>It is a known fact of algebraic number theory that there exist computable infinite families of number fields (of increasing degree n) having constant root discriminant <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[46]</ref>, though we do not know of any efficient construction. In lattices defined over these families, therefore, we obtain a connection factor of O( √ log n). More generally, any family of number fields whose root discriminants are as large as O(n 2/3-) yield lattices admitting connection factors better than Õ(n).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Explicitness</head><p>As far as we are aware, it is still unknown how to efficiently compute families of number fields having very small root discriminant. A review of the literature suggests that a fair amount of attention has been devoted to searching for number fields having highly-optimized root discriminants for small fixed degrees (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>). To our knowledge, the problem of efficiently constructing good asymptotic families of number field has not received nearly as much attention. The best construction we know of is an infinite family of cyclotomic number fields having root discriminants as small as O(n(log log n)/(log n)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[48]</ref>. As mentioned above, families having root discriminants even up to O(n 2/3-) would yield improved connection factors for ideal lattices.</p><p>We remark that, while number fields having small root discriminant appear to be rare, one can efficiently compute the root discriminant of any given number field. Therefore it is easy to recognize a good number field once it is discovered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Uniformity</head><p>Our reductions require a small amount of non-uniform advice, which is simply a form of preprocessing: the computational problems are parameterized by some fixed choice of number field, and the non-uniform advice depends only on this choice (not on the input instance). Preprocessing is a standard notion for computational problems over codes and lattices <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21]</ref>, and it seems to be the proper way of stating problems in our setting, given that in real applications the number fields will be chosen well in advance of any particular problem instance. We remark that preprocessing does not seem to help solve our worst-case problems.</p><p>A certain amount of advice about the number field also seems necessary for obtaining useful cryptographic hardness, e.g. collision-resistant hash functions. The reason is that we need a way to map inputs of the cryptographic function to "short" algebraic integers. On the face of it, computing such a mapping appears to require some particular information about the number field. See Section 10 for further discussion.</p><p>Note that explicit constructions of number fields may actually come with the required advice "by design," removing the non-uniformity from our reductions entirely and enabling cryptographic hardness. This is indeed the case for the cyclotomic number fields mentioned above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">The Worst-Case Problem</head><p>Our results are based on the worst-case problem of finding a relatively short non-zero vector in any ideal lattice over certain families of number fields of increasing degree, allowing for arbitrary preprocessing of the number fields. The vector must be short relative to every p length.</p><p>Due to the algebraic structure of ideal lattices, it is actually trivial to closely approximate the length λ 1 of a shortest nonzero vector. This is because in ideal lattices, λ 1 is always within a √ D K factor of Minkowski's upper bound (where D K is the root discriminant of the number field), and this bound is easily computed.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> However, it does not appear that this makes the search problem any easier. In particular, the search and decision problems are not known to be equivalent (and for general lattices, they are only known to be equivalent when the decision problem is NP-hard).</p><p>Finding short vectors in ideal lattices over number fields is a long-standing open problem in algebraic number theory, and is considered to be one of the motivations for the development of the celebrated LLL algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref>. The problem also plays a role in the Number Field Sieve factoring algorithm and in "ideal reduction," which is, for example, an essential step in the computation of the unit group and class group of a number field (this is a reason why the recent quantum algorithm of Hallgren <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref> is limited to fixed degree). Any efficient algorithm for finding short vectors in ideal lattices in the worst case would be considered a major breakthrough in computational number theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">12]</ref>.</p><p>It is hard to qualitatively compare our worst-case/average-case connections with those known for general lattices. On the one hand, our worst-case problem is restricted to a subclass of lattices and hence could be seen as potentially easier than the problems on general lattices. On the other hand, our connection factor is substantially smaller, hence our reduction could be seen as solving a potentially harder problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Additional Contributions</head><p>We additionally give relationships between various worst-case problems on ideal lattices. Specifically, we establish approximation-preserving reductions (in any p length) from the shortest vector problem (SVP) to the closest vector problem (CVP), and from the exact search version of CVP to the corresponding decision version. Analogous results were already known for general lattices <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>, but these reductions do not preserve the "ideal" structure of their inputs. (That is, the instances generated by the reduction are not necessarily ideal lattices, even if the input lattice is ideal.) Our new reductions rely crucially on the splitting behavior of integer primes over number fields.</p><p>We give bounds on many standard lattice quantities for ideal lattices, including the successive minima, basis minimum, and covering radius, in arbitrary p lengths. We also give a new bound on the smoothing parameter which, for ideal lattices over number fields with small root discriminant, is significantly stronger than a prior bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we point out that number fields having constant root discriminant give rise to a collection of lattices that exemplify the tightness of known transference theorems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">11]</ref>, simultaneously in all p lengths, up to constant factors (or O( √ log n) factors for p = 1, ∞). This provides a more general alternative to a similar family of lattices by Conway and Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[39]</ref>, which are tight for the 2 length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview of Techniques</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Ajtai's Framework</head><p>Like almost all prior works on worst-case/average-case reductions for lattice problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">43]</ref>, we follow the framework initiated by <ref type="bibr">Ajtai [4]</ref>. This framework shows how to reduce worstcase lattice problems to finding "small" nonzero solutions to random linear equations over certain additive groups G. Specifically, the equations to be solved are of the form j a j • z j = 0 ∈ G, for independent and uniformly-random elements a j ∈ G and unknown variables z j ∈ Z.</p><p>To find a short vector in an arbitrary input lattice Λ, the reduction samples random a j ∈ G in a way that is related to Λ. The core idea is a method of sampling a j ∈ G together with a short "offset" vector d j ∈ R n . The crucial property of the sampling procedure is this: for any z j 's satisfying the equation a j • z j = 0, the vector v = d j • z j ∈ R n is a vector in the input lattice Λ (and is non-zero with significant probability). In particular, when the coefficients z j are small, the resulting vector v is relatively short. The length of v, and consequently the connection factor of the reduction, is therefore governed by two main quantities: (1) the "effective size" of the average-case solution (i.e., the amount by which it expands the offset vectors), and (2) the lengths of the offset vectors d j themselves.</p><p>In Ajtai's original work <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, the group G is Z n q , for an appropriate q = poly(n). That is, the average-case problem is to find small integers z j such that a j • z j = 0 mod q, for a j chosen uniformly from Z n modulo q. In Ajtai's reduction, the effective size of the average-case solution is a small polynomial in n, and the length of the offset vectors is a poly(n) factor larger than the nth successive minimum λ n of Λ. This results in polynomial connection factors for several worst-case lattice problems.</p><p>In later work, Micciancio and Regev <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref> proposed an elegant method of implementing the sampling procedure, which improved both the effective size of the solution and the lengths of the offset vectors. Their method relies on adding n-dimensional Gaussian noise to "blur" the lattice, destroying its discrete structure. The amount of noise required to completely blur the lattice is called the smoothing parameter, which was shown to be bounded by ∼ λ n . Based on this bound, the sampling procedure produces offset vectors of length ∼ √ n • λ n , and it guarantees an average-case solution of effective size ∼ √ n. The reduction therefore produces lattice points of length ∼ n • λ n . Using several additional ideas, these techniques can also be used to approximate the length λ 1 of the shortest vector to within a factor ∼ n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Our Approach</head><p>We retain all the essential elements of Ajtai's framework and its subsequent improvements, but in a more general setting. The core of our approach is to replace the ring of integers Z with the ring of algebraic integers O K contained in a number field K of degree n. (The idea of replacing Z with some "larger" ring is rooted in work of Micciancio <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>, whose motivation was improved cryptographic efficiency. See Section 3 for details and a comparison to our work.)</p><p>A number field is a certain kind of field extension of the rationals Q. Every number field K contains a discrete ring O K , called the algebraic integers, which acts as an analog of the integers Z in Q. Strictly speaking, K (and in particular, O K ) is a subset of the complex numbers C. But K also corresponds very naturally to an n-dimensional geometric space via its canonical embedding. In this manner, elements in K can be viewed as vectors which can be added and multiplied, and which have magnitudes in various p lengths. In Ajtai's framework, replacing Z with O K alters the type of lattices underlying the worst-case problem. Instead of general lattices, which are made up of all the Z-combinations of some set of basis vectors, we end up with all O K -combinations of some basis elements in O K . Specifically, we get a set { c i • b i : c i ∈ O K } for some collection of elements b i ∈ O K , which is called an ideal in O K . When embedded in geometric space, an ideal yields an n-dimensional ideal lattice. This notion is quite natural and standard in algebraic number theory; see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Our average-case problem is defined in a similar way. An instance is given by a vector a = (a 1 , . . . , a m ) ∈ O m K where the a j are uniform and independent representatives from O K modulo q. The problem is to find a "small" solution z = (z 1 , . . . , z m ) ∈ O m K (for an appropriate notion of size) satisfying the equation m j=1 a j z j = 0 mod q. To obtain our improved connection factors, we will use number fields K having small root discriminant D K (as a function of the degree n). The best number fields for our purposes will have D K bounded by a constant, which is optimal. Using such number fields will yield a factor of ∼ √ n improvement in each of the two main aspects of the worst-case to average-case reduction:</p><p>1. Smaller average-case solutions. We show that our average-case problem admits very short solutions z ∈ O m K , having an "effective size" of ∼ √ log n. In all prior work, the solution size was at least √ n log n.</p><p>The improvement stems from properties of the algebraic integers O K . Like Z, the ring O K has a discrete structure and a geometric notion of "absolute value" |•|. In particular, for an element x ∈ O K with |x| ≤ β, multiplying an element by x increases its "size" by at most β.</p><p>The crucial difference between Z and O K is this: while Z contains only ∼ 2β elements of absolute value at most β, the ring O K contains ∼ β n such elements. Intuitively, and in a precise geometric sense, O K is much more "densely-packed" than Z.</p><p>Now consider any a ∈ O m K specifying an instance of the average-case problem. Because O K mod q has exactly q n residue classes, then intuitively we expect (at least) one out of every q n vectors z ∈ O m K to satisfy the equation a j z j = 0 mod q. The density of O K implies that there are ∼ β mn (non-zero) vectors z ∈ O m K with |z j | ≤ β for every j. By choosing β = O(1) and m = O(log n) appropriately so that the number of such z exceeds q n , we can show that at least one such z satisfies the equation.</p><p>In the reduction, the net effect of using such a z is the following: because |z j | ≤ β = O(1), each offset vector d j expands by only a constant factor when multiplied by z j . Because the reduction outputs the sum of m = O(log n) such (expanded) offset vectors, the output is only a O(log n) factor longer than the individual offsets. In fact, a more sophisticated analysis actually reveals that the overall expansion is only O( √ log n).</p><p>2. Smaller smoothing parameter. In addition, we show that "smoothing" ideal lattices requires much less noise than general lattices. For ideal lattices over number fields with constant D K , the smoothing parameter is ∼ λ 1 / √ n, whereas for general lattices it can be as large as ∼ λ n ≥ λ 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref>. In the reduction, then, the length of the offset vectors d j is ∼ λ 1 . Combined with the size of the average-case solutions, this fact accounts for our O( √ log n) connection factor for SVP.</p><p>The improved smoothing parameter stems from the fact that ideal lattices and their duals simultaneously have large minimum distances λ 1 (which in turn is due to their algebraic properties). In fact, the relationship is near optimal: for an ideal lattice Λ and its dual Λ * (over some K having constant D K ), we have λ 1 (Λ) • λ 1 (Λ * ) = Ω(n), whereas the bound λ 1 (Λ) • λ 1 (Λ * ) ≤ n applies for any lattice Λ <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[10]</ref>. We find it a remarkable coincidence that the same property guaranteeing small average-case solutions (namely, small root discriminant) is also exactly what accounts for this improvement in the smoothing parameter.</p><p>In addition to the improved connection factors, we also obtain a unified reduction where the worst-case problem can be stated in terms of any p length, p ∈ [1, ∞]. The connection factor is (essentially) the same for all p. This result relies upon an analysis of Gaussian distributions over lattices from a concurrent work by Peikert <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Our treatment of general p lengths is partly motivated by a recent result of Regev and Rosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[45]</ref>, who showed that worst-case lattice problems are easiest in the 2 length (at least for general lattices). In light of this fact, obtaining reductions for arbitrary p lengths under a unified connection factor is much more desirable. Furthermore, in algebraic number theory there are multiple notions of magnitude which correspond to different p lengths, e.g. ∞ for the "height" of a number, and often 1 length for its "size."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Relationships Between Worst-Case Problems</head><p>We also provide some new reductions between worst-case problems on ideal lattices, showing, for example, that the shortest vector problem is no harder than the closest vector problem. For all of our results, analogous reductions are known for general lattices <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>, but those reductions do not work for ideal lattice problems because they perform transformations that can destroy the ideal property. Nevertheless, our reductions use techniques similar to those for general lattice problems.</p><p>The essential technique from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref> for reducing, say, the shortest vector problem to the closest vector problem involves constructing a special sequence of sublattices of the input lattice. In this work, we will generate subideals of the input ideal I by multiplying I by a certain collection of appropriately-chosen (fixed) ideals. The crucial property of this collection is that all its ideals are individually "small," and that their product is the ideal q generated by some integer q ∈ Z. Such a collection can be derived from any prime q ∈ Z that "splits well" over the number field K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Comparison to Related Work</head><p>The idea of exploiting special families of lattices is not new. Some of the results in Ajtai's original paper <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> are based on lattices that a have "unique" shortest vector (in some formal sense), as are the cryptosystems of Ajtai and Dwork <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[6]</ref> and Regev <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Micciancio generalized Ajtai's framework by replacing the integers Z with an alternate ring R for the purpose of cryptographic efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>. He proposed the ring of n-dimensional integer vectors Z n , with cyclic convolution as the product operation. This yielded an efficient and "compact" one-way function assuming the worst-case hardness of problems on cyclic lattices.</p><p>In later independent works, Peikert and Rosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[42]</ref> and Lyubashevsky and Micciancio <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref> observed that cyclic lattices actually correspond to ideals in the polynomial ring R = Z[x]/ x n -1 , and obtained efficient collision-resistant hash functions by exploiting the algebraic structure of this ring. The latter work also suggested generalizing to other rings of the form R = Z[x]/ f (x) for other degree-n polynomials f (x) satisfying certain special properties.</p><p>Our work is closely related to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33]</ref>, but differs in a couple of crucial ways. First, we use a different kind of ring, namely the algebraic integers O K in a number field K. In general, O K is not isomorphic to any ring of the form Z[x]/ f (x) . However, O K always contains such a subring, and in certain special cases they can coincide. For example, let n be a power of 2. Then for the cyclotomic number field</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q(ζ) where ζ = exp(πi/n) is a root of the irreducible polynomial f (x) = x n + 1, the ring O K is indeed isomorphic to Z[x]/ f (x) .</formula><p>We caution that cyclotomic number fields are a very special case in this respect, and that they unfortunately do not have the other properties we need to obtain improved connection factors.</p><p>Just as importantly, we use a different correspondence between elements of our ring O K and n-dimensional vectors. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33]</ref>, a polynomial residue g(x) ∈ R = Z[x]/ f (x) corresponds to a point in Z n simply by reading g's coefficients as an n-dimensional vector. In this work, we use the canonical embedding of K into an n-dimensional geometric space. Even when O K is isomorphic to a ring of the form R = Z[x]/ f (x) , the embedding of g ∈ R ≡ O K is in general quite different from the vector of g's coefficients. Our use of the canonical embedding will prove crucial in characterizing the geometric structure of ideal lattices.</p><p>Implicit in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref> is a bound on the smoothing parameter (similar to ours) for the special class of lattices having near-optimal (dual) minimum distances. This yields a connection factor of Õ( √ n) for such lattices (because the solutions to the average-case problem are still of size ∼ √ n). Prior to our work, however, it was not clear whether there were any candidate families of such lattices that were amenable to a worst-case hardness assumption. (The sequence of lattices constructed by Conway and Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[39]</ref>, for example, are optimal with respect to minimum distance, but it is not clear whether the sequence even contains more than one lattice per dimension n.)</p></div>

Due to this isomorphism, it actually does not matter which root ζ of f we adjoin to Q, as they all yield isomorphic number fields.

An embedding whose image lies in R (corresponding to a real root of f ) is called a real embedding; otherwise (for a complex root of f ) it is called a complex embedding. Just as f has pairs of complex conjugate roots, the complex embeddings of K are also paired into complex conjugates τ, τ where τ (x) = τ (x) for all x ∈ K. The number of real embeddings is denoted r 1 , and the number of pairs of conjugate complex embeddings is denoted r 2 , so we have n = r 1 + 2r 2 . The pair (r 1 , r 2 ) is called the signature of K.

For all of our results, analogous reductions are known to exist for general lattices <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>, but those reductions are not valid for ideal lattice problems because they query their oracles on non-ideal lattices. Nevertheless, the reductions we demonstrate here use techniques similar to those for general lattice problems.</p><p>The essential technique from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref> for reducing, say, SVP to CVP can be abstracted in the following way: for an instance involving a lattice Λ, construct a carefully-chosen set of sublattices Λ i ⊆ Λ such that (1) the quotient groups Λ/Λ i are all small, and (2) the intersection of all the Λ i s cannot contain a shortest vector of Λ. For general lattices, Λ i is constructed simply by doubling the ith basis vector of Λ, and leaving the remaining basis vectors unchanged. This makes the size of the quotient groups |Λ/Λ i | = 2, and the intersection Λ i = 2Λ. While this technique satisfies the conditions from above, in our setting it may not yield ideal sublattices.</p><p>Instead, we will generate subideals of the input ideal I by multiplying I by a collection of appropriately-chosen (fixed) ideals. We also generalize the above structure, constructing several chains of subideals I i,e ⊂ • • • ⊂ I i,1 ⊂ I i,0 = I such that (1) the quotient groups I i,j-1 /I i,j are all small, and (2) the intersection of all the I i,j s cannot contain a shortest vector in I.</p><p>Our reductions will rely on an integer prime q ∈ Z that "splits well" over O K into prime ideal divisors having small norm. That is, if q factors in O K as q = q e 1 1 • • • q e L L , we will need N (q i ) to be small for all i. One way (but not the only way) of satisfying this condition is to let q be a prime that splits completely in O K , namely, q factors into n distinct prime ideals, each of norm q. Guruswami <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref> demonstrated that there exist infinite families of number fields, all having the same (constant) root discriminant, for which some fixed q splits completely in every member of the family. Another way is to let q be a prime that is fully ramified in O K , namely, q = q n where N (q) = q.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Worst-Case to Average-Case Reduction</head><p>In this section we give a reduction from solving the problem IGVP (actually, its equivalent incremental version) in the worst case to solving SAIS on the average. We complete the section by connecting ISVP to IGVP for concrete choices of the family K of number fields. Theorem 9.1 (Main Reduction). For any infinite family of number fields K = {K n }, p ∈ [1, ∞], m(n), q(n), β(n) = poly(n) and γ(n) that satisfy the conditions below, there is a polynomial-time number field-preserving reduction from solving K-IncIGVP p,η γ (equivalently, K-IGVP p,η γ ) in the worst case to solving K-SAIS ∞ q,m,β on the average with non-negligible probability. The conditions on the parameters are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">1.

For instances of K-IncIGVP where K = K n is a number field in K, the advice about K needed by the reduction is an integral basis B = {b 1 , . . . , b n } ⊂ O K of K that is as short as possible in ∞ length.

Our reduction will need to "round off" elements in K = K n to nearby (but not necessarily nearest) algebraic integers in O K . The rounding algorithm will take a w ∈ K and the integral basis B of K discussed above, and will output some algebraic integer denoted w B ∈ O K . This can be accomplished by taking the representation of w in the basis B, w = i∈[n] c i b i where c i ∈ Q, and rounding each coefficient to the nearest integer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">w B = i∈[n] c i b i .

It suffices to bound the statistical distance ∆(a, U m (O K / q )) by m • /2 = ν(n). Each a j is independent, so by the triangle inequality it suffices to bound ∆(a j , U(O K / q )) by /2. First, by Lemma 4.3, ∆(y j , K/I) ≤ /2 (i.e., y j is almost uniform over K/I), and because v j is uniform over I/ x , we have ∆(v j + y j , U(K/ x )) ≤ /2. Because w j = qx -1 (v j + y j ), we have ∆(w j , U(K/ q )) ≤ /2. It follows by the description of the rounding algorithm that ∆(a j , U(O K / q )) ≤ /2, as desired. Claim 9.3.

There are two cases: if the right-hand side of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_61">4</ref>) is not in I, then the equation is satisfied with probability zero because the support of D I,s,-y 1 is I. If the right-hand side of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_61">4</ref>) is in I, then because s ≥ 2 • η (I), Lemma 4.6 guarantees that the equation is only satisfied with probability 2 -n • 1+ 1-= ν(n). By Claims 9.2 through 9.5 and the union bound, the reduction solves K-IncIGVP p,η γ with nonnegligible probability. This can be amplified to overwhelming probability by standard repetition techniques for worst-case problems. Theorem 9.1 follows. Theorem 9.1 concerns the average-case problem SAIS ∞ q,m,β , whose solutions must have ∞ length at most β. We can also show that the more relaxed average-case problem SAIS r q,m,β , whose solutions must have r length at most β • (mn) 1/r , is as hard as ISVP p γ for any p ≤ r, for almost identical connection factors. This may make it easier to construct cryptographic applications. Theorem 9.6.

The reduction is the same as the one from the proof of Theorem 9.1, and most of the proof remains the same as well. The only change is to the proof of Claim 9.4.</p><p>To prove Claim 9.4, we need to analyze the two terms of (3). For the first term, we only need the fact that for all j ∈ [m], z j ∞ ≤ z ∞ ≤ z r . By the definition of the problem K-SAIS r q,m,β , we have z r ≤ β • (mn) 1/r . By the (strengthened) hypothesis on q, the first term remains bounded by x p /4.</p><p>For the second term of (3), we use Lemma 6.8 rather than Lemma 6.7. By the hypothesis on γ, the second term also remains bounded by x p /4 with probability at least 1/2. This completes the proof.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Future Work</head><p>Our work opens up many avenues of investigation. The most important open problem, in our view, is the explicit construction of families of number fields having small root discriminant. By "explicit construction" we mean an efficient algorithm which, given n, outputs a full description of the degree-n number field from the family. Such constructions would also have applications in coding theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">25]</ref>. It would be even nicer to find an explicit construction which provides, by design, the non-uniform advice that is needed by our reductions.</p><p>Another important problem is to better understand the worst-case search version of SVP for ideal lattices over number fields. The situation seems to be quite different from that of general lattices, because in our case the decision version of SVP is easy for factors as small as √ D K . It would also be interesting to consider quantum algorithms for search-SVP on ideal lattices.</p><p>Our bound on the smoothing parameter for ideal lattices is most useful when the root discriminant of the number field is at most O( √ n). Beyond that point, the prior bound relating the smoothing parameter to λ n may be stronger <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref>. We leave it as an open problem to unify these two bounds for ideal lattices, for the full range of interesting values of the root discriminant.</p><p>In contrast to prior work on average-case hardness from lattice problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33]</ref>), we do not yet know how to obtain cryptographic hardness (e.g. collision-resistant hash functions) from ideal lattices over an arbitrary good number field K. The reason is that we seem to require an efficient injective mapping from function inputs (bit strings) to sufficiently short vectors z ∈ O m K . This appears to require some additional advice about the number field.</p><p>For example, if we had an "almost-orthogonal" short basis for O m K , then it would be possible to produce elements of O m K that are short enough in 2 length, simply by summing up subsets of the basis vectors. This would suffice for cryptographic hardness, assuming the worst-case difficulty of SVP on ideal lattices in the p norm for some p ≤ 2. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> As mentioned above, it is possible that explicit constructions of number fields might come with the required advice as a side-effect.</p><p>A final interesting question is whether the public-key cryptosystem of Regev <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44]</ref> can be adapted to work based on ideal lattices, with a corresponding improvement in its efficiency and connection factor. It seems plausible that this could be done without requiring the encryption and decryption algorithms to use any special advice about the number field (though the security reduction might still require it).</p><p>Lemma A.2. For any p ∈ [1, ∞) and every i ∈ [n], we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">E [|σ i (v)| p ] ≤ c p p • r i p 2 .</formula><p>Proof. We first start by setting up some notation for the application of Proposition A.1. Just as in Section 6.

The former case is somewhat simpler, so we start with it.</p><p>Define w ∈ H by w i = 1, and w k = 0 for all k = i. Then for any x ∈ K, we have σ i (x) = σ(x), w .

Now define w ∈ H to be the vector that "selects" the real part of the ith coordinate of any x ∈ H via Hermitian inner product, i.e., x, w = Re {x i }. Concretely, w i = w i+r 2 = 1/2 and w k = 0 otherwise.</p><p>As above, we can show that Re {σ i (v)} = yc , w = r yc , u where u ∈ H m is the unit vector parallel to appropriate w ∈ H m and</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">r 2 = w, w = j∈[m] σ i (z j ) 2 2 + σ i+r 2 (z j ) 2 2 = j∈[m] |σ i (z j )| 2 2 = r i 2 2</formula><p>2 .</p><p>Similarly, let w ∈ H be the vector that selects the imaginary part of the ith coordinate of x ∈ H, i.e. x, w = Im {x i }.

Each discrete Gaussian is scaled by a factor z j ∈ O K , where z = (z 1 , . . . , z m ) ∈ O m K is a short solution to the random instance of our average-case problem. Therefore the length of the output, and hence the quality of the reduction, is largely determined by the behavior of such sums of discrete Gaussians. In this section, we give tail bounds on the p length as a function of the length z r , for various values of p and r. The bounds follow from a general analysis of discrete Gaussians in a concurrent paper by Peikert <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[41]</ref>. Lemma 6.7. Let I be a fractional ideal over a number field K of degree n. Let m be a positive integer, ≤ 1/(2m+1) be a positive real, s ≥ η (I), and z, c ∈ K m . Let y j ∼ D I,s,c j be independent samples from discrete Gaussians over I, and define</p><p>, where</p><p>and c p is a constant depending only on p.</p><p>In the context of module lattices and our average-case problem, a requirement of the form z ∞ ≤ β (as in the lemma above) is qualitatively the strictest one we can impose. In light of Lemma 6.6, it is also interesting (and may be useful in cryptographic contexts) to consider relaxed requirements of the form z r ≤ β • (mn) 1/r for other r lengths. For such z, we can show a nearly identical bound on the sum of discrete Gaussians in any p length for p ≤ r.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Computational Problems on Ideal Lattices</head><p>In this section we define several computational problems (both worst-case and average-case) relating to number fields and ideal lattices. Proposition 8.2. For any γ and any p ∈ [1, ∞], there is a deterministic non-adaptive Cook reduction from K-ISVP p γ (resp., K-GapISVP p γ ) to K-ICVP p γ (resp., K-GapICVP p γ ). The reduction makes i∈[L] e i • (N (q i ) -1) oracle queries, and runs in time poly(S) • i∈[L] e i • N (q i ), where S is the input size.</p><p>Proof. We provide a reduction between the search problems, which can be easily adapted for the decision versions. The advice about K needed by the reduction is the value of q and the factorization of q into prime ideals.</p><p>Suppose oracle A solves K-ICVP p γ in the worst case. Then our reduction proceeds as follows: on input an ideal I ⊆ O K , 1. For each i ∈ [L] and each j ∈ {0, . . . , e i }, let I i,j = q j i I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">For each</head><p>and each nonzero t i,j,k ∈ I i,j-1 /I i,j , let v i,j,k ← A(I i,j , t i,j,k ).</p><p>3. Among all vectors t i,j,k -v i,j,k , output one whose p length is minimal.</p><p>We first analyze the running time of the reduction. Given bases for I and each q i we can efficiently compute a basis for I i,j = q j i I by performing j ≤ n multiplications of ideals. We can also enumerate over I i,j-1 /I i,j in time N (q i ) • poly(S). The size of I i,j-1 /I i,j is N (q i ), so the number of calls to A is i∈[L] e i • (N (q i ) -1)).</p><p>We now prove that the reduction is correct. First, we see that 0 = t i,j,k -v i,j,k ∈ I for every i, j, k, because both t i,j,k , v i,j,k ∈ I i,j-1 ⊂ I, but t i,j,k ∈ I i,j while v i,j,k ∈ I i,j . Therefore the reduction outputs a nonzero element of I. Now let w ∈ I be such that w p = λ p 1 (I). Then w ∈ i∈[L] (q e i i I) = qI. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists an i ∈ [L] such that w = 0 mod I i,e i . Then there exists a j ∈ [e i ] such that w = 0 mod I i,j but w = 0 mod I i,j-1 . Therefore there exists some k such that w = t i,j,k mod I i,j . Therefore dist p (t i,j,k , I i,j ) = dist p (w, I i,j ) ≤ w p = λ p 1 (I). By assumption on A, t i,j,k -v i,j,k p ≤ γ • dist p (t i,j,k , I i,j ) ≤ γ • λ p 1 (I), so the reduction solves ISVP p γ .</p><p>Reducing ICVP 1 to GapICVP 1 . Here we show a reduction from search to decision for the exact versions of the closest vector problem on ideal lattices. Just as for general lattices, we do not know of a reduction to the approximation version of the decision problem (for factors γ &gt; 1).</p><p>Proposition 8.3. For any γ and any p ∈ [1, ∞], there is a deterministic adaptive Cook reduction from K-ICVP p 1 to K-GapICVP p 1 . The reduction runs in time poly S • i∈[L] e i • N (q i ) , where S is the input size.</p><p>Proof. The advice about K needed by the reduction is the value of q, its factorization into prime ideals, and a set of coefficients for performing Chinese remaindering mod q , specifically: for every i ∈ [L], an element r i ∈ O K such that r i = 1 mod q e i i and r i ∈ q e k k for every k = i. On an instance (I, t), let v ∈ I be some closest lattice point to t. It will suffice for the reduction to compute w = v mod qI. Then we can iterate the reduction with I = qI and t = t -w, which will output w = (v -w) mod q 2 I, etc. After a polynomial number of iterations, we can reconstruct all of v ∈ I. We defer the details to the full version.</p><p>In order to compute v mod qI, the reduction will progressively find, for every i and increasing values of j up to e i , the residue v mod (q j i I). Using the final values v i = v mod (q e i i I), it will then reconstruct v mod qI using the Chinese remaindering coefficients.</p></div>
