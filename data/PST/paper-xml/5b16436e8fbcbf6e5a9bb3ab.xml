<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>User pairing in Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access (NOMA) uplink is investigated considering some predefined power allocation schemes. The base station divides the set of users into disjunct pairs and assigns the available resources to these pairs. The combinatorial problem of user pairing to achieve the maximum sum rate is analyzed in the large system limit for various scenarios, and some optimum and sub-optimum algorithms with a polynomial-time complexity are proposed. In the first scenario, 2M users and the base station have a singleantenna and communicate over M subcarriers. The performance of optimum pairing is derived for M → ∞ and shown to be superior to random pairing and orthogonal multiple access techniques. In the second setting, a novel NOMA scheme for a multi-antenna base station and single carrier communication is proposed. In this case, the users need not be aware of the pairing strategy. Furthermore, the proposed NOMA scheme is generalized to multi-antenna users. It is shown that for the considered power allocation scheme, random and optimum user pairing perform similarly in the large system limit, but optimum pairing is significantly better in finite dimensions. It is shown that NOMA with the proposed user pairing scheme outperforms a previously proposed NOMA with signal alignment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access (NOMA) has been introduced recently as one of the key technologies for the next generation of wireless networks referred to as 5G <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Compared to Orthogonal Multiple-Access (OMA) techniques, NOMA allows a larger number of users to be connected to a wireless network simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Furthermore, it has been shown that NOMA achieves a larger total throughput in both uplink and downlink of a wireless network compared to OMA techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Compared to conventional opportunistic schemes, a higher fairness is achieved by NOMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The low latency property of NOMA together with realizing a tradeoff between total throughput and fairness makes NOMA very attractive for 5G and a serious competitor for well-known Orthogonal Frquency Division Multiple-Access (OFDMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>NOMA can be done in power domain by allowing more than one user to send over a resource block <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and also in code domain by assigning different sparse codes to users, known as Sparse Code Multiple-Access (SCMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This paper is about power domain NOMA, therefore in the remaining parts of this paper, by NOMA we refer to power domain NOMA.</p><p>The idea of NOMA is based on the fact that users normally have different channel qualities and rate demands. Information theory shows that orthogonal signaling techniques are not optimum in such cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In NOMA, base stations Mohammad A. Sedaghat was with Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (e-mail: msedagha@cisco.com). Ralf R. Müller is with Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. ( e-mail: ralf.r.mueller@fau.de).</p><p>share each resource among some users with different channel qualities, and the receiver in a NOMA system uses Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to detect the transmitted signals. It is known from information theory that, for a given set of rates and users with different channel qualities, OMA methods are suboptimum with respect to required total transmit power on multiple-access channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Therefore, NOMA methods can be more power efficient than OMA methods when users with different channel qualities are grouped. Different channel qualities of the users typically result from fading and the near-far effect in cellular networks.</p><p>NOMA with randomly deployed mobile stations in downlink is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and it is shown that NOMA achieves higher ergodic sum rates compared to OMA schemes. Impact of user pairing in NOMA downlink is investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Cooperative NOMA in downlink is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> in which after the direct transmission phase, users cooperate via short range communication channels. Fairness in NOMA is investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> by studying some power allocation techniques based on instantaneous and statistical channel state information. Joint user pairing and power allocation in a multicarrier downlink channel with single-antenna users and base stations is addressed numerically in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> using some optimization techniques. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> provide a mathematical proof for the superiority of NOMA in downlink channel compared to OMA schemes from an optimization point of view. Furthermore, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, an efficient user pairing and power allocation scheme with low complexity is proposed for NOMA downlink.</p><p>In NOMA downlink, SIC should be implemented at user terminals which needs high processing power especially when the number of active users at each resource block is large. One should also consider the loss of practical SIC for large number of users <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. To this end, grouping only two users at each resource block in NOMA downlink has become more popular. In uplink, SIC is at base stations, therefore users need not be aware of the modulation and coding schemes employed by the other users. Furthermore, base stations have enough processing power to perform SIC. NOMA can also allow users to transmit in uplink in a grant-free manner which reduces latency significantly.</p><p>NOMA uplink using a sub-optimal multi-user detection technique is investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and an iterative detection and decoding scheme is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> which improves the system performance significantly. Furthermore, an iterative method for joint subcarrier and power allocation is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. NOMA in uplink for multi-cell networks is investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and resource allocation in NOMA for heterogeneous networks is analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Furthermore, optimum power allocation for some given sub-optimal user pairing schemes has been invetsigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In this paper, we choose a different stretatgy than in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> by choosing some predefined power allocation schemes and then optimizing the user pairing scheme.</p><p>Along with single-antenna applications, NOMA has been also proposed for multi-antenna wireless networks. Ergodic capacity of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) NOMA is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> by studying optimum power allocation. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> propose a new MIMO NOMA scheme by designing the precoding and detection matrices. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the number of antennas at each user terminal should be larger than the number of antennas at base stations. A more general MIMO NOMA is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> based on signal alignment for a multi-user MIMO system in which both the users and the base station are equipped with antenna arrays. It has been shown that the number of supported users in a single frequency band can be up to twice the number of antennas at the base station under some certain conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The proposed method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is applicable to both downlink and uplink. A NOMA scheme for massive MIMO with limited feedback is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> in which a massive MIMO NOMA channel is decomposed into multiple separated single-input single-output NOMA channels.</p><p>Although, user pairing and power allocation for NOMA uplink have been studied previously, to the best of our knowledge there is no analytical performance evaluation for optimum user pairing in NOMA uplink. In this paper, we answer the question how much performance improves if the users in NOMA uplink are paired optimally for the some given sub-optimal power allocation schemes. Furthermore, we show that optimal user pairing in uplink can be implemented using some algorithms with polynomial time complexity. To this end, we consider the general problem of user pairing in NOMA uplink in a cellular network with some fixed power allocation schemes. We consider the investigation of optimum joint power allocation and user pairing as a future work. At each cell, a central base station assigns the available resources including some subcarriers and spatial dimensions to some users to achieve the best performance in the sense of total rate of the users. The inter-cell interference is neglected and a single isolated cell is considered. The user terminals and the base station in the considered cell may all have multiantenna arrays. The base station first divides the users into some groups and lets the users at each group transmit over one of the subcarriers. Then, the signals at each subcarrier are detected by dividing the users, transmitting at each subcarrier, into some pairs and applying SIC to each pair.</p><p>Solving such a problem in general is very complicated. Thus, in this paper we consider various scenarios. The contributions of the paper for these scenarios are summarized as follows.</p><p>• Single antenna multiple subcarriers (SAMS): In the SAMS setting, the users and the base station are assumed to have a single-antenna. The users are divided into disjunct pairs and every subcarrier is assigned to a pair. A sub-optimum pairing algorithm with polynomial time complexity is proposed and shown to have almost the same performance as optimum method. Furthermore, a large system performance analysis of optimum pairing for the case that the users have independent and identically distributed (iid) Gaussian small scale fading coefficients at different subcarriers, is presented. It is shown that for 2M users and M subcarriers, the total rate of the system divided by M log 2 log M converges to 1 in probability as M → ∞. Furthermore, for frequency-flat channels and large M , the performance of optimum pairing is derived and compared against the performance of random pairing and time division multiple-access (TDMA) at each subcarrier. • Multiple base station antennas single subcarrier (MBASS):</p><p>-The MBASS-SAU setting is the case of a multiantenna base station and single-antenna users (SAU).</p><p>We consider one single subcarrier and investigate the performance of optimum spatial dimension assignment. The base station divides the users into pairs and detects every pair using SIC. It is shown that the optimum pairing method has significant performance gain compared to random pairing in finite dimensions. We show that optimum assignment in this case can be implemented in polynomial time using the Hungarian algorithm with a modified cost matrix. Furthermore, a large system analysis of optimum pairing method is presented and it is shown that when the number of users and the number of antennas at the base station are large, the performances of both optimum and random pairing converge to the same limit. -Motivated by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the case of multi-antenna users (MAU) is considered as the MBASS-MAU setting. A new polynomial time NOMA scheme is proposed in which the users need not know the user pairing strategy and the base station pairs the users based on channel state information. It is shown that, unlike to NOMA with signal alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, there are no requirements on the ranks of the channels and the number of antennas at the user terminals. Furthermore, the users only need to know their own channel. We show that the proposed method has better performance than NOMA with signal alignment. We use bold lowercase letters for vectors and bold uppercase letters for matrices. Conjugate transpose of a matrix is denoted by • † and the transpose itself is shown by • T . The identity matrix is shown by I. Moreover, the real and complex sets are shown by R and C, respectively. The determinant is denoted by det(•), p -→ denotes the convergence in probability and x p ≤ y implies that the random variable x is less than or equal to y with probability 1. Furthermore, a ∼ CN(µ, σ 2 ) means that a is a complex Gaussian random variable with mean µ and variance σ 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>A multi-user wireless cellular network with a central base station at each cell is considered. For sake of analysis, we consider one individual cell and neglect the inter-cell interference. We assume that the base station in the considered cell has N antennas and there are M subcarriers available for the communication between the users and the base station. Each subcarrier is assigned to K users simultaneously, thus the total number of users is M K. It is assumed that each user has L antennas.</p><p>Throughout the whole paper, we consider the uplink channel. It is assumed that the base station is able to do SIC which is explained in Definition 1 for a simple setting.</p><p>Definition 1: Let x 1 and x 2 be the iid Gaussian signals of two single-antenna users with transmit power P 1 and P 2 , respectively. Assume that a receiver with N antennas knows the codebooks of both users and the received signal at the receiver is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y = h 1 x 1 + h 2 x 2 + n,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>for some known channel vectors h 1 , h 2 and the additive white Gaussian noise n ∼ CN(0, σ 2 n I). The receiver can first detect and decode the signal of one of the users using a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detector and then cancel it from the received signal and detect the signal of the other user. We call this well-known detection method SIC throughout this paper. From information theory, the maximum total rate is obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">log 2 (1 + h1 2 P1+ h2 2 P2 σ 2 n ) [28].</formula><p>In this paper, we assume that only two of the users use any resource. The case of more than two users will be considered in future works. For given rates on the multiple-access channel with two users, the total transmit power is minimized if the base station first detects the user with the stronger channel and then the user with the weaker channel.</p><p>The fundamental problem of NOMA is how to assign the available resources to the users. In the considered network, the available resources are the subcarriers and the spatial dimensions obtained from the MIMO nature of the system. We analyze such a problem in the SAMS setting in Sections III and IV for frequency-selective and frequency-flat fading, respectively. In Sections V and VI, we address the MBASS-SAU and MBASS-MAU setting, respectively.</p><p>In this paper a single cell uplink channel is considered in which several users are distributed within the cell around the base station. To model the path loss of the users, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, we assume that the users are uniformly distributed in a disc with radius R d and the base station is at the center of the disc. The shadowing effect is neglected in this paper. The small scale fading coefficients are assumed to be iid Gaussian distributed, and the path loss of kth user is modeled as<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r 2 0 +r 2 k</formula><p>where r k is the distance between the kth user and the base station and r 0 is a constant to avoid singularity 1 .</p><p>Although the proposed schemes in this paper can be applied to an uplink channel with any power allocation strategy, we limit the numerical and simulation results to two types of power control methods for the user terminals. One is when the users set their power proportional to the inverse of their path loss. In this case, the power multiplied by the path loss for all the users is equal to a constant. We call this method Inverse power control (IPC). The second method is when the users transmit with the same power independent of their path loss which is called the equal power (EP) method in the sequel. Investigating optimum joint power allocation and user pairing in NOMA uplink analytically is an interesting future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SAMS IN FREQUENCY-SELECTIVE FADING</head><p>In this section, we consider the problem of assigning each of the M subcarriers to two single-antenna users when the base station has a single antenna, i.e., K = 2, N = 1 and L = 1. Thus, there are 2M users in total. Assume without loss of generality that the ℓ 2m-1 th and the ℓ 2m th user are selected to transmit on the mth subcarrier. The received signal at the base station for the mth subcarrier is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y m = d ℓ2m-1 h ℓ2m-1,m x ℓ2m-1,m + d ℓ2m h ℓ2m,m x ℓ2m + n m , (2)</formula><p>where d i , h i,j ∼ CN(0, 1) and x i,j model the path loss, the small scale fading and the transmitted signal of the ith user at the jth subcarrier, respectively, and n m is additive white Gaussian noise with variance σ 2 n . It is assumed that the path loss of each user is identical at different subcarriers, but the fast fading coefficients differ. The signals of the users are assumed to be independent and Gaussian distributed. Let P i be the transmit power of the ith user which is selected prior to the subcarrier assignment according to a power allocation method. Furthermore, it is assumed that the base station knows the d i s and h i,j s perfectly. Note that in general, power and subcarrier allocation can be done jointly. However, in this paper we assume that the power allocation is given beforehand.</p><p>At the beginning of each transmission interval, the base station determines the optimum pairing based on the channel information. We assume that during each transmission interval d i s and h i,j s are constant. Thus, the transmission interval must be shorter than the coherence time of the channel.</p><p>The base station applies SIC to detect the signals with the sum rate</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R m (ℓ 2m-1 , ℓ 2m ) △ = log 2 1 + |h ℓ2m-1,m | 2 d ℓ2m-1 P ℓ2m-1 + |h ℓ2m,m | 2 d ℓ2m P ℓ2m-1 σ 2 n ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>at the mth subcarrier. For such a setting, the optimum user pairing is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Π opt = argmax (ℓ2m-1,ℓ2m)∈Π M m=1 R m (ℓ 2m-1 , ℓ 2m ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where Π models all the possible pairing sets. Π opt denotes the optimal pairing scheme which gives the maximum sum rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A sub-optimum algorithm with polynomial time complexity</head><p>The total number of pairing sets is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(2M )! 2 M</formula><p>which can be approximated using Stirling's approximation as √ 4πM</p><p>√ 2M e</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2M</head><p>. As observed, the total number of sets grows superexponential with M , thus the optimum solution is not feasible to calculate even for moderate M . To simplify the problem, we use the bounds provided in the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 1: R m is bounded by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1 2 log 2 1 + 2 |h ℓ2m-1,m | 2 d ℓ2m-1 P ℓ2m-1 σ 2 n + 1 2 log 2 1 + 2 |h ℓ2m,m | 2 d ℓ2m P ℓ2m σ 2 n ≤ R m (ℓ 2m-1 , ℓ 2m ) ≤ log 2 1 + |h ℓ2m-1,m | 2 d ℓ2m-1 P ℓ2m-1 σ 2 n + log 2 1 + |h ℓ2m,m | 2 d ℓ2m P ℓ2m σ 2 n . (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>Proof: The lower bound can be easily proven using the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means. In fact, the lower bound is achievable using TDMA and the upper bound is the case that there is no interference between the users. The bounds become tight in the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) regime. Assuming that the ℓ 2m-1 th and the ℓ 2m th user transmit at the mth subcarrier, the main advantage of the bounds provided in Lemma 1 is that they follow the general form</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">g ℓ2m-1,m + g ℓ2m,m ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>in which the contribution of the users in the sum rate can be decoupled. g i,j approximately represents the contribution of jth user in the sum rate at the ith subcarrier. Using any of the bounds in Lemma 1 as an approximation for R m (ℓ 2m-1 , ℓ 2m ), we can solve the optimization problem in (4) in polynomial time according to the following lemma. Lemma 2: Assume the pairing problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">max (ℓ2m-1,ℓ2m)∈Π M m=1 g ℓ2m-1,m + g ℓ2m,m ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">m ∈ {1, • • • , M }, ℓ i ∈ {1, • • • , 2M</formula><p>} and Π models all the pairing sets. The optimization problem can be solved optimally using the Hungarian algorithm with a polynomial time complexity. Proof: To convert the problem to a minimization problem, we define ĝi,j</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">△ = max k,n g k,n -g i,j .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>It can be easily shown that the solution pairs of the problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">min (ℓ2m-1,ℓ2m)∈Π M m=1 ĝℓ2m-1,m + ĝℓ2m,m ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>are the same as the solution pairs of the original problem. Furthermore, ĝi,j ≥ 0. Next, define Z ∈ R 2M ×M such that its (i, j)th entry is equal to ĝi,j . To obtain the optimal pairs, we can solve an equivalent problem which is a linear assignment problem with the cost matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Z t △ = [Z Z].</formula><p>The problem is the same problem as the job-worker problem in which we have 2M workers and M jobs and we want to assign each job to two workers. To solve such a problem, we copy the cost matrix Z for M new virtual jobs and minimize the cost by assigning each job to one worker exclusively. Finally, the workers assigned to the ith job and the (i + M )th virtual job will be assigned to ith job which means two workers per job.</p><p>This linear assignment problem can be solved optimaly using the Hungarian algorithm with a polynomial time complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The complexity of the Hungarian algorithm in this case is O(M 3 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> Due to the lack of space here we omit to explain the Hungarian algorithm. To see the details of the Hungarian algorithm, some simple examples and also an online demo video, please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Lemma 2 gives a sub-optimum algorithm for the user pairing problem. To derive the performance of this suboptimum method, first we derive the optimum set to maximize the lower bound or the upper bound in Lemma 1, and then we calculate the sum rate for this given set.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Large system analysis</head><p>In this subsection, we analyze the NOMA scheme presented in the previous subsection in the large system limit, i.e., N, K → ∞ and constant α △ = K/N . The goal is to calculate the eigenvalues λ m,1 and λ m,2 in the large system limit. We confine the analysis to the case of IPC and leave the case of EP for future works. For IPC, we show that optimum user pairing performs identical to random pairing in the large system limit. However, in the results section, we demonstrate that for finite K, N , optimum user pairing performs much better than random pairing. Furthermore, in the results section, using computer simulation we show that the same behavior is observed for EP.</p><p>For IPC, we set P i = 1/d i . Therefore, the path loss effect is canceled out.

However, in finite sizes, in the numerical results section we show that optimum user pairing achieves higher total rate than random pairing. We conjecture that the gain of optimal pairing in NOMA remains in the large system limit if the size of the groups scales with K. In such a case, interference cancellation with higher steps is required.</p><p>VI. MBASS-MAU SCENARIO Consider the case that all user terminals and the base station have multi-antenna arrays. Each user has L antennas and the number of antennas at the base station is N . It is assumed that all the K users communicate with the base station over a single subcarrier. For such an uplink channel, a NOMA scheme using a signal alignment technique is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> in which the users are divided into K/2 pairs. Then, the inter-pair interference is mitigated using a combination of beamforming at the user terminals and linear detection at the base station if K ≤ 2N &lt; 4L and the channels between the users and the base station are full rank. The base station then applies SIC for every pair. It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that this NOMA system can be decomposed into K/2 orthogonal single-antenna NOMA systems.</p><p>In this section, we use the same method introduced in the last section to propose a new NOMA uplink scheme in which each user terminal uses a beamforming vector to transmit a single data stream. We show that this method has higher performance than the NOMA scheme with signal alignment proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Furthermore, in contrast to the scheme with signal alignment, in our scheme users only need to know their own channel.</p><p>Assume that the kth user sends the data stream u k by applying the beamforming vector b k ∈ C L×1 . The received vector at the base station reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">y = K k=1 G k b k u k + n, (<label>39</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_63">)</formula><p>where G k is the channel matrix between the kth user and the base station. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, full rank channel matrices and 2L &gt; N are assumed to guarantee a user pairing solution. We show that none of these assumptions are required for the method introduced in this section. Note that we have already shown in the previous section that this NOMA method works even for single-antenna users.</p><p>It is assumed that the users only know their own channel and the base station knows all the channel matrices. We use a simple beamforming method at the user terminals and leave the optimum beamforming strategy for the future works. The mth user sets</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">b m = v m ,<label>(40)</label></formula><p>where v m is the eigenvector of G † m G m which corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue. Letting</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">H △ = [G 1 b 1 , . . . , G K b K ]<label>(41)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">u △ = [u 1 , . . . , u K ] T ,<label>(42)</label></formula><p>the received signal at the base station is</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">y = Hu + n.<label>(43)</label></formula><p>Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_67">43</ref>) describes the same channel model as in the case of single-antenna user terminals. Thus, we apply the same detection technique as described in the previous section to pair the users for the case of K = 2N . The optimum user pairing set can be obtained using the Hungarian algorithm. Note that in this NOMA scheme, the channel matrices are not required to be full rank. Furthermore, L can be any integer. In the numerical results section, we compare this method against the NOMA scheme with signal alignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. NUMERICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>In this section, some numerical results for NOMA with the proposed user pairing schemes explained in the previous sections are presented. The cell is assumed to be a disc with radius of R d = 100 and r 0 is set to 1. Both the IPC and EQ strategies are considered. We define the average transmit power of the users as</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">P △ = E P i ,<label>(44)</label></formula><p>and the average path loss of the users as</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">d △ = E d i .<label>(45)</label></formula><p>To have a fair comparison, we use the parameter</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">γ △ = d P σ 2 n</formula><p>as a measure for SNR at the receiver. Note that γ is different than E γ i . We do not use the measure E γ i = E d i P i /σ 2 n for SNR since the power of the users appears with the weight of the path loss coefficients in it.</p><p>Besides the results which are obtained from analytical formulas, all the rates are derived using expectation over both the users' positions in the cell and the small scale fading coefficients. Note that the shadowing effect is neglected here. The rates are calculated using computer simulation with enough samples.</p><p>As a reference for comparison, an orthogonal method based on TDMA is used in which the ith user is assigned ζ i portion of the total time at a given subcarrier. We consider two TDMA cases: 1) when the users at each subcarrier are assigned ζ i = 1/K portion of the total time, 2) when ζ i s are optimized for all the subcarriers.</p><p>To measure the fairness in different scenarios, we use the Jain index given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> Jain's fairness index</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">= M K k=1 R k 2 M K M K k=1 R 2 k ,<label>(46)</label></formula><p>which is between 0 and 1. Note that the maximum fairness is obtained when all the rates are equal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. SAMS in frequency-selective fading</head><p>We present the results for the sub-optimum user pairing method introduced in Section III. Note that the results here are lower bounds for the total rate, since we have used the suboptimum user pairing methods based on the bounds in Lemma 1. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the total rate of the users normalized by M log 2 (1 + 2γ log M ) for M = 10 versus γ. It is observed that in both the EP and IPC cases, the proposed pairing methods perform much better than random pairing. The results for the pairing methods based on the first and the second bound in Lemma 1 are almost the same. Thus, in the remaining figures, we only consider the method based on the first bound. It is also observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> that the NOMA scheme with EP has a better performance than the one with IPC. The reason is that for IPC, the users compensate the path losses, hence the received powers of the users at the base station differ less and accordingly the gain of NOMA reduces. Another observation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is that for the case of γ → ∞, the normalized total rate converges to 1 which confirms the predictions of Section III.</p><p>Next, we investigate the total rate versus the number of subcarriers. γ is set to 5 dB. The total rates normalized by M log 2 log M are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The results in both cases converge to 1 very slowly. Note that the low convergence rate is due to the terms containing log 2 log M in the normalized total rate. The results for random pairing are also plotted. As observed, the normalized total rates for random pairing converge to 0 since the total rates in this case scale with M . As for the previous figure, the EP method performs better than IPC.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we compare the NOMA scheme with two OMA schemes based on TDMA which achieves the same set of rates. M is set to 10. The required total power normalized by the total power of the NOMA scheme is selected as performance measure. This measure shows how much power each method requires to reach the same rate sets as in the NOMA scheme. It is observed that the NOMA schemes are much more power efficient than the two OMA schemes. Note that the NOMA scheme does not need any time management which is very critical in the case of the TDMA method with optimum ζ i .  Furthermore, it is observed that the TDMA methods require more power in the EP case.</p><p>Next, we plot the Jain fairness index versus the number of sub-carriers for different scenarios. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. As observed, the proposed pairing method performs much better in terms of fairness than random pairing method. Furthermore, IPC performs better than EP which is in fact clear because in IPC the path loss is compensated by power control. The main message of this figure is that our proposed user pairing method not only increases the sum rate but also improves fairness in comparison to random pairing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. SAMS in frequency-flat fading</head><p>In this subsection, the results for the case of frequencyflat channels in Section IV are presented. We compare the performance of optimum pairing against random pairing. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> for γ = 15 dB and the EP case. The simulation results together with the analytical results M → ∞ are plotted. It is observed that optimum pairing has better performance than random pairing. As a benchmark, the results for full interference cancellation are also plotted which is, in fact, the ergodic capacity per user. In this method, all the users transmit on all subcarriers and the base station uses full interference cancellation. It is easy to show that in such a case for M → ∞, the ergodic capacity per user converges to Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>: The rate per user of optimum and random user pairing for SAMS in frequency-flat fading, the EP method and γ = 15 dB. The ergodic capacity per user, which is achieved when the full interference cancellation is used, is also plotted. 2 log 2 (1 + 2γ) ≈ 3. From Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the rate per user of NOMA with optimum pairing is worse than the ergodic capacity per user. Note, however, that NOMA with interference cancellation has much lower complexity than full interference cancellation.</p><p>Next, we plot the analytical results for M → ∞ versus γ for optimum and random pairing in both the EP and IPC case. The results are given in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. It is observed that optimum pairing performs about 1 dB better than random pairing for both EP and IPC. The EP method performs about 2.5 dB better than the IPC method at around γ = 10 dB. As a benchmark, the ergodic capacities of EP and of IPC are also plotted. The EP method with optimum pairing looses about 4 dB compared to the ergodic capacity. For the IPC method, optimum pairing falls only little behind the ergodic capacity.</p><p>We also compare the performance of the NOMA scheme using optimum user pairing against the TDMA schemes in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. The number of subcarriers is set to M = 10. The normalized required total power to achieve the same set of rates as in the NOMA scheme are plotted versus SNR. The TDMA schemes with ζ i = 0.5 require much higher power compared to the case of NOMA. This extra power for EP is much larger than for IPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS</head><p>In this paper, NOMA uplink was considered and optimal user pairing was discussed in various settings. For singleantenna base stations and user terminals communicating over M subcarriers with optimal user pairing, it was shown that the total rate scales with M log 2 log M if the users have iid small scale fading coefficients. For frequency-flat channels over the subcarriers, the optimal user pairing method was analyzed in the large system limit and shown to be a bit better than random pairing. In both cases, two orthogonal methods were compared against NOMA, and it was shown that the power efficiency of NOMA is much higher than the efficiencies of the orthogonal schemes. Furthermore, a novel NOMA scheme for the case of multi-antenna base stations was proposed in which the user terminals transmit over a single subcarrier. It was shown that optimum user pairing can be implemented by means of the Hungarian algorithm with polynomial complexity. The results for multi-antenna users were compared against NOMA based on signal alignment. It was shown that a significant performance gain can be achieved.</p><p>In this paper, the power allocation was assumed to be fixed for the user terminals. Extending the results of this paper to the case of joint user pairing and power allocation can be interesting future work. One possible approach is to iterate user pairing and power allocation. Another problem for future is the joint assignment of subcarrier and spatial dimension. Furthermore, the methods in this paper were based on perfect channel state information. Investigating the effect of imperfect channel state information and extending the results to the case of user pairing based on large scale fading coefficients for the sake of complexity reduction can be interesting future works.</p></div>

This means that we first select the two best users for the first subcarrier and then excluding this two users we select the best two users for the second subcarrier and continue this procedure up to the end. In fact, for the mth subcarrier, we select the best two users among 2(M -m+1) users. Let η 2m-1 and η 2m denote the indices of the first and the second selected user, respectively, at the mth subcarrier. Using a similar method as in the previous subsection, it can be shown that for all 2(M -m + 1) where m = νM and ν ∈ (0, 1] is a nonvanishing constant, both </p><p>Furthermore, since m ≤ M in the summation, the limit is less than or equal to 1.
