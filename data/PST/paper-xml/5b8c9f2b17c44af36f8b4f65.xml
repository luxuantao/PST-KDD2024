<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Detecting and classifying cardiac arrhythmias is critical to the diagnosis of patients with cardiac abnormalities. In this paper, a novel approach based on deep learning methodology is proposed for the classification of single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. We demonstrate the application of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and deep belief networks (DBN) for ECG classification following detection of ventricular and supraventricular heartbeats using single-lead ECG. The effectiveness of this proposed algorithm is illustrated using real ECG signals from the widely-used MIT-BIH database. Simulation results demonstrate that with a suitable choice of parameters, RBM and DBN can achieve high average recognition accuracies of ventricular ectopic beats (93.63%) and of supraventricular ectopic beats (95.57%) at a low sampling rate of 114 Hz. Experimental results indicate that classifiers built into this deep learning-based framework achieved state-of-the art performance models at lower sampling rates and simple features when compared to traditional methods. Further, employing features extracted at a sampling rate of 114 Hz when combined with deep learning provided enough discriminatory power for the classification task. This performance is comparable to that of traditional methods and uses a much lower sampling rate and simpler features. Thus, our proposed deep neural network algorithm demonstrates that deep learning-based</p></div>

An inexpensive and noninvasive technique to detect these disorders is by analyzing electrocardiograms (ECGs) that furnish valuable information on the electrophysiology and functional aspects of the cardiovascular system.</p><p>In past decades, computerized recognition of ECGs has become a wellestablished practice, assisting cardiologists in the task of classifying long-term ECG recordings.

However, these state of-the-art automatic ECG recognition systems often rely on a pattern-matching framework that represents an ECG signal as a sequence of stochastic patterns, so they require complex feature extraction process and high sampling rates and thus burdensome computational times to classify arrhythmias. Consequently, to enable implementation in real time and at reasonable cost, these systems must enlarge their classification criteria by using a set of simple features and a lower sampling rate.</p><p>Though several algorithms have focused on automatically classifying heartbeats in ECGs, another drawback is the scalability failure to handle large intraclass variations wherein the robustness of many existing ECG classification techniques remains limited. A major limitation of above approaches is that they are highly dependent on the supervised trained dataset and perform poorly while dealing with large amount of unknown ECG records. Furthermore, extracting complex features in the transform domains when combined with dimensionality reduction algorithms significantly upsurge the computational complexity of the overall process. This limits the usage of such complicated feature-extraction frameworks in low power applications such as wearable health monitoring devices or mobile applications. Moreover, the classifier algorithms have not performed well in practice in case of inter-patient variations of the ECG signals, thereby demonstrating a common shortcoming of having an inconsistent performance while classifying a new patients ECG signal. This makes them unreliable to be widely used clinically or in practice, as they tend to have high variations in their accuracy and efficiency for larger databases.</p><p>Deep learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> (also known as unsupervised feature learning or representation learning) is a new technique that is becoming mainstream in machine learning and pattern recognition.

Deep learning networks are implemented using stacked autoencoders and can represent a highly expressive abstraction. Such abstractions can compactly represent a much larger set of functions than shallow networks can.

For each patient, an individual and simple CNN was trained by using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, and such patient-specific feature extraction ability did provide an improvement in the classification performance. This did negate the necessity to extract handcrafted manual features, but since a dedicated CNN is trained for a particular patient, it can solely be used to only classify a specific patients long ECG data stream in an accurate manner making it practically unscalable for large number of users.</p><p>Kutlu <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> performed a multi-stage classification system for two lead ECG using considerable number of features(106 ECG waveform features) and a Deep Belief Network (DBN) as classifier to overcome the disadvantage of having a cumbersome network with no physiology interpretation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methodology</head><p>A pattern recognition system provides a framework that automatically maps an input signal to a class label by analyzing the features extracted from the signal. The two symbolic stages of this recognition system are feature extraction and classification. Before feature extraction, the data is pre-processed (i.e., filtered), detected and segmented. Then, feature extraction uses mathematical techniques on the input signal to build an association with known models and to obtain the best discriminative representation of the data by exploiting the underlying signal characteristics. Each stage is described below [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Preprocesing</head><p>Each ECG signal is first bandpass filtered at 0.11 Hz and sampled at 360 Hz. It is preprocessed to remove artifacts, such as baseline wander, power-line interference, high-frequency noise, and motion artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Baseline wander is a low frequency artifact that may be caused by chest-lead ECG signals suffering from coughing or breathing with large chest movements, by poor electrode to skin contact, or by limb-lead ECG signals suffering from arm or leg movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To remove baseline wander, we pass the signal through median filters with window sizes of 200ms and 600ms, thus removing P-waves, QRS complexes, This strong interference can stem from improper grounding, loose contact of a patient's cable, or disconnected electrodes. Power-line interference and highfrequency noise are removed from a baseline-corrected ECG using a 12-tap lowpass filter, a finite impulse response filter that has 3 dB at 35 Hz and equal ripple in both pass and stop bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Motion artifacts represent transient baseline interference that is introduced by electrode skin impedance caused by electrode motion. Because the peak amplitude of a motion artifact is 500 percent of the peak-to-peak ECG amplitude, and its duration is about 100-500 ms, these artifacts can obscure ECG waveforms, making their interpretation quite difficult.</p></div>

Hence, we adopted the motion artifacts removal approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> wherein adaptive filters altered their filter coefficients with the continuous change of signal using adaptive algorithms, providing the optimum noise removal features for non-stationary signals like ECG.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HeartBeat Detection</head><p>The heartbeat detection is accomplished at a lower sampling rate of 114Hz as compared to the input sampling rate of 360Hz. We followed the filterbank based approach enumerated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> for ECG detection algorithm wherein the Filterbanks subbands are downsampled and components of the one-channel detection block like the feature computation, MWI, and peak detector are operated at a lower rate than the input sampling rate of the ECG. The adoption of filter bank enables the analysis of multiple frequency bands very efficiently. This results in competent heartbeat detection at subband rate along with high computational efficiency. For R-peak detection at subband rate, it is crucial to have a deterministic relationship between fiducial points in the input ECG and the subband signal. This requires that each of the analysis and synthesis filters have a linear phase response as the linear phase requirement ensures that all frequencies in the input signal will have the same sample delay through the analysis filters.</p><p>It is then possible to determine the exact location of the R wave in the input ECG signal, and other fiducial points from analysis of the subbands, thereby resulting in accurate R peak detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> </p></div>

For segmentation, we utilize the heartbeat segmentation program of Laguna et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> since the accuracy of this system in determining heartbeat segmentation points has been validated on the MIT-BIH database and has proven to be commensurate with the inter-expert variation. The heartbeat segmentation stage provides QRS </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T-wave offset detection</head><p>T wave is the representation of repolarization of ventricles through which the myocardium is prepared for the next ECG cycle. In the automatic delineation process of the ECG i.e the process of locating the onset and offset of different waveforms, one of the most critical calculations is the detection of T wave ends, particularly T offset. The detection of the T offset is the most challenging among the ECG fiducial points, primarily due to the slow transition of the signal near the end of T wave and due to the presence of oscillatory patterns that vary from one person to another. We use the proposed method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> , which is based on ECG signal filtering, value estimation of different fiducial points and application of backward and forward search windows with adaptive thresholds.</p><p>For an infallible detection of T waveform and its fiducial points (e.g. T onset, T peak, and T offset), the first step is to define the search window in the entitled signal. The boundaries of the T wave search window are set to be adaptive and relative to the position of QRS offset and RR interval wherein the search window encloses the T wave boundaries, extended from the QRS offset to two-third of previous RR interval. A small segment post the QRS offset is excluded from the search window due to the fact that T wave does not exist immediately after QRS offset and occurs only after the ST segment.</p><p>The next stage is the adaptive threshold estimation wherein the position of T peak is registered by finding either the local maximum and the local minimum in the entitled ECG signal within the search window and the threshold is calculated using the previous T and R peak level values. The threshold is used to classify the morphology of the T wave present in each heartbeat. For eg: if the</p></div>

For a negative monophasic T wave, the absolute minimum value must meet the defined requirement in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. In case of a biphasic T wave, both the local maximum and the absolute value of the local minimum should be greater than the threshold. For cases when T wave is not detected in the first attempt, the threshold is then decreased by half and the search method is done over again until a T peak is detected. Furthermore, the detection algorithm traces the onset and offset T values by finding the sample corresponding to the zero slope of the entitled ECG signal. The sample point which has a zero slope and former T peak is identified as T onset. Similarly, T offset is determined at a further distance of T peak as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p></div>

Feature Set 2 (FS2) produced 22 features consisting of RR intervals and fixed interval morphologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.

RBMs belong to category of Markov Random Field (MRF) which constitutes an visible layer corresponding to the input layer and a hidden layer corresponding to the latent feature representation. The connections between the nodes are bidirectional, so given an input vector one can obtain the latent feature representation and also vice versa. Training of the individual layers is done in an unsupervised manner and final fine-tuning is performed by adding a linear classifier to the top layer of the DBN and performing a supervised optimization. The ECG classification community has taken notice of these pivotal developments and a recent work [39] introduced a restricted Boltzmann machine learning algorithm for two-lead heart beat classification wherein the unsupervised learning algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machine helped in mining the large set of unlabelled ECG wave beats in the heart healthcare monitoring ap-M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT plications. Wang and Shang [45] used DBN to automatically extract features from raw unlabeled physiological two-lead ECG data. For the automatic clas-85 sification ECG signals, one can find the solution proposed in [46] based on the combination DBN and SVM. In particular, DBN was used for feature learning and the obtained features are fed to SVM for training and classification. Rahlal et al. [40] while also performing ECG classification using deep neural network (DNN) didn't use complex features but used stacked denoising autoencoders 90 (SDAEs) for suitable feature representation from the raw two -lead ECG data. Zubair et al. [43] used CNN with 44 recordings of ECG signals obtained from MIT-BIH database. They extracted R-peak ECG beat patterns for the training of the three-layer CNN. They achieved 92.70% accuracy in detecting the ECG beats into their respective classes (normal, fusion beat, supraventricular ectopic 95 beat, unknown beat, and ventricular ectopic beat).</figDesc></figure>

Nine samples of the ECG between FP-50ms and FP+100ms were extracted from this window. The second window approximately covered the T-wave and started at 150 ms and finished at 500 ms. The next nine samples between FP+150ms and FP+500ms were extracted from the second window, for a total of 18 features used in FS2.[Figure2b] So in totality, the feature sets can be defined as the combination of the following: Feature Set1 (FS1)<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>: RR intervals (4), heartbeat intervals (3), segmented morphology<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> • Feature Set1 (FS2)<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>: RR intervals (4), fixed interval morphology<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> An extensive statistical Hypothesis testing experimentation was performed to define these feature sets. The Hypothesis testing results indicated that segmented morphology features, heart-beat interval features and RR Interval features change significantly for SVEB arrhythmia case as compared to VEB and non-arrhythmia class. Due to the robustness of these features to distinguish between SVEB and remaining classes, these features constituted our Feature Set 1. The test also revealed that Fixed Interval Morphology and RR Intervals alter significantly for the VEB arrhythmia samples and hence constituted our Feature Set 2. In addition to Hypothesis testing, we also performed the multi-collinearity test which included a pair-wise correlation and found that multi-collinearity was not a problem in case of RBM-DBN model as the paired t test revealed that the predictors are not correlated with other predictors in the model. Thus, the entire feature extraction can be summarized as follows: Pre-RR Interval • Post-RR Interval RR Intervals • Average-RR Interval • Local avg -RR Interval • QRS Duration (QRS offset-QRS onset) Heartbeat Intervals • T-wave duration(T-wave offset-QRS offset) • P wave flag Segmented Morphology Intervals • ECG morphology (10 samples) between QRS onset and QRS offset of lead A • ECG morphology (9 samples) between QRS offset and T-wave offset of lead A Fixed Interval Morphology • ECG morphology (10 samples) between FP-50ms to FP + 100ms of lead A • ECG morphology (9 samples) between FP + 150ms to FP + 500ms of lead A</figDesc></figure>

As future work, we will investigate other types of embedding that represent ECG recordings as a feature vector and then use hierarchical deep learning algorithms for robust performance. We would also like to integrate Restricted Boltzmann Machines with ensemble based/Bagging approachto construct multiple individual classifiers. Considering the fact that both deep learning and ensemble learning have leverage in constructing complicated nonlinear functions, the combination of the two frameworks can better handle hard artificial intelligence tasks. We will also extend our framework to the classification of sensor-based cognitive assessment data and the recognition of daily life activities, areas important in healthcare for ubiquitous health computing and medical informatics.</p></div>			</div>
