<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The focal point of this investigation is a result of Montague <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, whose customary interpretation as an argument in favor of modal logics for belief and knowledge as opposed to a classical first-order approach, I challenge. (For other responses to Montague, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.) I shall argue that modal logics are on no firmer ground than first-order logics when equally endowed with substitutive self-reference. Both modal and first-order treatments of knowledge and belief for commonsense reasoning can readily lead to inconsistencies. Yet there still may be remedies, depending on the particular forms of commonsense reasoning (and specifically of auto-epistemic reasoning) considered)</p><p>Let us write Bel(x) and Know(x) to indicate that x is believed, respectively known, by an implicit agent g. The syntactic status of x is one of the issues to be addressed. If Bel and Know are predicate symbols, then x is an ordinary first-order term which in particular may be the name of a sentence. 2 On the * This is a sequel to the paper "Languages with Self-Reference I: Foundations", Artificial Intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref>(3) (1985) 301-322.</p><p>An earlier version of this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposed remedies along somewhat different lines, that I now feel to be of less generality and usefulness.</p><p>2 See <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for an early call for naming, or reification, in AI.</p><p>other hand, if Bel and Know are modal operators, then x will be a well-formed formula. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> it was suggested that for an intelligent reasoner g, a self-referential language is desirable in order to represent (to g itself) such notions as that g has a false belief. We may write, for instance, (3x)(Bel(x) &amp; -TTrue(x)) .</p><p>But if this very wff is a belief of g, then it too can serve (either in quoted first-order form, or in formula--modal--form) as an argument within another belief formula. I have contended <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> that this is such a basic aspect of language and thought that any reasonable representational mechanism for commonsense reasoning must include facilities for expression of self-reference and syntactic substitutions. We will see that this has significant consequences regarding consistency and modal treatments, in that apparent advantages of the latter over nonmodal ("syntactic") ones disappear in the presence of selfreference. Now, the theorems of a proposed theory S for beliefs of an agent g can be viewed as themselves being the conclusions held by g, so that S is thought of as g's own reasoning context. Alternatively S can be viewed as the theory of someone, h, other than g, who is reasoning about g's conclusions. In the former case, g will be able to reason about g's own conclusions, and in the latter h may reason about g's reasoning about g's own conclusions. Of course, even more complex scenarios are possible, and have been considered in the literature, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. In any case, such conclusions by g amount to beliefs of g. This will play a key role in our analysis.</p><p>A variety of theories has been considered for the study of belief and knowledge, many of them modal. $5, to be presented below, is perhaps the most famous of these. For now, 1 simply observe that $5 and other similar theories (modal or classical first-order) are very limited as theories of epistemic behavior of intelligent agents. In effect, they view knowledge (or belief) fixed once and for all in a timeless world; there are no processes, no mistakes, no guesses, no decisions, no plans, no goals, no new information. This is understandable: the idea here and elsewhere in formal studies has been to get a simple view right first, before turning to the complexities of real reasoning.</p><p>Still, the thrust of these theories has been one of deduction, that is, of additional beliefs an agent should come to, given certain original beliefs. There is in this an underlying, if not explicit, notion of process. While at times such complexities can be safely ignored for the sake of simplicity of analysis, at other times the very analysis can be impeded by such limitations. The more complex problem of real-time on-going reasoning actually suggests key ideas about the nature of knowledge and belief that cannot easily be seen from the more restricted idealized view. This will emerge in Sections 6 and 7. While we will not here endorse an explicitly process-oriented formalization of knowledge and belief, the underlying idea of process will serve in our analyses. Key to this is the idea that an agent's set of beliefs may change over time.</p><p>Montague and Thomason showed that certain apparently plausible formalizations of the concepts of knowledge and belief have turned out to be internally inconsistent. I will recall some of these results here, and supply still more. Does this mean we must surrender formalism altogether, and look only at heuristic algorithms? I do not think so. Some of our results (Theorems 6.2 and 7.2) and an Open Problem point in directions that may be fruitful. What perhaps should be concluded is that timeless approaches may not be a good way to study knowledge and belief, or at least that timeless theories should be formulated with an eye to an underlying temporal framework.</p><p>My examination of formalizations of the propositional attitudes of belief and knowledge will lead to a distinction between two rather different kinds of theory I shall call "static" and "dynamic." To offer a brief preview, I call attention to the highly introspective feature present in theories of belief and knowledge. These are, largely, theories of self-belief and self-knowledge. That is, reasoning is specified so as to allow conclusions like Bel ~ or Know a from already having concluded ~, and so on, in a succession of "layers." This layering however has been collapsed in most formalisms into a single flattened sea of conclusions. In the next section, I indicate in intuitive terms why this is suspect in general. Later sections give technical difficulties and potential solutions still within a flattened context. Roughly, dynamic theories, although flattened, are devised to take account of the (implicit) layers in a way congenial to commonsense reasoning, while static theories are not.</p><p>To set the stage for the rest of this paper, I briefly comment on the nature of knowledge and how it contrasts with that of belief. Indeed, the differences seem striking. Whereas knowledge is firmly tied to the notion of truth (as evidenced in the first-order schema Know('a')-+ ~), that of belief is another matter entirely. In fact, knowledge has at times been characterized as simply true belief (or alternatively as justified true belief; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). In any case, there need be no presumption at all in agent h that a sentence believed by agent g is for that reason true. It may be true or false, and h's calling a sentence o-a belief of g distinctly raises the possibility of ~r being false. That is not to say, however, that the agent g believing the sentence ~r regards cr as anything but true.</p><p>Here I am taking the word "belief" in the (admittedly imprecise) sense of g's very definitely believing o-to be true, rather than merely suspecting o-to be true (as in "I believe so"). It may seem advisable to regard the beliefs of an agent g as simply some set or other of wffs. For some purposes this is too lax an approach; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for a suggested narrowing of the definition of belief. However, as with knowledge, much of the literature has tended to treat belief as obeying very stringent "ideal" conditions such as logical omniscience (for example, obeying Bel(a--~/3)---~(Bel ~--~Bel/3)). It is this approach that I will explore here. (See <ref type="bibr">[6-8, 17, 19, 26, 27]</ref> for exceptions.) We will find that many such approaches lead to inconsistencies, but eventually find others that are more promising.</p><p>The remainder of the paper addresses the following topics: Section 1 presents a sketch of the underlying intuitions motivating my analysis of introspective reasoning, which will crop up at a technical level again toward the end of the paper. Then Section 2 briefly reviews the importance of selfreference in eommonsense reasoning, in particular with regard to formal substitution. In Section 3 general troubles with paradoxes of substitutive self-reference are reviewed, and modified consistent substitution-assertion rules are given based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Then Section 4 reviews modal logics and problematic aspects of first-order analogues of modal logics for knowledge and belief in the presence of substitution /~ la Montague and Thomason, and in Section 5 we see that modal logics in the presence of substitution are problematic as well. 3 In Section 6 these problems are studied in terms of formal provability, providing a consistent static theory STAT of belief and knowledge; and in Section 7 a result of L6b as well as an example of Moore lead us to the aforementioned distinction between dynamic and static notions of provability and belief and suggest a dynamic theory DYNA. Then in Section 8, I summarize and suggest where more attention may be needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Flattened Layers of Introspection</head><p>Smith <ref type="bibr">[34, p. 40]</ref> tells us "Perfect self-knowledge is obviously impossible... The self can never be viewed in its entirely, because there is no place to stand--no vantage point from which to look." In terms of our earlier remarks, the "obviously" here may mean that at best one can look back at ones "entirety" of a time prior to the present. There are layers of time to the phenomena of deduction and introspection. Flattening the layers into one is an enticing formal device, but a problematic one, whose only apparent usefulness is greater ease of study. But certain features of reasoning may persist invariant over layers and these may then be "flattenable," without the problems ~ that can beset this formal simplification. This is the issue addressed in this paper, and motivated in the rest of Section 1.</p><p>Example 1.1. If g's beliefs do satisfy some condition C, is it not reasonable for 3 I caution the reader that this paper focuses principally on first-order modal logics rather than propositional ones, since we are interested in studying how self-reference is handled, and for this, quantification is needed, although the form that quantification takes is not necessarily that of first-order logic; see Theorem 5.3 and associated discussion.</p><p>Compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for a related use of problematic self-knowledge.</p><p>g to (come to) believe C itself? Yes and no. It may be that in coming to believe C, g's beliefs change in ways that may invalidate certain conditions, even C! As a simple example, if g has (initially) only two beliefs, A and B, then it is a fact, C, that g has only two beliefs. But if g then comes to believe this fact C about itself, it thereby ceases to have only two for it has now come by a third, C, which is therefore no longer true. On the other hand, if C were instead the fact of having at least two beliefs (rather than only two), then g's coming to believe C would not render C false.</p><p>Moreover, it seems clear that not all beliefs of an agent g should remain believed as new statements become believed. An obvious example is that the belief ~Bel/3 ("/3 is not one of my beliefs") should not remain if/3 comes to be believed. This is an example of what we can loosely regard as a local perturbation on g's belief set S. That is, many beliefs are contingent on small details, and can easily change.</p><p>Certain other beliefs, however, seem to be of more permanent character, such as Bel(c~ ~/3)---&gt; (Bel c~ ~ Bel/3), which asserts a global feature of g's reasoning processes. Of course, such a belief need not be true, or remain true over time. But it is perhaps plausible that some such general beliefs might remain true (for g) over a long period, and that g might come to believe those.</p><p>Herein lies the risk: will g's coming to believe a general belief y about its very set of beliefs, alter that set in such a way that y no longer holds, or so that it contradicts other beliefs of g? As with Example 1.1, it depends on y. We will be concerned here to outline some broad categories of y. But one thing we do want, is to be able to make local perturbations without thereby being forced to alter whatever global beliefs are held. Coming to believe /3 should not force giving up, say, Bel(~--&gt;/3)---~ (Bel c~---~ Bel/3). Theories that tend to respect this requirement we call dynamic; ones that do not leave such global wffs inv~riant under local perturbations we call static. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Another approach would be to openly embrace a hierarchy of theories, each looking back into the previous one. This latter suggestion we will not explore further here, although it is one that deserves attention (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>). In this paper we will confine attention to single (flattened, ideal) theories of knowledge and belief, to see whether any can be made to avoid the kinds of difficulties mentioned.</p><p>We will not be able to give necessary and sufficient conditions defining these terms. Nevertheless, they will serve our needs in directing our analysis and reformulation of various theories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Self-Reference as a Principal of Language and Thought</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> the term syntaxal was used to describe languages having terms representing the syntactic features of that same language, the idea being that such self-descriptive power is essential for many purposes within natural language and commonsense reasoning. Rieger <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> uses the term referenceability for a similar notion, namely, that it is often important to reason (and communicate) about a particular feature of an utterance, viz., "That you said howdy struck me as unusual." Here elements of speech themselves are being referenced; for this some device is needed in a formalization. The quotation mechanisms presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> are a possibility. An alternative device is found in modal logic, in which formulas (if not arbitrary expressions) are allowed to be operands to other expressions. One of our concerns here will be to contrast these approaches. ~ We will use the expression "self-referential" as a gloss for either of these concepts (referenceability and syntaxality), noting that this leaves open whether all syntax is to be available for reference, as opposed, say, to whole formulas alone, or other aspects of language. This ambiguity will serve our needs, however, when we consider the alternatives of modal and first-order languages.</p><p>A further feature of natural language, and one that effective self-reference appears to hinge upon, is that of substitutivity. By this I mean the ability to refer to the result of making alterations in a statement, such as "If you had said John is here instead of Mr. Smith is here, I would have understood who you meant." The ability to form and compare such variations on our utterances is so elementary and fundamental to our use of language, that it is hard to imagine taking seriously any proposed formal language for a mechanical version of natural language processing that does not have a corresponding facility. Indeed, it seems tantamount to the ability to represent the very fact that language involves using symbols (e.g. John) to stand for other entities (e.g., John himself), as in "You used Mr. Smith to refer to John." Modal logic (as well as first-order logic) is in general broad enough to allow expression of such notions (if desired).</p><p>However, individual substitutions are not enough, as already suggested above in contrasting John and John. The very concept of substitution should be expressible, as in "If the subject is made plural, the verb should be also, so that if people is substituted for person as subject of a sentence or, then the verb Boolos <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Smorynski <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> deal with another point of contact between self-reference and modal logic, namely, the use of a modal operator for the provability relation, and the corresponding treatment of self-reference as it derives from G6del's Incompleteness Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This has connections with the present work, in that provability is one plausible model for a belief predicate as treated here; however, our focus is on surmounting certain paradoxes related to belief and knowledge rather than studying provability per se. See Section 6 below. should be changed to its plural form." That is, the expression o-that is undergoing internal changes is not specified in detail, for a general rule is being given. This means that variables are needed to refer to expressions in the language. This amounts to little more than the ability to recognize symbolic strings, and so is not a computationally unreasonable condition to place on a language. Now here a modal logic in its usual form may need to be extended to allow variables for this purpose, whereas first-order logic does not require such modification.</p><p>Our starting point then is the contention that giving up such substitutions would be an unrealistic simplification of any formal language for commonsense reasoning. This would be analogous to a reasoning system g that behaves as follows: First, g makes assertion A and then is asked why it chose to make that particular assertion, instead, say, of a similar one with "John" used instead of "Mr. Smith." But g, having no concept of making a particular assertion made up of elements of some language, let alone of altering those elements, simply fails to comprehend what is asked of it. Of course, the design of full-fledged reasoning techniques to deal with such cases may involve many things; I contend however that an adequate treatment of self-referential substitution is one of them. Thus before turning to specific aspects of belief and knowledge, I explore some aspects of substitutive self-reference in first-order and modal logics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Preliminary Results</head><p>We shall call a theory (over a language L) with mechanisms for expressing and asserting substitutions unqualifiedly substitutive. The hallmark of an unqualifiedly substitutive language is that it possseses an operator or predicate Sub(P, Q, a, n) directly</p><p>• 7 asserting the result of substituting in an expression P the expression Q for the nth occurrence of the subexpression a. I.e., if P[Q/a, n] is the expression that results from the indicated substitution, then we are requiring Sub(P, Q, a, n) to be provably equivalent to P[Q/a, n]. Note that Sub here is to be an actual symbol (predicate or otherwise) of L, while P[Q/a, n] is a meta-notation denoting some actual expression of L, namely the one resulting from the actual performance of the substitution. Of course, for the above-mentioned equivalence to be meaningful, the substitution must result in a well-formed formula of L.</p><p>It turns out that for the applications to be pursued here, a rather special variation on the Sub operator is required, namely one in which the substitution of Q for a in P be performed for precisely all occurrences of a in P except the 7 That is, Sub(.) is to behave intuitively as if it were True(sub(-)) where sub is a function symbol. This will appear in more detail below. The reason I do not simply import True and sub wholesale here is that 1 have in mind various applications not all of which fit the mold of predicates and arguments (i.e., modal theories will have operators instead of predicates). last. Therefore I will write simply Sub(P, Q, a). Contexts will vary slightly in that sometimes certain occurrences of terms will be quoted, s</p><p>• 9</p><p>As will be seen, the asserting of the results of substitutions, i.e., relating the referenced syntactic elements to their intended meanings, runs into paradoxes of self-reference. Firstly, a means of unquoting quoted elements is needed, i.e., of saying formally that "c~" carries the meaning a. l~ That is, Sub(P, Q, a) can be thought of as consisting of two conceptually distinct aspects: forming the new expression, and asserting it. These we can conveniently distinguish by writing the formula True(sub(P, Q, a)) where sub is a function producing (a name for) the expression that the indicated substitution leads to, and True asserts this expression. Again of course this can be meaningful only if the substitution leads to a wff of L. However, this apparently cannot be done in such a direct way, for as Tarski <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> showed, the schema True('a') ~ c~ leads, in any reasonably expressive language, to inconsistency.</p><p>The Sub concept described above is the key ingredient here. Unless care is taken, it will be possible to use the variables that range over expressions in such a way that they refer to that very symbol, Sub, and then it is often only a short step to paradox. I formulate this as a theorem in the first-order case; later 1 will present it as well for modal theories. In the present form it can be considered a variation on Russell's paradox as well as on Tarski's result above. Since Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 below amount to variants on ideas already present in the literature (in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>), their presentation here will be abbreviated, especially regarding quotation conventions. The reader can skim quickly through these preliminary results without loss.</p><p>For precision's sake I offer the following definition: Definition 3.1. Let S be a first-order theory over a language L containing a three-place predicate symbol Sub together with the axiom schema Sub('P', 'Q', a),~-,P['Q'/a] where P['Q'/a] is as previously described, for all wffs P and Q and terms a of the language L (which is assumed to contain a constant 'a' for each wff a of L). Then S is said to be unqualifiedly substitutive, s This is, again, since both modal and nonmodal contexts will arise. I have blurred details of quotes so as not to constantly write two forms for every predicate expression. The intention is always to have substitutions result in wffs of the appropriate sort for the context. 1 also have written P[Q/a] for the result of substitution in either case.</p><p>Here again I mean simply that we are using a formula with either an operator or predicate whose intuitive interpretation is to be that of the truth of its operand or argument.</p><p>~0 This is often represented as defining a truth predicate: True('a') is to tell us that the sentence "'a" is true, so that True('a') and a should hold in the same models of a suitable theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 3.2. Let S be an unqualifiedly substitutive first-order theory. Then S &amp; incons&amp;tent.</head><p>Proof. We use R(x) to abbreviate -TSub(x, x, y) and then R('R(y)') abbreviates -TSub('TSub(y, y, y)', '-TSub(y, y, y)', y), which by the schema is equivalent to -77Sub('-TSub(y, y, y)', '-TSub(y, y, y)', y).</p><p>Here we are using the special substitution feature mentioned earlier, so that all except the last occurrence of y in -TSub(y, y, y) is replaced by '-TSub(y, y, y)'. Thus we have R('R(y)') is equivalent to TR('R(y)'), a contradiction.</p><p>An alternative (although less precise) argument is as follows: Define True(x) to be Sub(x, a, a) and apply the schema for Sub. This yields True('a') ~ a for each a, which as mentioned above was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> to be inconsistent under fairly general conditions.</p><p>Part of what is required for the above kind of arguments is the mechanical ability to find and erase a symbol and put another in its place. As we saw above, this is fundamental to the expression of everyday (and significant) features of natural language and reasoning. Of course, all this depends on Sub having axioms that give it the intended meaning of actual symbolic substitution and assertion of the result, and so we can conclude that this is not possible without qualification, in a consistent first-order system.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> the difficulty of formalizing a truth predicate in first-order languages was circumvented, based on ideas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Specifically, it was found that the above problematic schema can be replaced by True('a') ~ a* for all sentences a, where a* is essentially ~ the result of replacing in a all subformulas of the form 7True('. ') by True('7 • '). I will refer to this as GK 1 (the Gilmore-Kripke schema). ~ GK is consistent in a broad setting. I am using the notation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> here. ~3 It turns out that this approach can be applied fairly directly as well to the Sub predicate, and leads us to the following result: ~t There are some qualifications regarding the form of a; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> for details. ~2 This schema is adapted from Gilmore's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> on formalizing set theory, to capture ideas of Kripke <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> regarding truth predicates.</p><p>t3 However, I frequently abuse notation in that quotes and even parentheses may be left off. Thus Bel0-1 .--,0 = 1 abbreviates Bel('0 = 1')---~0 = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 3.3. A ("qualifiedly substitutive") first-order theory S formed from extending a consistent u theory S' not involving the symbol Sub, by the addition of the (qualified) schema</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">Sub('P', 'Q', 'a') ~-&gt; (PI'Q'/al)*,</formula><p>where now we define a* to be the result of replacing ~Sub('P',.) by Sub('~P',. ) in c~, is consistent.</p><p>Proof.

First I turn to a question addressed by Montague <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> concerning first-order analogues of certain modal theories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Modal Theories and First-Order Analogues</head><p>The advantages of first-order logic over modal logic were pointed out by Montague <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> (I will review these later). However, Montague found that the "obvious" approach to using first-order logic instead of modal logic can lead to inconsistencies. Here I look again at Montague's results, to see whether the simplicity of his original suggestion for using first-order logic can be preserved somehow, and just why a modal syntax seems to manage what first-order syntax does not.</p><p>It will turn out that both answers are forthcoming, namely, we will see why modal syntax (sometimes) avoids contradiction, and we will be led to a better understanding of how to represent propositional attitudes in self-referential contexts (whether modal or first-order).</p><p>A modal language is characterized by modalities, i.e., operators that can be applied to formulas to produce new formulas, which however are not definable in terms of the standard propositional connectives. The most familiar examples are the necessity and possibility operators, sometimes written Nec and Poss, where usually one is defined in terms of the other, e.g., Poss a iff ~Nec ~c~. Thus Nec a and Poss a are (modal) formulas, where c~ is any formula in the ~4 Actually we need a consistent theory with at least one infinite model, but this is a very minor restriction, for any consistent theory can be relatively interpreted in a consistent theory with infinite models. language in question. Indeed, a may itself contain one or more instances of Nec or Poss or both. Thus a modal logic has an extended notion of formula, in which for any formula a and any modal operator M, Ma is also a formula. In particular one can adjoin new operators (and axioms and rules) to a first-order language, creating thereby first-order modal logics. This is the case of primary interest for us.</p><p>It is a well-known result that the standard connectives (e.g., &amp; and -7) are sufficient to define all truth-functional operators in a propositional language, so operators that are not truth-functional are called modal to distinguish them from those already definable. Note that indeed the intuitive sense of Nec and Poss depends on more than the mere truth or falsity of their applicands. For instance, unless we are fatalists, a fire may have truly occurred in the house across the street yesterday, without it thereby being necessary that such a fire occurred there yesterday. On the other hand, we may feel inclined to say it was necessarily true that when the temperature of the house reached 451 degrees Fahrenheit, the books began to burn. In both cases, we may suppose the statement which is claimed to be necessary or not, is a true one. But in one case it merely happens to be true, and in the other it apparently follows from a general law about the ignition point of paper. This is not to say that this is a perfectly unambiguous distinction; nonetheless it serves to illustrate operators that cannot be treated as mere shorthands for expressions built of the propositional symbols. This has been taken as evidence that classical propositional logic therefore is inadequate to the task of representing non-truthfunctional operators, and that modal logic should be introduced when such operators are needed.</p><p>In the hands of Hintikka <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and Montague (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>), modal logics for representing concepts such as knowledge and belief have become powerful tools, and consequently a modal extension of first-order logic is regarded as a standard and natural representational medium for dealing with such matters. Thus once again the suggestion appears that extensions to standard logics are needed to represent appropriately the concepts of natural language, especially of belief and knowledge. This unfortunately is not without its disadvantages. For one thing, first-order logic is much better understood than any modal logic formalisms, and consequently easier to apply coherently. Secondly, if some reins are not placed on the proliferation of new logics except when the latter are shown to be genuinely different (if not also useful!) from first-order logic, then we will end up with a tower of Babel, and research will probably suffer.</p><p>However, other avenues are open within first-order logic. One that appears promising is to use, instead of a formula as such, rather a quoted formula or term, so that the intended operator applies to such terms instead of formulas. That is, the operator becomes a predicate symbol: Nec('a') or Poss('a'). Then, so the hope goes, the corresponding axioms can be formulated satisfactorily without going beyond first-order logic. This allows us to state a third technical benefit that would accrue from a first-order approach to propositional attitudes; in particular, in the words of Montague <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, "if modal terms [i.e., modal operators] become predicates, they will no longer give rise to non-extensional contexts, and the customary laws of predicate calculus may be employed." For instance, if in fact Bill and Kathy have the same phone number, a modal wff such as Bel(John, phone(Bill) = 277-1265) when coupled with Leibniz' Rule of Substitutivity (that equal terms may be substituted for one another without disturbing logical equivalence), yields Bel(John, phone(Bill) --phone(Kathy)) even though John may not know this. Thus modal treatments combined with normal substitution practice is problematic, and special conventions are required to keep the unwanted consequences at bay. This suggests the attractiveness of remaining within a first-order language. This is not to say that no problems remain in a first-order setting, of course. However, a first-order approach would instead involve the wff Bel(John,"phone(Bill) = 277-1265") which no longer has phone(Bill) as a term; rather the entire second argument to Bel is one constant term. Other similar difficulties that arise in substitution in modal contexts (sometimes referred to as opacity versus transparency of the modal operator in question), when treated instead via arguments that are quoted formulas, do not occur in first-order logic. The abandonment of first-order logic then is not to be taken lightly.</p><p>Motivated by these concerns, Montague <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> applied this approach to a modality for necessity. That is, writing Nec('c~') instead of Nec c~ he obtained a quotational first-order construction. Montague proposed axioms for such a formulation, in analogy with standard axioms in the corresponding modal treatments. Unfortunately he found these versions to be inconsistent, whereas each corresponding modal operator version M is consistent. This seemed to be strong evidence in favor of the modal treatment. However, it appears that the inconsistency Montague uncovered hinges on certain fundamental expressive strengths of quotational first-order languages which are lacking in usual propositional modal languages. This is, first-order logics have richer sets of formulas than have traditional modal logics. Variables allow the formation of (self-referential) wffs that otherwise would not appear in the language, and thus more is being asserted in first-order logic than in the corresponding modal logic. The question then arises: if a modal theory M is made self-referential (i.e., endowed with expression and assertion of substitutions), is it still consistent? 15 One particular modal theory of interest is $5. Its language is that of propositional logic together with a modal operator. It was first studied as a formalization of the intuitive notion of necessity, with modal operator Neck% but also serves as a (tentative) formalization of the notion of knowledge. When I have knowledge in mind, I use Know instead of Nec, and when I have belief in mind I use Bel. In the immediate sequel I will employ Know. Note that a is a formula in a language containing Know, so that arbitrary nestings of Know are permitted.</p><p>$5 has the following axiom schemata:IT K: Know(a ~/3) ~ (Know a ~ Know/3), T: Knowa.~a, I : ~Know a ~ Know-nKnow a, as well as all (substitution instances of) tautologies, and the following rules of inference:</p><p>MP : from a and a --~/3 infer/3 , N : from a infer Know a.</p><p>$5 as presented above is a propositional theory, although it also has been ~5 It is of separate interest whether a first-order version of a modal logic can be kept suitably "weak" so as not to intrude, via its variables, new kinds of wffs that destroy a faithful match with the modal logic. This has been explored by des Rivieres and Levesque <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Our purposes here are somewhat different, namely, how to represent propositional attitudes in an explicitly selfreferential context. Our contention is that apart from a desire to avoid inconsistency, there should be an underlying intuitive model justifying ones axioms. Then presumably whatever underlying intuitive model justifies the use of any particular modal formulation should apply as well to the full first-order formulation, unless that model itself indicates a principled argument to the contrary.</p><p>'~ Often written as L or a box D. ~7 In the literature, schemata K, T, and 1 are sometimes called Distribution, Knowledge, and Negative Introspection, respectively, and rule N is called Necessitation and sometimes written as RN. I is also sometimes called schema 5, since it is the distinguishing schema of $5. If 1 is dropped, the resulting system is called T (not to be confused with schema T, although schema T is the characteristic schema of the system or theory T). If schema T is dropped as well, the resulting theory is called K (with then characteristic schema K). Theory $4 has schemata K and T and the "Positive Introspection" or "'Poslnt" schema Know a ~ KnowKnow a as well as rule N; so $4 is stronger than T; it turns out that Poslnt is provable in $5 so that $5 is stronger than $4. Thus K, T, $4, and $5 are in increasing order of strength, and all have rule N and schema K; any such system (at least as strong as system K) is called (essentially) a normal system of modal logic. Another system, G, is studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; note that there "normal" is used as here except that rule N is not required. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for more information on the (enormous) variety of modal systems studied. For a recent modal logic specifically designed for AI, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. studied in a predicate context, with an underlying first-order language supplemented with the operator Know, and with the usual logical axioms and rules of inference as well as the axiom schemata K, T, and I, and rule N. It is in the first-order context that we are interested, so that in the remainder of this paper $5 will be taken to mean first-order $5. TM Note that not only is the language extended beyond classical propositional or first-order languages, but also there is a nonclassical rule of inference. This requires comment. Rule N is to be applied strictly to actual theorems of $5, not to any hypothesis a we may wish to employ in proving, say, a--~/3. That is, although if a were a theorem of $5 then so would be Know a, this does not entail that the wff a--~ Know a is a theorem of $5. In particular, extensions to $5 formed by adjoining new axioms are not assumed to obey rule N for any wffs other than the original ones provable in $5 itself, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>As a theory of knowledge, $5 has the following intuitive interpretation: Know a means a is known (by some thinking agent). Then K, T, and I may be plausible for an "ideal thinker" g. Schema K says that g's knowledge is closed under modus ponens; schema T that whatever g knows is true; and schema I that g knows whenever it doesn't know something (i.e., it can introspect negatively). Also, rule N is plausible if the agent is smart enough to know everything that can be established in $5, which may seem easy to grant for an ideal thinker. This presupposes that we are viewing $5 as our "external" theory about g's "internal" knowledge. However, rule N then has the further consequence that g will end up taking as its own knowledge all the axioms and theorems of $5 so that $5 ends up also being g's own theory after all. In this light, rule N serves as a kind of positive introspection mechanism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Montague studied several systems related to $5, with the particular aim of changing Know into a predicate symbol applied to names of formulas. I need not present details of these modal variants in order to state the following result of his: Theorem (Montague <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 3]</ref>). Any first-order "arithmetical" theory having the schema T', namely, Know('a')--~ a for each closed wff a, and also satisfying condition N', that ~-Know('a') whenever ~ a, is inconsistent.</p><p>~ See <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> for more detail on $5 and its uses. '~ The arguments to Know in $5 are interpreted as propositions rather than (quoted) sentences as in a syntactic first-order approach. This has some benefits, such as corresponding to Pierre's and Peter's knowing the "'same" proposition that Londres est jolie and London is pretty, respectively. Also there are technically elegant semantics (due to Kripke; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) that can be provided for $5 and other modal systems. However, this does not alter the fact that Pierre and Peter express their propositions sententially, nor that actual sentences are very important features of language. Thus our comments about the central role of self-referentiality and syntax seem to hold up. There are other qualifications regarding propositions as objects of knowledge or belief as well; for an overview of much of the philosophic literature, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Note that schemata I and K have been left out. I will henceforth however drop the prime on T and N, letting context determine whether a modal or first-order schema is meant. Also, I will retain the names T and N even when the predicate symbol is other than Know, e.g., Bel or the usual provability predicate Thm described later. The term "arithmetical" need not concern us; it is a gloss for a technical requirement that has the effect of allowing asserted substitutions into wffs. 2° We can establish an alternative theorem with a quick proof, if we stipulate a sub function directly, to get a variation on Montague's result that is more tailored to our needs. I begin with a definition. Definition 4.1. If S is a first-order theory with function symbol sub of three arguments, and supplied with a distinct function term 'a' for each expression a (such that the free variables of 'a' are those of a) as well as axioms sub('P', 'Q', 'a') = 'P['Q'/'a']', i.e., the name of the result of the indicated substitution, then S is first-order self-referential. So R('R('y')') is equivalent to TKnow('R('R('y')')'. We further abbreviate R('R('y')') as RR, so that we have RR iff 7Know('RR'). If we then use the 20 Moreover, the use of substitution is virtually tantamount to the introduction of a certain amount of arithmetic in any case (see Quine <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>), and I have argued that substitution is an essential feature of commonsense reasoning. D. PERLIS axiom Know('RR')--&gt; RR, we get Know('RR') ~ -TKnow('RR'), so that Know('RR') is impossible and therefore ~Know('RR') is proved. But this is (equivalent to) RR, so RR is proved. But then by the postulated inference condition, we deduce Know('RR') after all, a contradiction.</p><p>What does this result tell us? It appears that even a very weak subtheory of $5, 2~ when "translated" into a first-order context, goes awry, at least in the presence of substitutivity. But is this reason to think that the modal version is better off? It is true that $5 (and therefore its subtheories) are consistent. But $5 by itself is not in a substitutive context. So the question arises as to whether modal theories such as $5 remain consistent when augmented with substitution capabilities.</p><p>In a similar vein, Thomason <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> has provided another apparent failure of our intuition, as follows: If an agent g believes (a suitable theory of) arithmetic and also g's beliefs (given as arguments to the predicate Bel) satisfy the following conditions: Bel('c~ ') --~ Bel('Bel('a')'), Bel('Bel('a')--~ c~'), Bel('c~') for all valid c~ , Bel('a ---&gt;/3')---&gt; (Bel('c~')---~ Bel('/3')), then g is inconsistent in the sense that g will believe all wffs.</p><p>To relate this to the intuitions of Section 1, I offer the following critique for Thomason's and Montague's theories as theories of omniscient ideal reasoning: In each case, an axiom schema (either T or the second schema above) attributes to g a global belief about g's own beliefs. This self-viewing is best taken as layered or steplike, and when instead it is flattened in one fell swoop then internal contradictions can arise. In effect, when g takes a position regarding the contours of its set S of beliefs, it may be embracing a "new" belief/3 which, if we force/3 E S, can run into a self-referential dilemma. If g is aware of this, it might prudently choose to be more circumspect about its use of self-reference and in the process better merit our designation of it as "omniscient" or "ideal."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Substitutive Modal Logic</head><p>If we endow a modal logic M with the property of substitutivity in the form of an operator Sub(P, Q, a), with the intention that this thereby create suitable 2~ In fact all we need arc schema T and rule N along with first-order logic and self-reference, so that not even the full system T is essential here, since schema K is not used. conditions for referenceability within such an extended version of M, we have at least two available approaches. We can let P and Q be quoted expressions and Sub a predicate symbol, or we can let P and Q be formulas and Sub another modality.</p><p>Let us begin by exploring the first alternative. Since we already know that a first-order unqualifiedly substitutive theory is inconsistent (Theorem 3.2), so will be any modal theory M that extends such a first-order theory. Therefore, if we endow $5 with a predicate symbol Sub, we cannot allow it the unqualified substitution axioms as well. What then if we use only qualified substitution axioms of the sort known to be consistent in the first-order case? That is, can we extend $5 to include Sub(x, y, z)~ True(sub(x, y, z)) together with the consistent treatment of True and sub mentioned earlier, and thereby retain consistency in the modal theory that results? Unfortunately, the following result shows that we cannot. and associated qualified axioms for True and sub, then M is inconsistent.</p><p>Proof. We proceed by defining R(x) to be the formula ~Know Sub(x, x, 'y') .</p><p>Then R('R(y)'), which we will abbreviate as RR is ~Know Sub('R(y)', 'R( y)', 'y'), i.e., ~ Know True(sub('R(Y)', 'R( y)', 'y')) . Now sub('R(y)', R('y'), 'y')) = 'RR' and so True(sub('R( y)', 'R(y)', 'y')) o True('RR') , <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> An anonymous referee has pointed out that the proof does not use schema 1, hence the theorem actually holds if $5 is replaced by any modal system with schemata T and K and rule N, i.e., for any logic as strong as modal system T. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>It follows that [-TKnow True(sub('R(y)', 'R( y)', 'y'))] ~ [--nKnow RR].</head><p>But RR is equivalent to ~Know True(sub('R(y)', 'R(y)', 'y')) , and so we get that RR ~-, ~Know RR Now, Know RR--&gt;RR by schema T, and so Know RR-~-nKnowRR, which means that -1Know RR is a theorem of M. But we have just seen that RR is equivalent to --nKnow RR, so then RR also is a theorem of M, and by rule N so is Know RR, a contradiction.</p><p>We then consider the second alternative mentioned above, namely, that Sub(P, Q, a) be a modality in which P and Q are formulas. Here we are faced with a difficulty of syntax, if we wish to keep to our underlying premise in this paper, namely, that not only should language be substitutive and assertional, but that the very feature of substitutions should be expressible, in the form Sub(x, y, z) where x, y, and z are variables. This becomes problematic when x and y are intuitively to range over formulas (rather than names of formulas). What is called for is a quasi-second-order modal logic, in which the arguments to which modalities are applied (namely predicates, or more generally, relations) can be the values of variables. Thus we wish to write Sub(X, Y, z) where X and Y are predicate variables, and z is an individual variable that ranges over names of expressions. However, it turns out that it is not necessary to adopt such a syntax, for even without variable arguments to modalities, contradiction arises. Definition 5.2. S is an unqualifiedly substitutive modal logic if S has a modality Sub(P, Q, A) and the (by now familiar) substitution axioms using P[Q/A], where P, Q and A are wffs. That is, Sub(P, Q, A) is equivalent to the result of substituting Q for all but the last occurrence of A in P. (We need not even use names at all, for instead of arbitrary expressions, it suffices to refer to whole formulas.) Theorem 5.3. Any unqualifiedly substitutive modal theory is inconsistent.</p><p>Proof. We simply pick an arbitrary wff, say P, and consider the formula (1) below:</p><p>Sub(TSub(P, P, P), ~Sub(P, P, P), P).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">)<label>1</label></formula><p>The indicated substitution will then replace the first two occurrences of P in the first argument -TSub(P, P, P) of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>), with the second argument, which also is 7Sub(P, P, P). This results in 7Sub(-TSub(P, P, P), -TSub(P, P, P), P),</p><p>which is in fact simply 7(1)! That is, (1) is equivalent to 7(1), which is a contradiction .23</p><p>So $5 and even weaker systems such as T are inconsistent with either form of self-reference that naturally arises. Thus any advantage in a modal language seems to be lost, and we might as well remain with a classical first-order language. Still, this does not settle problems of formal representation of belief and knowledge. Whether formulated in terms of classical first-order substitutive or modal substitutive languages, special axioms and rules of inference for propositional attitudes are problematic. We now turn to remedies of this situation, hinging on separating the two mutually troublesome features, namely the schema T, Know('a')--~ a, and the rule N for inferring Know('a') from a.</p><p>23 It is of some interest that the requirement for "variable substitution" has been obviated by the very means of substitution. That is, in some sense the significance of variables is precisely that they allow for the possibility of substitution. This is not so apparent in first-order logic, where variables are central to the entire structure; but in modal logic where seeming arguments (to modalities) are not usually treated in argument fashion, the presence of substitutions is evidently just what brings things back to the first-order fold (at least in regard to self-referential paradox).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Belief as Provability</head><p>Our results indicate that modal logics, when endowed with sufficient power to represent substitutions, face the same inconsistencies found in first-order treatments. Much of the appeal of these logics is then lost, since one might as well then simply stay within first-order logic and employ a stratagem there for retaining consistency, instead of hunting for an analogous stratagem in modal logic. Indeed, we saw from Montague's and Thomason's theorems and from our Theorems 5.1 and 5.3, that there are severe difficulties whether the formal syntax is dressed in first-order or modal clothing. In effect, if we are going to have substitutivity of even a very mild sort we have to choose something less than full use of both the notion Know a.--~ a (schema T) on the one hand, and on the other hand ~-Know a whenever ~-a (the familiar rule N). 24 What principled justification can be given for this, and what principled decision can be made toward a resolution? 25 One point of view emerges from the idea of provability.</p><p>Consider an agent g, whose conclusions are to be represented. Here I use the term "conclusions" as a deliberately neutral ground between knowledge and belief: whatever is in the agent's reasoning is to be used as if trustworthy. While this is still rather vague, it is sufficient for our purposes. 26 What we can say is that an agent's conclusions would seem to be tightly related to what the agent can prove (establish, decide, conclude), so that a natural idea is to explore ideas of provability in an effort to characterize possibilities and limitations on formal treatments of belief and knowledge. This idea was the basis for much of Konolige's efforts in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, in which however provability was represented as a concept external to a given reasoner, i.e., one agent might reason about the provability relation of another agent but not about its own provability relation. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> Konolige comes closer to self-provabitity, but retains a kind of hierarchical approach in which what is provable at one level is then recorded as provable in the next. Here I am more concerned with a "flattened" theory that involves a predicate for its very own provability notion, yet in equal standing with the other predicates in the language; that predicate itself then forms part of the grist for those very proofs to which it is intended to refer. Boolos <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Smorynski <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> examine formal notions of provability, but in relation to arithmetic rather than epistemic concerns. In this and the next section, I study the extent to which various notions of provability are applic-~4 I henceforth routinely drop quotes. All theories will be first-order (nonmodal). 2, Asher and Kamp <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> pursue much the same question, and with a similar course by applying methods for truth predicates to a knowledge predicate. Their work involves a hierarchy of decisions about knowledge, and remains fairly close to Kripke's original idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in that it is model-theoretically oriented. However, the needs of artificial intelligence (and possibly even of logic) seem better served by a more syntactic and proof-theoretic (i.e., computational) approach, as argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. I will comment again on their approach below.</p><p>26 1 refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for discussion of the issue of what constitutes a belief.</p><p>able to belief and knowledge. Initially I focus on the classical static theories; in Section 7, I turn to commonsense constraints. Let us pursue the idea that an agent g's beliefs 27 are its theorems. But then if g is to have a Bel predicate of its own, it may be a kind of provability predicate. What do we mean, formally, that Bel be a provability predicate? Several things may suggest themselves. One, given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, follows. Definition 6.1. A provability predicate for a theory S is a wff P(x) that satisfies rule N--if a is a theorem of S, then so is P('o~')--and also schemata K and S4's Poslnt:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">K: P( a --&gt; fl ) --&gt; ( Pa --) Pfl ) , PosInt : Pa --) PPa.</formula><p>So, what is available for a provability predicate? There are many possibilities, most of which have little to do with provability. However, one provability predicate has played a special role in logic; it is due to G6del, and we write it as Thm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> In this section I will focus on Thm. In the next section we will find that, for certain kinds of commonsense beliefs, this will not do, and we must examine alternative "introspection" predicates that are not provability predicates at all (as we have defined them).</p><p>Thm stands for the usual G6del predicate symbol for provability in a "suitable" theory of arithmetic S, i.e., Thm is defined as Thm('a') ~ (3x)(Proof(x, 'a'), where Proof(x, a) in turn formalizes in terms of arithmetic the proof-theory of S: it says x is (the G6del number of) a proof of (the wff with G6del number) 'a'. Thm then pins down the mechanical details of what goes into a proof. This makes it static, for no new beliefs (axioms) can be adjoined now, without undoing the intended meaning of Thm. Thm lays out explicitly all the steps allowed in a proof, and even says that these are the only ones allowed. This explicit sense of Thm roughly corresponds to the specification of a mechanical listing of all and only the wffs that can be established by g (a recursively enumerable, but not recursive, set of wffs).</p><p>But how much of Thm is needed, anyway, in actual use of a belief predicate? A reasoner need not (and cannot) know all about itself, but might well benefit from knowing certain things about itself. z7 We start here with belief, letting knowledge come in later. It turns out that knowledge is quite a tricky notion; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>z8 Also often written as Prov or Bew (for Beweis).</p><p>In fact, Thin gives so much detail about proofs within a theory S that it inflexibly binds S away from any new knowledge. Thus if S is extended to S', the syntactic definition of Thm, if it is to now express proofs in S', must change. Moreover, certain facts will be new simply because they are not provable within S, and thus Thin cannot ever express them with reference to the theory for which it is formulated. In fact, the same happens with any provability predicate, as we shall see, regarding auto-epistemic knowledge of certain sorts. Now, Montague's result shows that we must give up schema T, if we are to retain rule N and substitutivity (and consistency). That is, not all wffs of the form Bel ~ . ~ a will be theorems of our agent g's theory S. What does this mean in terms of Thm? Intuitively, Thin c~---, a means that each theorem a of S is true (in a fixed standard model). Now, if S really has such a model, then each of these statements Thm o~ .---~ a is correct; that these cannot all be provable in S is an interesting limitation of a computational mechanism to fully express its own computational behaviour. This is closely allied with G6del's Second Incompleteness Theorem and also L6b's Theorem, discussed later. However, the underlying idea of the limitation has an intuitive sense to it, and will be the basis for the general picture that will emerge. The idea is that of Section 1, that the actual processes of a reasoner g can never be known in full detail by g itself, except by g's gaining this as new information which in turn changes g's structure so that what g has gained is a faithful picture of what it was, not what it is.</p><p>As I have stated, Know ~ is often taken to mean ~ is among those beliefs of g that are true. Then Know ~ means to g that ~ is one of its true beliefs, even though in general g cannot identify which these are! Indeed, each of g's beliefs is individually believed (by definition) by g; as soon as any one is seen to be false, it is no longer believed. 2~ So g cannot isolate its true beliefs from the rest; it simply can refer to them in the abstract, just as it can refer to its entire belief set. In effect, g may believe that (the extension of) Know is a proper subset of (the extension of) Bel, but can give no examples of the relative complement (i.e., a false belief)! Nevertheless, using Know as true belief, we can now employ schema T so that it applies to Know rather than to Bel. This manages to get around some of the difficulties we have seen. Specifically, the following result provides one way to endow g with its own knowledge and belief predicates and yet avoid inconsistency. This is a static approach, so that g will not be able to accommodate new beliefs and yet retain the intended meanings of Bel and Know. Theorem 6.2. Let S be any consbtent qualifiedly substitutive first-order theory, 2. Try to imagine a reasoner g having simultaneous beliefs Bel a and ~True a, as in "I believe 1337 is prime, but it is not!" not containing the symbol Bel. Then there is a consistent first-order theory STAT(S), which is an extension of S having predicate symbols True, Bel, and Know, and obeying rule N for Bel, with axiom</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Knowa ~ Bela &amp;Truea,</formula><p>where True satisfies schema GK. 3°</p><p>Proof. Let True be as in GK, and then let Bel be Thm and let Know be as stated, both as extensions by definitions. Rule N is automatic for Bel (inherited from Thin).</p><p>How much of $5 does this result give us? We get rule N for Bel; schema T for True and Know; schema K for Bel, True, and Know. Theorem 6.2 does not give schema I for any of True, Know, or Bel. However, we do get S4's positive introspection schema Poslnt for Bel, since Thm happens to obey Thm a ~ ThmThm a.3 Example 6.3. (Belief biconditionals and cats). A key technique implicit in Montague's and Thomason's results, as well as in Tarski's and G6del's, is the Fixed Point or Diagonalization Lemma (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). This allows us to find, given a predicate P(x), a wff a such that a ~-~-TP('a') is provable in a suitable theory S. Substitutivity (qualified or not) is one criterion that makes S suitable (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>). The principal application for us is the following: Let Bel be a monadic predicate symbol of a theory S. We may then let BB be such that S has the theorem BB ~-~-~Bel BB (which I refer to as the belief biconditional).</p><p>Let C be (a formalization of) the sentence "The cat is on the mat," e.g., On(cat,mat). That is, C is a plain ordinary wff without self-reference, and without use of the predicate symbols Bel or Know or True or Thm. Its truth then should be determinate, even if unknown. Thus g should be safe in concluding not only C v-~C and Know C v-1Know C, but also Know(C v -7C) and Know(Know C v ~Know C). This follows from Theorem 6.2, and 3o In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> a GK version of rule N was used for Know: a**lKnow a, where ** is the Gilmore operator applied to Know rather than to True. This has the unfortunate consequence that straightforward (nonparadoxical) instances of theorems of g were not provably Known by g. For instance, even many harmless theorems such as /3 v /-7/3 did not have corresponding theorems Know[/3 v 7/3]. Thus we have dropped this approach and retained the Gilmore technique for the predicate True alone. Similarly, GK is not very satisfactory as a rule for Bel, for it severely undermines the introspection properties. For instance, if 7Bel/3 is a theorem, so should be Bel-TBel/3; but GK will not provide this. Also, as for Know, theorems of the form/3 v 7/3 should have counterpart theorems Bel[/3 v 7/3], but again GK will not provide this in general.</p><p>3~ It is of interest that Asher and Kamp <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> similarly arrive at a (semantical) framework for Bel, in which schema K and Poslnt are preserved but schemata 1 and T are not. However, as mentioned earlier, their treatment has no corresponding proof theory for direct comparison to our work. forms an interesting contrast with the wff BB. Let S satisfy Theorem 6. Thus tautologies seem to behave well with respect to Bel, and ordinary wffs such as C also do so with respect to Know. But some explicitly self-referential wffs like BB fail to do so. In short, STAT(S) seems to represent a somewhat reasonable static theory of belief and knowledge. But it does not satisfactorily answer our doubts about schema T for Bel. For this, we need to look more closely at what use beliefs are put to, in order to assess what role schema T might or might not be reasonably expected to play.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Belief as Introspection</head><p>Theorem 6.2 above provides a version of Bel (and Know, etc.) that will suffice for certain purposes, such as nesting of belief sentences. As such it may be fine. But more might be desired. Let us see what this might be, by returning to the issue of schema T. Now, we know we may not have the full schema T (for Bel) in g's theory S, if S is to obey rule N (for Bel). And perhaps not all instances of schema T (for Bel) are even plausible for g to conclude. But perhaps certain instances are both plausible and possible. So first we should ask whether commonsense reasoning has need for these.</p><p>Another desideratum arises from rule N itself, for this rule does not necessary apply to new axioms that may be adjoined to S, even though the idea of rule N as an introspection facility should require this. We would like to have a formulation of Bel that is dynamic, in that as g gains new beliefs, the broad characteristics of Bel do not change, and thus that the rules for Bel should also not change simply because g has some additional beliefs. That is, there should be a core theory of belief that is invariant under mere accretion of (at least some 32) information. If rule N is to be in this core, then it must be applicable to new (local) beliefs that arise.</p><p>We lead into this by observing that a different approach to introspection than the "static" one of Thm can be conceived. In particular, as L6b's Theorem will show, certain wffs when adjoined to a theory S result in the meaning of Thm becoming out of date, in the sense that Thm will express provability in the original but not the extended theory. This is because Thm is so pinned down by its arithmetical definition to exact procedures of proof, that it cannot refer abstractly or generically to the general concept of proof. It is statically tied to one and only one set of conclusions. On the other hand, a reasoner g may not even be aware of its precise algorithm for reasoning, and yet refer to it generically in ways that do not depend on details (and therefore may remain consistent with a greater variety of extensions). 33 That is, perhaps a kind of referring to one's theorems or beliefs can be made, without explicitly stating in detail just how they arise. Possibly then Thm is then too fine-grained and unrealistic for commonsense reasoning, both conceptually (who could ever know all their mental processes?) and formally (L6b's Theorem below).</p><p>Where does introspection arise in commonsense reasoning'? One prominent place is in nonmonotonic reasoning, in which account is taken of not having (believing, proving) a certain wff. For instance, one can believe ~ la Moore <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> that one always knows (or believes) that one has an elder brother if this is in fact the case, without necessarily knowing a way in which that conclusion or belief (that one had an elder brother) would be arrived at. 34 This is then generic or abstract information about ones set of conclusions. Just how such a notion might be approached and how it should differ from G6del's explicit Thm will be taken up below. The point however is that an intelligent agent g may not need to know in any great detail just how its mental feats are accomplished; certainly human beings are in this situation. In fact, we will see formal requirements virtually forcing us into this position when we try to give auto-epistemic weight to Bel. Now, can we think of a situation in which g ought to believe an instance of schema T, i.e., of Bel a .--~ a? Well, there are trivial cases, the ones in which is already a theorem. These of course are instances which STAT(S) will also produce. So how about nontrivial ones? Yes, following (or rather reversing) the example of Moore. We can suppose g to believe "if I believe I have an elder brother, then I have an elder brother" even if g does not believe "I have an elder brother." This would be a kind of infallibility belief for g, but a special one regarding brothers, and it seems perfectly plausible that an agent might have good grounds for such a belief as this.</p><p>Moore's (unreversed) example itself is also of interest; it has the form: ~ Bel a. Although this is not an instance of schema T, it is also not obvious that it is consistent with STAT(S) as long as Bel remains a provability 33 This raises a number of issues, only some of which will be dealt with in the remainder of this paper. One I will not touch is that of hierarchical "cycles" of reasoning over time, as the agent realizes more and more about its (changing) inference algorithm(s). However, this would appear to be a key one for future work. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for very interesting results on hierarchies of theories of arithmetic, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for an approach to commonsense reasoning viewed as a steplike process. 3~ Hence, from the not knowing (of an elder brother), one concludes the not having.</p><p>predicate. Of course, here too there are trivial (or vacuous) cases, when -la is a theorem of S. Definition 7.1. A wff a is simple auto-epistemic over theory S if a is of the form Bel/3 --&gt;/3, or/3 --~ Bel/3, or 7Bel/3, where 13 is in the language of S. (S may or may not contain the symbol Bel.) I name the three types: MAE is the set of wffs of the Moorean form/3 --~ Bel/3, RAE of the reverse form Bel/3 ~/3, and NAE of the negative form 7Bel/3. Note that MAE wffs include instances of Poslnt, and all RAE wffs are instances of schema T. I will sometimes abbreviate "simple auto-epistemic" as "simple AE." This is not to say that all wffs of interest in auto-epistemic reasoning must be of one of the three given forms. Far from it. However, these three types seem to be the simplest ones and arguably the commonest, and also plenty of questions arise even for them.</p><p>Note that Thm does not satisfy schema T--this is essentially G6del's Theorem on consistency proofs, and also can be seen in Montague's <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 3]</ref>. That is, not all wffs Thm a .--&gt; a will be theorems of g. However, a theorem of L6b carries this much further, so that not a single instance of T will be provable except trivial ones for which a itself is provable. Call a wff Thm a .--&gt; a trivial if a is a theorem of S. We suppose here (as throughout the paper) that S has sufficient substitution properties, in this case the Fixed Point Lemma referred to earlier. Thus if Bel is formalized (defined) as Thm, then no nontrivial RAE wff is a theorem of S. This is stronger than Montague's result that some RAE wff will fail to be provable (i.e., schema T in its full form clashes with rule N). Now we are faced with the fact that each instance of schema T (except trivial ones) clashes with the Thm interpretation of Bel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L6b's</head><p>What is going on here? After all, if a system (or reasoner) g does happen to have beliefs or theorems that are true (in some standard interpretation for ~' This is a very striking result that seems counterintuitive at first. One consequence is that no wff of the form ~Pa can be a theorem of S if S is consistent. This also arises out of G6del's Theorem on consistency proofs, which is easily proved from Lob's theorem and conversely. G6del's result--his Second Incompleteness Theorem--is that 7(3x)[Thm x &amp; Thin 7x] is not a theorem of S.</p><p>which Thm has the standard meaning), then all wffs Thm a .--~ a will also be true in that interpretation. But why then cannot g be made to prove this, since it is true? Well, on our suggested intuitions from Section 1, g can come to do so (by being given this extra information), but in the process g will change (as a formal system) and Thm will then characterize what g was, not what g is. Put differently, the result of L6b tells us g cannot know Thm to capture precisely its means of drawing conclusions; in fact it will not as soon as g thinks that it does! Or in AI terms, an ideal 36 g can never fully catch up declaratively with its <ref type="bibr">• 37</ref> own procedures for drawing conclusions. For instance, the wff Bel0 = 1 .--~ 0 = 1 will not, by L6b, be provable in S, even though it will be consistent with any reasonable such S. Now if we extend S to S' = S + Bel0 = 1.---~0 = 1, S' will be consistent but then Bel cannot be a provability predicate for S' (unless S' is inconsistent)• Thus provability predicates are static: their properties do not remain invariant over additions of even very modest new introspective information.</p><p>Note that -7 Pa v -7 P-7 a is a kind of consistency statement for a provability predicate P. So -7Bel a v -TBel 7a can also be regarded as a kind of selfconsistency belief. Now, while this may in general be too strong for a realistic agent g, still certain cases of it seem unassailable. For instance, -7Bel 0 = 1 should be concludable by g, on the basis that -70 = 1 and that Be1-70 = 1. Yet L6b precludes this for provability predicates. Thus we separate two studies: static provability systems, and dynamic introspection systems that allow for the incorporation of new beliefs while retaining invariant general or generic information about beliefs as a whole. The latter requires giving up provability predicates as models for Bel; in their place we substitute what we shall call "introspection predicates."</p><p>It is true that L6b's Theorem applies to more than simply Thm; any provability predicate P(x) gives us ~--7Pa for any a. However, the two postulates for a provability predicate in addition to rule N, namely Poslnt and schema K, are not ones we should necessarily assume for Bel. That is, even though they may be true about g's reasoning, they are not facts g will necessarily know about itself. We then have the following result, toward a dynamic theory of belief. Theorem 7.2. Let S be any consistent qualifiedly substitutive first-order theory not including the predicate letter Bel in its language, and let AE be any set of 36 I.e., consistent, logically omniscient, and knowing sufficient arithmetic. 37 m similar notion is exploited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to characterize certain forms of default reasoning. Also Konolige <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> treats a similar theme from a different formal perspective.</p><p>Moorean or reverse auto-epistemic wffs over S. Then there is a consistent extension DYNA(S) in which all AE wffs are provable.</p><p>Proof. Let M be a model for S, and then form a model M' of S + AE by interpreting Bel as truth in M; this will satisfy all auto-epistemic wffs of AE. For given a wff Bel a .---* a, if a is true in M, then a (and hence Bel a .---* a) already holds in M'; and if a is not true in M, then Bel cr is false in M' and so again Bel a .---~ a holds. For a wff a ---* Bel a, if a holds in M' then it also holds in M and so Bel a is true in M', making a ~ Bel a true in M'; and if a does not hold in M' then a ~ Bel a holds trivially. Then the theory of M' extends S and has all wffs in AE as theorems.</p><p>Corollary 7.3. DYNA(S) above can be taken to obey DYNA(S)}-Bel a whenever S ~ a.</p><p>Proof. The same model M' in the proof of Theorem 7.2 is a model of Bel c~ for all theorems u of S, and so again the theory of M' serves.</p><p>It is necessary to restrict S and AE as above, namely S must not contain the symbol Bel, so that AE will not contain wffs in the language of S. 3~ If a were allowed to be any wff in the extended language including Bel, then we could easily create Liar-type wffs and run into Tarski's theorem. 39 But we have already done what Thm (or any provability predicate) cannot do, in having even one nontrivial auto-epistemic belief present. Note that in modelling Bel as provability for S, we have not made Bel the same as Thin, for Bel is in the language of the extension S+ AE, not of S. That is, Bel is not Thm for S + AE, and so L6b does not apply to the extension. But by the same token, Bel then is not an introspection predicate in the extension either.</p><p>Do we get similar results to STAT(S) for cats and BB here? Yes, from Corollary 7.3, letting S have the GK schema for True, and defining Know a be Bel a &amp; True a as before, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">DYNA(S) ~-Know(C v ~ C), DYNA(S) ~ Know(BB v --qBB) ,</formula><p>DYNA(S) ~-Bel(c~ v -7 c 0 for all wffs c~ in the language of S. Some natural cases have been missed, since we are working with a restricted 3s And thus Corollary 7.3 does not provide the full rule N for Bel. 39 Or Montague's theorem; e.g., from MAE wffs we would get rule N, and from RAE wffs we would get schema T, making the by now familiar deadly mix. language in which there is no nesting of belief or knowledge. Thus we still have not achieved our goal of making g highly introspective as to its own beliefs. In particular, rule N is present only in very restricted form, applied to theorems of S but not to the extension in which the predicate Bel enters the language. Is anything else lacking? What might we want, for Bel to be an introspection predicate? Several things may suggest themselves. However, among the simplest is what I shall call the double-N rule, NN, which amounts to our familiar rule N from $5 and its converse N 1, that is, a is a theorem of g iff Bel a is a theorem of g. Thus g can recognize (prove) it has a as a theorem (i.e., g can prove Bel a), precisely when it really does have a as theorem. This makes Bel in some sense "correct." Whether such a g is still realizable as a purely first-order theory is another matter. We are using rules of inference (N and its converse) outside of standard first-order logics, unless the logic in question obeys NN as a consequence of its axioms (note, for instance, that schema T in a theory makes N-' is redundant). Thm does happen to obey NN, although due to L6b this will not help us here. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S ~-P(t) iff S ~-Q(t).</head><p>Proof. Trivial.</p><p>It might appear from Lemma 7.5 that at most one predicate (up to equivalence) could satisfy NN, thus forcing it to coincide with Thm. For NN seems to characterize fully just what atoms of its associated predicate (e.g., Bel) can hold. After all, Bel a will be forced on g as a conclusion whenever (and only when) a itself is a conclusion. This might then seem to limit our formal choices for Bel very severely, indeed perhaps force us back to Thm and the loss of simple AE wffs. However, this is not necessarily the case, and leads to an open problem below. Roughly, L6b might not ruin our chances at an auto-epistemic formalization for Bel, because there might co-exist more than one introspection predicate for the same theory. 4° Now we might ask whether introspection should go even further than than our new definition. In particular, the following may seem reasonable to consider: Definition 7.6. A theory S with introspection predicate Bel is fully introspective if whenever a wff a in the language of S is not a theorem of S, then -7Bel a is a theorem of S.</p><p>A fully introspective reasoner then would always be able to tell correctly for every wff whether it believed it or not: S ~-Bel a or S ~--TBel a for each c~. Now, such a reasoner, if consistent and knowing sufficient arithmetic, would have a non-recursively-enumerable set of theorems. Still, it may be of epistemological interest to know that in principle such reasoning could be envisioned. However, it is not to be. Theorem 7.7. 41 Every fully introspective qualifiedly substitutive first-order theory S is inconsistent.</p><p>Proof. We form BB as usual, so that BB ~ 7Bel BB is a theorem of S. Now either BB is a theorem of S or it is not. If BB is provable, then (rule N, from Bel's being an introspection predicate) so is Bel BB. But also from the biconditional we get ~BB, a contradiction. Suppose then that BB is not provable in S. Then by negative introspection we get -TBel BB, hence (from the biconditional again) BB, and finally (rule N) Bel BB, contradiction. (Note that we used only rule N, not full NN, so actually we have a stronger result than the stated one.)</p><p>We seem to be stuck then with (at best) the more modest introspection notion of rule NN for Bel. To recapitulate: static notions of introspection as in Thm are subject to L6b's Theorem while auto-epistemic versions of Bel ought not to be. We can do pretty well in a static (Thin-and NN-based) theory of belief, if we avoid consideration of AE wffs (Theorem 6.2). And conversely we can do pretty well in an AE theory of belief if we avoid NN (Theorem 7.2).</p><p>It is getting both together that remains problematic. We offer as a "Belief Doctrine" that Bel should satisfy both NN and a wide variety of cases of MAE, RAE, and NAE. It is then worth seeing whether some introspection predicate (other than Thm) might achieve this. In short, what kind of theories DYNA(S) obey rule NN? We know that if Bel is such a predicate, and if it obeys (within a theory S) schema K, then by L6b it cannot obey PosInt and so will not coincide with Thm. In our terms Bel would be dynamic and generic, failing to correspond in detail to the actual reasoning mechanisms of g. But we have 4~ This was inspired by a conversation with Richard Weyhrauch, Sardinia, October 1986. This result is not necessarily negative. Commonsense reasoners may well be inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and yet have interesting formal properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Regarding AER in particular, we know of course ~ is fine (take Bel to be Thm), and that using all reverse wffs is never so <ref type="bibr">(Montague)</ref>. In fact, we cannot include Bel BB ~ BB for the same reason. But is there any nonempty subset of RAE that is consistent with NN? If so, then there can be more than one introspection predicate for one and the same theory: a provability predicate will not be the only choice, despite Lemma 7.5.</p><p>In terms of our notion of flattened layers, certain global statements such as Poslnt and K will not allow mundane local statements such as RAE to be present. If we "force" them into an extension, we simply end up changing the theory so that we are, after all, looking back at the earlier "entirety" rather than the present (new) one. The Open Problem then is asking how much local perturbation (individual instances of simple AE wffs) we can get away with and yet preserve a useful amount of globality in the form of rule NN. Note that we did get a weak answer, in the Corollary 7.3, since rule N is obeyed there for wffs a that do not themselves contain the symbol Bel, and this already gives a number of cases useful in commonsense.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>When a formal language is endowed with self-referential capabilities, especially in the presence of unqualifiedly substitutive mechanisms, difficulties of contradiction can easily arise. This holds for modal as well as (pure) first-order logics. However, the features of self-reference and substitutivity appear fundamental to any broad knowledge representation medium. Moreover, when remedies are taken, the modal treatments seems to offer no advantage over the first-order ones, and indeed the latter carry advantages of their own. One can argue that although an agent g cannot know its beliefs to be true, still they might be true by good luck (or by the clever design of the agent's reasoning devices by a godlike artificial intelligencer), and all g's inference rules might be sound as well. But then, if g is an ideal reasoner, wouldn't it be appropriate for g to believe this too? Wouldn't such an ideal g be able to believe Bela.---~a for all a? The odd answer (which we have seen in Montague's <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 3]</ref>) is: not if g's beliefs are to be consistent, which of course they must be if they are to be true. But this can be seen as an overly bold flattening of an essentially layered concept of Know. Of course, Thm is also a kind of flattening, but one in which no new information is to be brought in, by the very concept of Thm which pins down precisely what is allowed.</p><p>In fact, L6b shows us even more: that schema T can be allowed for no c~ except trivial cases, unless we give up provability as the measure of belief; then PosInt and other vestiges of pinned-down provability must be left aside. But since auto-epistemic reasoning depends on (certain instances of) schema T, agents will have to rely on dynamic (perturbation-tolerant) reasoning about their own beliefs. They cannot fully introspect; in particular, they will have to rely on pragmatic means to tell, for instance, that they do not have a certain belief.</p><p>I have been occupied here in showing that, after all, a flattened picture of commonsense may be available, a once-and-for-all set of wffs closed under certain procedures. This is what DYNA(S) really does, and it does so by leaving out wffs that might force the meaning of Bel to no longer be an introspection predicate. That is, the tradition of research that I have been exploring throughout this paper is in the mold of finding a fixed set of conclusions that g can believe, but allowing a reasonable amount of introspective self-reference at the same time.</p><p>Perhaps ironically, the static and flattened provability predicates, such as Thm, which obey PosInt and schema T, and which were found to thwart some attempts at a commonsense view, are the ones that would force a major change in any agent dealing with them, in a cycle of ever-expanding interpretations of its growing mechanisms of proof. Thus our dynamic version of Bel is not really one for a real-time agent at all. The conclusion, then, is that people have sought fixed formulations for belief using what are intrinsically nonfixed notions of self-description. For a single (and hence flattened) theory of belief to be viable, it must deal with predicates that are tolerant of self-description in a context of simple AE wffs; such theories are what I have called dynamic. The real trouble is that if Bel is made to look at itself closely enough, then it ends up describing a theory different from the one being investigated. This is fine if a cycle of ever-stronger theories is the focus of interest. However, single theories are vastly simpler to study, and so it is worth seeing how far this flattened approach can be carried.</p><p>The formalization of (fixed theories of) knowledge and belief still faces conceptual difficulties, especially in the case of agents whose beliefs are closed under logical consequence. In particular, it is unclear whether rule NN can be made consistent with reasonable commonsense instances of schema T. But it also appears that the study of agents with limited reasoning power, as has been initiated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> is in great need of further study. Key to those approaches is the absence of the rule of inference "from c~ infer Know c~" (with respect to a deductive engine which is sound and complete). Although some of these latter efforts utilize modal formulations, our work here strongly suggests that this is more a matter of taste than any real technical distinction, and thus that it may be preferable to stick with a common formal language to facilitate comparison in future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Theorem 4 . 2 .which is equivalent to 7 Know(' 7</head><label>4277</label><figDesc>Let S be a first-order self-referential theory having a monadic predicate symbol Know and axioms Know('a')--~ c~ for each closed wff ~, and satisfying the condition ~-Know('c~') whenever ~ a.
