<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The periodic implementation of control tasks is the most common approach for feedback control systems. However, this might be a conservative choice, since the constant sampling period has to guarantee stability in the worst-case scenario. It is apparent that a reduction on the number of the control updates is desirable because it can lead to the alleviation of the energy consumption, or in the case of networks, it can result to amelioration of the network traffic. In recent years the framework of event-driven feedback and sampling has been developed. This results to a more flexible aperiodic sampling, while preserving necessary properties of the system, such as stability and convergence. Related works can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by the fact that NMPC are widely used control strategies, with conspicuous advantages such as the capability to deal with nonlinearities and constraints, in this paper an event-based framework for this kind of controllers, is investigated. In addition, most NMPC control schemes are computationally demanding, so it would be of great interest if the control law would not be updated at each sampling instant but rather, the already computed control trajectory, would be implemented to the plant until an event occurs. This approach, could be useful in cases, where the computation of the optimal control law is demanding, as in large-scale systems, opposed to the computation of the predicted trajectory. This is for example the case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where an event-based NMPC approach for nonlinear continuous-time systems with nominal dynamics, is presented. The approach is used in order to overcome the bounded delays and information losses Alina Eqtami and Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos are with the Control Systems Lab, Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, 9 Heroon Polytechniou Street, Zografou 15780, Greece {alina,kkyria@mail.ntua.gr}. Dimos V. Dimarogonas is with the KTH ACCESS Linnaeus Center, School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden {dimos@ee.kth.se}. His work is supported by the Swedish Research Council through VR contract 2009-3948. that often appear in networked control systems. Although the formulation is event-driven, a criterion for triggering was not provided.</p><p>The contribution of this paper relies in finding sufficient conditions for triggering, in the case of uncertain nonlinear systems with additive disturbances, under robust NMPC strategies. The main assumption for the general event-triggered policies, is the ISS stability of the plant as it can be seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, for discrete-time systems and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, for continuous. There has been a lot of research on ISS properties of MPC for discrete-time systems. For linear systems the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. More recent results for the ISS properties of nonlinear MPC can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the authors presented a robust NMPC controller for constrained discrete-time systems. They also proved that the closed-loop system was ISS, with respect to the uncertainties.The framework proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, is our starting point here. Although most researchers have focused on the discrete-time frame, the ISS stability of a robust NMPC in continuous-time sampled-data systems was recently presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, the triggering condition of a continuous-time system under a robust NMPC control law is given, while a convergence analysis of an uncertain nonlinear system is also provided. We note that the discrete-counterpart will be presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and is outlined here for the sake of coherence. Although the event-based setup for MPC controllers is quite new, some results have already been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the problem statement for the continuoustime case is presented. Sufficient conditions for triggering of an uncertain continuous-time system under NMPC are provided in Section III. The discrete counterpart of the above framework is reviewed in Section IV, and in Section V some simulation results are presented. Section VI summarizes the results of this paper and indicates further research endeavors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR CONTINUOUS-TIME SYSTEMS</head><p>In the following a triggering condition for continuous-time nonlinear systems under NMPC control laws is going to be presented. following the idea behind the analysis proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for discrete-time systems, appropriately modified in this case, for continuous-time systems.</p><p>Consider a nonlinear continuous time system</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ẋ(t) = f (x(t), u(t)), x(0) = x 0 (1) x(t) ∈ X ⊂ R n , u(t) ∈ U ⊂ R m<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We also assume that f (x, u) is locally Lipschitz in x, with Lipschitz constant L f and that f (0, 0) = 0. The whole state x(t), is assumed to be available. Sets X , U are assumed to be compact and connected, respectively, and (0, 0) ∈ X × U.</p><p>In a realistic formulation though, modeling errors, uncertainties and disturbances may exist. Thus, a perturbed version of (1) is going to be considered as well. The perturbed system can be described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ẋ(t) = f (x(t), u(t)) + w(t), x(0) = x 0<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the additive term w(t) ∈ W ⊂ R n is the disturbance at time t ∈ R ≥0 and W is a compact set containing the origin as an interior point. Furthermore, note that w(t) is bounded because it is defined in a compact set w(t) ∈ W. Thus, there exists γ sup ∈ R ≥0 such that sup t≥0 ||w(t)|| ≤ γ sup .</p><p>Given the system (1), the predicted state is denoted as x(t i +τ, u(•), x(t i )). This notation will be equipped hereafter and it accounts for the predicted state at time t i + τ with τ ≥ 0, based on the measurement of the real state at time t i while using a control trajectory u(•; x(t i )) for time period t i until t i + τ . It holds that x(t i , u(•), x(t i )) ≡ x(t i ), i.e. the measured state at time t i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. NMPC for Continuous-Time Systems</head><p>The main idea behind NMPC is to solve on-line a finitehorizon, open-loop optimal control problem, based on the measurement provided by the plant. At the recalculation time t i , the actual state of the plant x(t i ), is measured and the following Optimal Control Problem (OCP), is solved:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">min ũ(•) J(ũ(•), x(t i )) = min ũ(•) ti+Tp ti F (x(τ ), ũ(τ )) d τ + E(x(t i + T p )), (4a) s.t. ẋ = f (x(t), ũ(t)), x(t i ) = x(t i ),<label>(4b)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">ũ(t) ∈ U,<label>(4c) x</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">(t) ∈ X t-ti t ∈ [t i , t i + T p ],<label>(4d)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">x(t i + T p ) ∈ E f ,<label>(4e)</label></formula><p>where • denotes the controller internal variables, corresponding to the nominal dynamics of the system. F and E are the running and terminal costs functions, respectively, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E ∈ C 1 , E(0) = 0. The terminal constraint set E f ⊂ R n is</formula><p>assumed to be closed and connected. Assume, also, that the cost function F is quadratic of the form F (x, u) = x T Qx + u T Ru, with Q and R being positive definite matrices. Moreover we have F (0, 0) = 0 and F (x, u) ≥ λ min (Q)||x|| 2 , with λ min (Q) being the smallest eigenvalue of Q. Since X and U are bounded, the stage cost is Lipschitz continuous in X × U, with a Lipschitz constant L F .</p><p>The state constraint set X of the standard MPC formulation, is being replaced by a restricted constraint set X t-ti in (4d). This state constraints' tightening for the nominal system with additive disturbance is a key ingredient of the robust NMPC controller and guarantees that the evolution of the real system will be admissible for all time.</p><p>Notice that the difference between the actual measurement at time t i + τ and the predicted state at the same time under some control law u(t i + τ, x(t i )), with 0 ≤ τ ≤ T p , starting at the same initial state x(t i ), can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to be upper bounded by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">||x(t i + τ ) -x(t i + τ, u(•), x(t i ))|| ≤ γ sup L f (e L f •τ -1) (5) Set γ(t) γ sup L f (e L f •t -1) ∀t ∈ R ≥0 . The restricted constrained set is then defined as X t-ti = X ∼ B t-ti where B t-ti = {x ∈ R n : ||x|| ≤ γ(t - t i )}, with t ∈ [t i , t i + T p ]. The set operator "∼" denotes the Pontryagin difference.</formula><p>The solution of the OCP at time t i provides an optimal control trajectory u * (t; x(t i )), for t ∈ [t i , t i + T p ], where T p represents the finite prediction horizon. A portion of the optimal control that corresponds to the time interval [t i , t i + δ i ), is then applied to the plant, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">u(t) = u * (t; x(t i )), t ∈ [t i , t i + δ i )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where δ i represents the recalculation period that may not be equidistant for every t i ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">δ i = δ(t i ) = t i+1 -t i . A time instant t i ∈ R ≥0 must be a proper recalculation time, in the sense defined in [17], i.e. a time instant t i ∈ R ≥0 is a proper recalculation time if there exists β ∈ R ≥0 , such that, 0 &lt; β ≤ t i+1 -t i = δ i &lt; T p , ∀t i , t i+1 ∈ R ≥0 .</formula><p>In order to assert that the NMPC strategy results in a robustly stabilizing controller, some stability conditions are stated for the nominal system. Thus, system (1) is supposed to fulfill the following assumption.</p><p>Assumption 1. i) Let the terminal region E f from (4e) be a subset of an admissible positively invariant set E of the nominal system, where E ⊂ X is closed, connected and containing the origin.</p><p>ii) Assume that there is a local stabilizing controller h(x(t)) for the terminal set E f . The associated Lyapunov function E(•) has the following properties</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∂E ∂x f (x(τ ), h(x(τ ))) + F (x(τ ), h(x(τ ))) ≤ 0 ∀x ∈ E and is Lipschitz in E , with Lipschitz constant L E . iii) The set E is given by E = {x ∈ R n : E(x) ≤ α E } such that E ⊆ X = {x ∈ X Tp : h(x) ∈ U}. The set E f = {x ∈ R n : E(x) ≤ α E f } is such that for all x ∈ E , f (x, h(x)) ∈ E f . Assume also that α E , α E f ∈ R ≥0 and is such that α E ≥ α E f . iv) ∃ T p , such that 0 &lt; β ≤ δ(t) &lt; T p , for some β ∈ R ≥0 .</formula><p>Note that i)-iii) are standard assumptions for a NMPC system, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Assumption iv), can be verified either experimentally or theoretically for specific systems and it states that every recalculation time is a proper recalculation time.</p><p>The event-triggered strategy presented later in this paper, is used in order to enlarge, as much as possible, the inter-calculation period δ i for the actual system (3). The enlargement of the inter-calculation period results in the overall reduction of the control updates which is desirable in numerous occasions, as for example energy consumption reasons. In an event-based framework the inter-calculation period is not equidistant but is "decided" ex tempore, based on the error between the actual state measurement of (3), and the state trajectory of the nominal system, (1). The triggering condition, i.e. how the next calculation time t i+1 , is chosen, is presented next.</p></div>

TRIGGERING CONDITION FOR THE NMPC OF CONTINUOUS-TIME SYSTEMS</head><p>In this section, the feasibility and the convergence of the closed loop system (3), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) are provided first. Then, the eventtriggering rule for sampling is reached.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Feasibility and Convergence</head><p>As usual in model predictive control, the proof of stability consists in two separate parts; the feasibility property is guaranteed first and then, based on the previous result, the convergence property is shown. Due to the fact that the system in consideration is perturbed, we only require "ultimate boundedness" results.</p><p>The first part will establish that initial feasibility implies feasibility afterwards. Consider two successive triggering events t i and t i+1 and a feasible control trajectory ū(•, x(t i+1 )), based on the solution of the OCP in</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">t i , u * (•, x(t i )) ū(τ, x(t i+1 )) = = u * (τ, x(t i )) ∀τ ∈ [t i+1 , t i + T p ] h(x(t i + T p , u * (•), x(t i ))) ∀τ ∈ [t i + T p , t i+1 + T p ]<label>(7)</label></formula><p>From feasibility of u * (•, x(t i )) it follows that there is ū(τ, x(t i+1 )) ∈ U, and similar to the procedure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> x(t i+1 + T p , ū(τ, x(t i+1 )), x(t i+1 )) ∈ E f provided that the uncertainties are bounded by γ sup ≤</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(α E -α E f )•L f LE•(e L f •Tp -1)</formula><p>. Finally, the state constraints must be fulfilled. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and considering that ||x(t) -</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">x(t, u(•), x(t i ))|| ≤ γ(t), for all t ≥ t i , it is verified that since the x(t, u * (•), x(t i )) ∈ X t-ti , then x(t, ū(•), x(t i+1 )) ∈ X t-ti+1 .</formula><p>The second part involves proving convergence of the state and is being introduced now. In order to prove stability of the closed-loop system, it must be shown that a proper value function is decreasing starting from a sampling instant t i . Consider the optimal cost J * (u * (•; x(t i )), x(t i )) J * (t i ) from (4a) as a Lyapunov function candidate. Then, consider the cost of the feasible trajectory, indicated by J(ū(•; x(t i+1 )), x(t i+1 )) J(t i+1 ), where t i , t i+1 are two successive triggering instants. Also, x(τ, ū(τ ; x(t i+1 )), x(t i+1 )) is introduced, and it accounts for the predicted state at time τ , with τ ≥ t i+1 , based on the measurement of the real state at time t i+1 , while using the control trajectory ū(τ ; x(t i+1 )) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>Set</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">x 1 (τ ) = x(τ, ū(τ ; x(t i+1 )), x(t i+1 )), u 1 (τ ) = ū(τ ; x(t i+1 )), x 2 (τ ) = x(τ, u * (τ ; x(t i )), x(t i )) and u 2 (τ ) = u * (τ ; x(t i )).</formula><p>The difference between the optimal cost and the feasible cost is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">J(t i+1 ) -J * (t i ) = ti+1+Tp ti+1 F (x 1 (τ ), u 1 (τ )) d τ + E(x 1 (t i+1 + T p )) - ti+Tp ti F (x 2 (τ ), u 2 (τ )) d τ -E(x 2 (t i + T p )) = ti+Tp ti+1 F (x 1 (τ ), u 1 (τ )) d τ + E(x 1 (t i+1 + T p )) + ti+1+Tp ti+Tp F (x 1 (τ ), u 1 (τ )) d τ - ti+1 ti F (x 2 (τ ), u 2 (τ )) d τ - ti+Tp ti+1 F (x 2 (τ ), u 2 (τ )) d τ -E(x 2 (t i + T p )) (8)</formula><p>From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">7</ref>), we have that u 1 (t) ≡ u 2 (t) ≡ ū(t) for t ∈ [t i+1 , t i + T p ], so imposing this control law to the system (1), it yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">||x 1 (t) -x 2 (t)|| = ||x(t i+1 ) + t ti+1 f (x(τ ), ū(τ )) d τ -x(t i ) - ti+1 ti f (x(τ ), u * (τ )) d τ - t ti+1 f (x(τ ), ū(τ )) d τ ||<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Note that for the nominal system (1), it holds that</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">x(t i+1 , u * (•), x(t i )) = x(t i ) + ti+1 ti f (x(τ ), u * (τ )) d τ Also, we have || t ti+1 f (x(τ ), ū(τ )) d τ - t ti+1 f (x(τ ), ū(τ )) d τ || ≤ γ(t -t i+1 ) ∀t ≥ t i+1<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Define the error e(t, x(t i )) as the difference between the actual state measurement at time t ≥ t i and the predicted state measurement at the same time, i.e.,</p></div>

The nominal model of the system without the additive disturbance is of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">x k+1 = f (x k , u k ).

The norm of the difference between the predicted and the real evolution of the state is the error denoted as e and will be equipped in the following analysis. In order to address for the specific time step the double subscript notation is going to be used here, as well.

Consider the system (21), subject to the constraints, under an NMPC strategy and assume that the previously presented Assumption 2 holds. Then the NMPC control law given by (23a)-(23d) along with the triggering rule (24a)-(24b), drives the closed loop system towards a compact set where it is ultimately bounded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXAMPLE</head><p>In this section, a simulated example of the proposed design on a robotic manipulator is presented. The objective is to provide an efficient NMPC controller, triggered whenever (24a) or (24b) is violated, in order to stabilize the robotic manipulator, in a desired equilibrium configuration. Consider a general manipulator of r degrees of freedom (d.o.f.), which does not interact with the environment. The joint-space dynamic model of these types of manipulators is described as: B(q)q + C(q, q) q + F q + g(q) = τ</p><p>where B is the inertia matrix, C is the Coriolis term, g is the gravity term, F is a positive definite diagonal matrix of viscous friction coefficients at the joints, q = [q 1 , . . . , q r ], q = [ q1 , . . . , qr ] and q = [q 1 , . . . , qr ] are the vectors of the arm joint position, velocity and acceleration, respectively. Finally, τ ∈ R r are the joint torque inputs. We consider a two-link, planar robotic manipulator, r = 2 with no friction effects for simplicity.In the control affine, state-space model of the manipulator, the state accounts for x = [q 1 , q 2 , q1 , q2 ]. The initial state is x initial = [π/2, 0, 0, 0] and the desired state is x desired = [0, 0, 0, 0]. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the norm of the distance between the state of the system and the desired state is depicted. The simulation shows that the system (25), under a NMPC strategy, using the triggering condition (24a)-(24b), converges to the final state in the nominal case. In the perturbed case the system converges to a bounded set around the origin. The next Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, depicts the triggering moments, during the NMPC strategy. It can be witnessed that using the eventtriggered policy, the inter-calculation times are strictly larger than one when the system is far away from the equilibrium, until about the 80th time step. After the 80th time step, the system has practically converged to the desired equilibrium. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, event-triggered strategies for control of both continuous and discrete-time systems under NMPC controllers, were proposed and analyzed. In both cases, uncertain nonlinear systems with additive disturbances, were considered. The main idea behind the event-triggered framework is to trigger the solution of the optimal control problem of the NMPC, only when it is needed. During the interevent period the control law provided from the previous triggering event, is utilized in an open-loop fashion. This event-based approach is favorable in numerous occasions, because it is possible to reduce the number of times the control law should be computed, thus it can result to the alleviation of the energy consumption, or in the case of networks, it can result to amelioration of the network traffic. The results were illustrated through a simulated example. Future work involves finding the triggering condition in a cooperative control problem of a system of distributed agents which operate in a common environment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
