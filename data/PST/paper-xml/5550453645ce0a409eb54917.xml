<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Online social networks o↵ering various services have become ubiquitous in our daily life.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Nowadays, online social networks with specific characteristics have become an essential part in our daily life. Users in online social networks can usually enjoy a wide variety of social services, e.g., establish social connections with friends, write online posts, check in at locations. Meanwhile, social networks which provide these various services can usually contain heterogeneous information, which include multiple kinds of information entities, e.g., users, posts and locations, and complex links among these entities, e.g., social links among users <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> and location checkin links between users and locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Via these diverse links in online social networks, users can be connected with each other closely. Consider, for example, given two users, Alice and Bob, who both have checked in at the "Lincoln Memorial " in Foursquare 1 , the location checkin links "Alice Lincoln Memorial Bob" can form a path from Alice to Bob in the network. Formally, the sequences of links starting and ending with users in online social networks are defined as the social paths. The length of social paths is defined as the number of links that constitute them. For instance, path "Alice Lincoln Memorial Bob" is a social path of length 2 connecting Alice and Bob in Foursquare.</p><p>In all possible connections among users, social links, which are one kind of social paths of length 1 as well, among users have received lots of attention in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>. The problem of predicting social links to be formed in the near future based on a snapshot of online social networks is formally defined as the social link (formation) prediction problem. Many concrete social services in social networks can be cast as social link prediction problems, e.g., friend recommendation. Meanwhile, as pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, users' "loyalty" to a social network is positively correlated to the number of friends they have in the network. As a result, social link formation prediction problem, which can help introduce more social connections for users, can be very important for online social networks.</p><p>Traditional link prediction problems which aim at predicting one single kind of links in one network <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3]</ref> have been studied for many years. Dozens of di↵erent link prediction methods have been proposed so far <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3]</ref>. Conventional link prediction methods usually assume that there exists su cient information within the network to compute features (e.g., common neighborhoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>) for each pair of nodes. However, as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>, such assumption can be violated seriously when dealing with social networks containing little information because of the "new network" problems.</p><p>The new network problem can be encountered when online social networks branch into new geographic areas or social groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and information within the new networks can be too sparse to build e↵ective link prediction models. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> notice that users nowadays can participate in multiple online social networks simultaneously. Users who are involved in a new network can have been using other well-developed networks for a long time, in which they can have plenty of heterogeneous information. To address the new network problem, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> propose to transfer information from the well-developed networks to overcome the shortage of information problem in the new network. Formally, networks that share some common users are defined as the "partially aligned networks" and the common users shared across these "partially aligned networks" are named as the "anchor users" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>. In this paper, we define the unshared users as the "non-anchor users" between the aligned networks.</p><p>Social networks aligned by the "anchor users" can share common information. Meanwhile, as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>, di↵erent online social networks constructed to provide different services usually have distinct characteristics. Moreover, information in various social networks may be of different distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>, which is named as the "network di↵erence problem" in this paper. The "network di↵erence problem" will be a obstacle in link prediction across multiple partially aligned networks, as it is likely that information transferred from other aligned networks could deteriorate the prediction performance in a given network.</p><p>In this paper, we want to predict the formation of social links in multiple partially aligned networks simultaneously, which is formally defined as the multi-network link prediction problem in this paper. As introduced at the beginning of this section, the multi-network link prediction problem can have very extensive applications in real-world social networks. As a result, the multi-network link prediction problem studied in this paper is very important for multiple partially aligned social networks.</p><p>The multi-network link prediction problem studied in this paper is a novel problem and totally di↵erent from other existing link prediction problems. Moreover, link prediction methods proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> cannot be applied to solve the multi-network link prediction problem directly because these existing methods: (1) are proposed to transfer useful information for anchor users only; (2) fail to consider the network di↵erence problem; (3) can only predict links in each network independently. A more detailed comparison of the multi-network link prediction problem with these correlated problems, e.g., social link prediction for new users <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, transfer heterogeneous links across networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, anchor link prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> and multi-transfer with multiple views and sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, is available in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Despite of its importance and novelty, the multi-network link prediction problem studied in this paper is also very challenging to solve due to the following reasons:</p><p>• lack of features: Networks studied in this paper can contain di↵erent kinds of information. Proper defini-tion of heterogeneous features extracted for social links from the networks is a prerequisite for addressing link formation prediction tasks.</p><p>• partial alignment: To overcome the "new network problem", we propose to transfer information from other aligned networks. Existing information transferring methods proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> can only work well for anchor users. Method that can transferring information for both anchor users and non-anchor users is what we desire in this paper.</p><p>• network di↵erence problem: Di↵erent networks usually have di↵erent characteristics and information transferred from other aligned networks can be di↵erent from that of the given network, which could deteriorate the link prediction performance in the given network.</p><p>• simultaneous link prediction in multiple networks: The multi-network link prediction problem covers multiple link prediction tasks in multiple partially aligned networks simultaneously. Analysis and utilization the correlations among these tasks to enhance the prediction performance in each network mutually is very challenging.</p><p>To solve all these above challenges in the multi-network link prediction problem, a novel link prediction framework, Mli, is proposed in this paper. Inspired by Sun's <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> work on meta path as a means to capture similarity of nodes, which are not directly connected in heterogeneous information networks, Mli explores the meta path concept to generate useful features. Mli can generate not only intranetwork features via "intra-network meta paths", but also inter-network features via "inter-network meta paths" through the anchor links. By judiciously selecting the "inter-network meta paths", Mli can take advantage of the commonality among the multiple partially aligned networks, while contain the potential negative transfers from network di↵erences. These derived features can greatly improve the e↵ectiveness of Mli in predicting links for each network. Furthermore, Mli is a general link formation prediction framework that solves the multi-network link prediction problem and the link prediction tasks in di↵erent networks can help each other mutually.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the problem. Detailed description of the methods is available in Section 3. We show the experiment results in Section 4. Related works are given in Section 5. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>In this section, we will give the formal definitions of many important concepts used in this paper and the formulation of the multi-network link prediction problem. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Terminology Definition</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">G = ((G 1 , G 2 , • • • , G n ), (A 1,2 , A 1,3 , • • • , A 1,n , A 2,3 , • • • , A (n 1),n )), where G i , i 2 {1, 2, • • •</formula><p>, n} is a heterogeneous social network and A i,j 6 = ;, i, j 2 {1, 2, • • • , n} is the set of undirected anchor links between G i and G j . Definition 3 (Anchor Links): Let U i and U j be the user sets of G i and G j respectively. Link (u i , v j ) is a undirected anchor link between G i and G j i↵(</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u i 2 U i ) ^(v j 2 U j )</formula><p>(u i and v j are the accounts of the same user in G i and G j respectively). Definition 4 (Anchor Users): User u i 2 U i is an anchor user in G i between G i and G j i↵ 9v j 2 U j , (u i , v j ) 2 A i,j . The set of anchor users in G i between G i and G j can be represented as U i A i,j = {u i |u i 2 U i , 9v j 2 U j , (u i , v j ) 2 A i,j }. Definition 5 (Non-Anchor Users): User u i 2 U i is an nonanchor user between G i and G j i↵ u i / 2 U i A i,j . The set of non-anchor users in G i between G i and G j can be represented as U i A i,j = U i U i A i,j . Definition 6 (Full Alignment): Networks G i and G j are fully aligned if users in both G i and G j are all anchor users. In other words, G i and G j are fully aligned i↵(</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">U i A i,j = U i ) ^(U j</formula><p>A i,j = U j ). Definition 7 (Partial Alignment): Networks G i and G j are partially aligned if there exist users in G i or G j who are non-anchor users. In other words, G i and G j are partially aligned i↵ ((U i A i,j 6 = ;) _ (U j A i,j 6 = ;)) ^(A i,j 6 = ;). Considering that fully aligned networks can hardly exist in the real world, di↵erent from the strict full alignment assumption of networks proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>, networks used in this paper are partially aligned instead. In addition, there exists no restriction about the constraint on anchor links, which means that the anchor links can be either one-to-one <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> or many-to-many. existing social link set of G i can be represented as U i and E i u,u respectively. In network G i , all the existing links are the formed links and, as a result, the formed links of G i can be represented as P i , where P i = E i u,u . Furthermore, a large set of unconnected user pairs are referred to as the unconnected links, U i , and can be extracted from network</p></div>

In this paper, with P i and U i , we formulate the link formation prediction as a PU link prediction problem.</p><p>Similarly, let</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{P 1 , • • • , P n }, {U 1 , • • • , U n } and {L 1 , • • • , L n }</formula><p>be the sets of formed links, unconnected links, and links to be predicted of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">G 1 , G 2 , • • • , G n respectively. With the formed and unconnected links of G 1 , G 2 , • • • , G n ,</formula><p>we can solve the multi-network link prediction problem as a multi-PU link prediction problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PROPOSED METHODS</head><p>In this section, we will introduce Mli to solve the multinetwork link prediction problem. This section includes 3 parts: (1) social meta path based feature extraction and selection; (2) PU link prediction; (3) multi-network link prediction framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Social Meta Path Definition and Selection</head><p>Before talking about the link prediction methods, we will introduce the features extracted from the partially aligned networks in this subsection at first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Intra-Network Social Meta Path</head><p>Users in heterogeneous online social network can be extensively connected to each other via di↵erent paths. In this part, we will categorize the diverse paths connecting users in one single network with the intra-network social meta paths concept.</p><p>For a given heterogeneous online social network, e.g., G, to describe its structure more clearly, we define its schema to be SG = (T, R), where T , R are the sets of node types and link types in G. For example, if G = (V, E), where V = U [P [L contains user, post and location nodes, E = Eu,u[Eu,p[E p,l contains the social links, write links and location links, then SG = (T, R), T = {User, Post, Location} and R = {Social Link, Write Link, Location Link}. A complete schema of networks studied in this paper is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In network G, nodes can be connected with each other via extensive paths consisting of various links. To categorize all possible paths in heterogeneous networks G, we define the concept of intra-network meta path based on schema SG as follows: Definition 8 (Intra-Network Meta Path): Based on the</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">given the network schema, SG = (T, R), = T1 R 1 ! T2 R 2 ! • • • R k 1 ! T k is defined to be a meta path in network G, where Ti 2 T, i 2 {1, 2, • • • , k} and Ri 2 R, i 2 {1, 2, • • • , k 1}.</formula><p>Meanwhile, depending on types of nodes and links that constitute it, can be divided into two di↵erent categories. Definition 9 (Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Intra-Network Meta Path): For a given meta path = T1</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R 1 ! T2 R 2 ! • • • R k 1 ! T k defined based on SG, if (T1, • • • , T k are all the same )^(R1, • • • , R</formula><p>k 1 are all the same), then is a homogeneous meta path; otherwise P is a heterogeneous meta path.</p><p>In this paper, we are mainly concerned about meta paths connecting user nodes, which can be defined as the intranetwork social meta path. Definition 10 (Intra-Network Social Meta Path): For a <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure">T</ref> k are both the "User" node type, then P is defined as a social meta path. Depending on whether T1, • • • , T k and R1, • • • , R k 1 are the same or not, P can be divided into two categories: homogeneous intranetwork social meta path and heterogeneous intra-network social meta path.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">given meta path = T1 R 1 ! T2 R 2 ! • • • R k 1 ! T k de- fined based on SG, if T1</formula><p>Based on the schema of networks studied in this paper, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we can define many di↵erent kinds of homogeneous and heterogeneous intra-network social meta paths for network G, whose physical meanings and notations are listed as follows: Homogeneous Intra-Network Social Meta Path</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">• ID 0. Follow : User follow ! User, whose notation is "U ! U " or 0(U, U ). • ID 1. Follower of Follower : User follow ! User follow ! User, whose notation is "U ! U ! U " or 1(U, U ). • ID 2. Common Out Neighbor : User follow ! User follow 1 ! User, whose notation is "U ! U U " or 2(U, U ).</formula><p>• ID 3. </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">= T1 R 1 ! T2 R 2 ! • • • R k 1</formula><p>! T k from the network is defined to be the expected number of formed path instances between u and v in the network: </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">x(u, v) = I(u, T1)I(v, T k ) X n 1 2{u},n 2 2T 2 ,••• ,n k 2{v} k 1 Y i=1 p(ni,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Anchor Meta Path</head><p>When a network is very new, features extracted based on intra-network social meta paths can be very sparse, as there exist few connections in the network. Consider, for example, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we want to predict whether social link (A 1  , B 1 ) in network G 1 will be formed or not. Merely based on the intra-network social meta paths, the feature vector of extracted for link (A 1 , B 1 ) will be 0. However, we find that A 1 and B 1 can be correlated actually with various internetwork paths, e.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">B 1 ! B 2 ! A 2 ! A 1 , B 1 ! B 2 ! F 2 ! A 2 ! A 1 and B 1 ! B 2 ! E 2 ! A 2 ! A 1 .</formula><p>By following this idea, we propose to transfer useful information from aligned networks with the following anchor meta path and the inter-network social meta paths to be introduced in Subsection 3.1.4. Definition 12 (Anchor Meta Path): Let U i , U j be the user nodes of G i and G j respectively and A i,j be the anchor links between G i and G j . Meta path ⌥= T1 R 1 ! T2 is an anchor meta path between network G i and G j i↵ T1 = U i and T2 = U j and R1 = A i,j . The notation of anchor meta path from G i to G j is ⌥(U i , U j ) and the length of ⌥(U i , U j ) is 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">? Network 1 Network 2 A 1 A 2 B 1 B 2 C 1 D 1 D 2 ? E 1 G 2 F 2</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Inter-Network Social Meta Paths</head><p>Based on the definition of anchor meta path, we can describe the inter-network paths from B 1 to A 1 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> with the following inter-network meta path. Definition 13 (Inter-Network Meta Path):</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Meta path = T1 R 1 ! T2 R 2 ! • • • R k 1 ! T k is an inter-network meta path across G i and G j i↵ 9m 2 {1, 2, • • • , k 1}, Tm Rm ! Tm+1 = ⌥(U i</formula><p>, U j ). In this paper, we are concerned about inter-network meta path starting and ending with users, which are named as the inter-network social meta path. The 4 specific inter-network social meta paths used in this paper include:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Category 1: ⌥ ( U i , U j ) ( (U j , U j )[ 0(U j , U j )) ⌥(U j , U i ), whose notation is 1(U i , U i ); Category 2.: ( ( U i , U i )[ 0(U i , U i )) ⌥(U i , U j ) ( (U j , U j )[ 0(U j , U j )) ⌥(U j , U i ), whose notation is 2(U i , U i ); Category 3.: ⌥ ( U i , U j ) ( (U j , U j )[ 0(U j , U j )) ⌥(U j , U i ) ( (U i , U i ) [ 0(U i , U i )), whose notation is 3(U i , U i ); Category 4.: ( ( U i , U i )[ 0(U i , U i )) ⌥(U i , U j ) ( (U j , U j )[ 0(U j , U j )) ⌥(U j , U i ) ( (U i , U i )[ 0(U i , U i )), whose no- tation is 4(U i , U i ); where (U i , U i )[ 0(U i , U i ) = { 0(U i , U i ), • • • , 6(U i , U i )} denote the 7 intra-network social meta paths of network G i introduced in Subsection 3.1.1. Let = { 1, 2, 3, 4}.</formula><p>is a comprehensive internetwork social meta path set and features extracted based on can transfer information for both anchor users and nonanchor users from other aligned networks. For example, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, by following path "B 1 ! B 2 ! A 2 ! A 1 ", we can go from anchor user B 1 to anchor user A 1 and such path is an instance of 1(U 1 , U 1 ); by following path</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">C 1 ! A 1 ! A 2 ! D 2 ! D 1 , we can go from non-anchor user C 1 to anchor user D 1 , which is an instance of 2(U 1 , U 1 ); in addition, by following path C 1 ! A 1 ! A 2 ! B 2 ! B 1 ! E 1 ,</formula><p>we can go from non-anchor user C 1 to non-anchor user E 1 , which is an instance of 4(U 1 , U 1 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5">Social Meta Path Selection</head><p>As introduced in Section 1, information transferred from aligned networks is helpful for improving link prediction performance in a given network but can be misleading as well, which is called the network di↵erence problem. To solve the network di↵erence problem, we propose to rank and select top K features from the feature vector extracted based , xT ] T be the features of the top K mi score selected from [x T , x T ] T .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">PU Link Prediction</head><p>In this subsection, we will propose a method to solve the PU link prediction problem in one single network.</p><p>As introduced in Section 2, from a given network, e.g., G, we can get two disjoint sets of links: connected (i.e., formed) links P and unconnected links U. To di↵erentiate these links, we define a new concept "connection state", z, in this paper to show whether a link is connected (i.e., formed) or unconnected in network G. For a given link l, if l is connected in the network, then z(l) = +1; otherwise, z(l) = 1. As a result, we can have the "connection states" of links in P and U to be: z(P) = +1 and z(U ) = 1.</p><p>Besides the "connection state", links in the network can also have their own "labels", y, which can represent whether a link is to be formed or will never be formed in the network. For a given link l, if l has been formed or to be formed, then y(l) = +1; otherwise, y(l) = 1. Similarly, we can have the "labels" of links in P and U to be: y(P) = +1 but y(U) can be either +1 or 1, as U can contain both links to be formed and links that will never be formed.</p><p>By using P and U as the positive and negative training sets, we can build a link connection prediction model Mc, which can be applied to predict whether a link exists in the original network, i.e., the connection state of a link. Let l be a link to be predicted, by applying Mc to classify l, we can get the connection probability of l to be: Definition 14: (Connection Probability): The probability that link l's connection states is predicted to be connected (i.e., z(l) = +1) is formally defined as the connection probability of link l: p(z(l) = +1|x(l)), where x(l) = [x (l) T  , x (l) T ] T .</p><p>Meanwhile, if we can obtain a set of links that "will never be formed", i.e., "-1" links, from the network, which together with P ("+1" links) can be used to build a link formation prediction model, M f , which can be used to get the formation probability of l to be: Definition 15: (Formation Probability): The probability that link l's label is predicted to be formed or will be formed (i.e., y(l) = +1) is formally defined as the formation probability of link l: p(y(l) = +1|x(l)).</p><p>However, from the network, we have no information about "links that will never be formed" (i.e., "-1" links). As a result, the formation probabilities of potential links that we aim to obtain as proposed in Section 2 can be very challenging to calculate. Meanwhile, the correlation between link l's connection probability and formation probability has been proved in existing works <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> to be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">p(y(l) = +1|x(l)) / p(z(l) = +1|x(l)).</formula><p>In other words, for links whose connection probabilities are low, their formation probabilities will be relatively low as well. This rule can be utilized to extract links which can be more likely to be the reliable "-1" links from the network. We propose to apply the the link connection prediction model Mc built with P and U to classify links in U to extract the reliable negative link set. Definition 16: (Reliable Negative Link Set): The reliable negative links in the unconnected link set U are those whose connection probabilities predicted by the link connection prediction model, Mc, are lower than threshold ✏ 2 [0, 1]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">RN = {l|l 2 U, p(z(l) = +1|x(l)) &lt; ✏}.</formula><p>Some Heuristic methods have been proposed to set the optimal threshold ✏, e.g., the spy technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we randomly selected a subset of links in P as the spy, SP, whose proportion is controlled by s%. s% = 15% is used as the default sample rate in this paper. Sets (P SP) and (U [SP) are used as positive and negative training sets to the spy prediction model, Ms. By applying Ms to classify links in (U [SP), we can get their connection probabilities to be: p(z(l) = +1|x(l)), l 2 (U [ SP), and parameter ✏ is set as the minimal connection probability of spy links in SP:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">✏ = min l2SP p(z(l) = +1|x(l)).</formula><p>With the extracted reliable negative link set RN , we can solve the PU link prediction problem with classification based link prediction methods, where P and RN are used as the positive and negative training sets respectively. Meanwhile, when applying the built model to predict links in L i , the optimal labels, Ŷi , of L i , should be those which can maximize the following formation probabilities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Ŷi = arg max Y i p(y(L i ) = Y i |G 1 , G 2 , • • • , G k ) = arg max Y i p(y(L i ) = Y i | h x (L i ) T , x (L i ) T i T )</formula><p>where y(L i ) = Y i represents that links in L i have labels Y i . </p><formula xml:id="formula_22">y(L n ) P n , U n L n feature ! extraction feature ! extraction feature ! extraction … … p(L n ) p(L 2 ) p(L 1 )</formula><p>x (P 1 ), x (U 1 )</p><p>x (P 2 ), x (U 2 )</p><p>x (P n ), x (U n )</p><p>x (P n ), x (U n )</p><p>x (P 2 ), x (U 2 )</p><p>x (P 1 ), x (U 1 )</p><p>x (L 1 )</p><p>x (L 2 )</p><p>x (L n )</p><p>x (L n )</p><p>x (L 2 )</p><p>x (L 1 ) </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">y(P n ), y(U n ) M 1 , MS 1 M 2 , MS 2 M n , MS n</formula></div>

The formation probabilities of links in L i predicted by model M i will be used to update the network by replace the weights of L i with the newly predicted formation probabilities. The initial weights of these potential links in L i are set as 0 (i.e., the formation probability of links mentioned in <ref type="bibr">Definition 11)</ref>. After finishing these steps on G i , we will move to conduct similar operations on G i+1 . We iteratively predict links in G 1 to G n alternatively in a sequence until the results in all of these networks converge.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Datasets</head><p>The datasets used in this paper are Foursquare and Twitter, both of which are famous heterogeneous online social networks. These two networks were crawled during November of 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>. The structures of both Foursquare and Twitter have been introduced in Section 2. Statistical information about these two datasets is available in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2:</ref> • Foursquare: 5, 392 users, 48, 756 tips and 38, 921 locations are crawled from Foursquare.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Comparison Methods</head><p>To show the advantages of Mli, we compare Mli with many other baseline methods, which include:</p><p>• Mli: Method Mli is the multi-network link prediction framework proposed in this paper, which can predict social links in multiple online social networks simultaneously. The features used by Mli are extracted based on the meta paths selected from and across aligned networks.</p><p>• LI: Method LI (Link Identifier) is identical to Mli except that LI predict the formation of social links in each network independently.</p><p>• SCAN: Method SCAN (Cross Aligned Network link prediction) proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> is similar to Mli except that (1) SCAN predicts social links in each network independently;</p><p>(2) features used by SCAN are those extracted based on meta paths and 1 without meta path selection.</p><p>• SCAN-s: Method SCAN-s (SCAN with Source Network) proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> is identical to SCAN except that the features used by SCAN-s are those extracted based on 1 without meta path selection.</p><p>• SCAN-t: Method SCAN-t (SCAN with Target Network) proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>) is identical to SCAN except that the features used by SCAN-s are those extracted based on without meta path selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>The social links in both Foursquare and Twitter are used as the ground truth to evaluate the prediction results. SVM  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> with linear kernel and optimal parameters is used as the base classifier of all comparison methods. Accuracy, AUC and F1 score are used as the evaluation metrics in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Experiment Setups</head><p>All the existing links in Foursquare are used as the positive link set and a proportion of unconnected links among users except the positive links are sampled as the negative link set, which is of the same size as the positive link set. Both the positive and negative link sets are divided into 5 folds: 4 folds as the training set and 1 fold as the test set. To represent di↵erent degrees of newness (available information users have in the networks), a fraction of information, which include posts, location checkins, temporal records, is randomly sampled from Foursquare as the available information under the control of parameter ⇢ F 2 [0, 1] and the remaining information are deleted. Meanwhile, ⇢ F proportion of the positive links are randomly sampled as the final positive link set and the remaining (1 ⇢ F ) proportion of positive links are mixed with the negative links to form the final unlabeled link set: U F . A subset of links in U F are extracted as the reliable negative link set, RN F , with the spy technique. In a similar way, we can obtain the positive and reliable negative links in Twitter to be P T and RN T , controlled by the sampling parameter ⇢ T 2 [0, 1].</p><p>Supervised models, M F , built with P F and RN F , are applied to classify links in the test set, L F . Depending on the specific methods, features used to build the models can be di↵erent and social meta path selection model MS F is applied to select the most useful social meta path based features (K is set as 7 in the experiment) to build model M F . The predicted formation probabilities of links in L F will be used to update their link weights in Foursquare. Based on the updated aligned networks, supervised models, M T , built with P T and RN T , will be applied to classify links in the test set, L T , in which social meta path selection model MS T is applied as well. And the predicted formation probabilities of links in L T will also used to update their weights in Twitter. Only the weights of potential social links in L F and L T will be updated in each iteration and this process continues until the predicted formation probabilities of links in L T and L F converge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Experiment Results</head><p>To denote di↵erent degrees of network newness, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>, we fix ⇢ T as 0.8 but changes ⇢ F within {0.1, 0.2, • • • , 0.8}. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> has two parts: the upper part is the link prediction results in Foursquare and the lower part is that in Twitter, as Mli is an integrated PU link prediction framework. The link prediction results in each part are evaluated by di↵erent metrics: AUC, Accuracy and F1. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>, Mli can outperform all other comparison methods consistently for ⇢ F 2 {0.1, 0.2, • • • , 0.8} in both Foursquare network and Twitter network. For example, in Foursquare when ⇢ F = 0.5, the AUC achieved by Mli is about 5% better than LI, 15% better than SCAN, 19% better than SCAN-t and 73% better than SCAN-s; the Accuracy achieved by Mli is about 2.3% better than LI, 8% better than SCAN, 9.1% higher than SCAN-t and over 40% higher than SCAN-s; the F1 of Mli is 6.4% higher than LI, 18% higher than SCAN and SCAN-t and 36% higher than SCAN-s. When ⇢ F = 0.5, the link prediction results of Mli in Twitter are also much better than all other baseline methods. For instances, in Twitter the AUC of Mli is 0.923 ± 0.002, which is about 6% better than LI, over 13% better than SCAN, SCAN-t and over 40% better than SCAN-s. Similar results can be obtained when evaluated by Accuracy and F1.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>, we fix ⇢ F = 0.8 but change ⇢ T with values in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> where ⇢F varies, Mli can beat all other methods in both Twitter and Foursquare when the degree of newness of the Twitter network changes.</p><p>Mli can perform better than LI in both Foursquare and Twitter, which shows that predicting social links in multiple networks simultaneously in Mli framework can do enhance the results in both networks; the fact that LI can beat SCAN shows that features extracted based on cross network meta paths can do transfer useful information for both anchor and non-anchor users; SCAN works better than both SCAN-t and SCAN-s denotes that link prediction with information in two networks simultaneously is better than that with information in one single network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Parameter Analysis</head><p>An important parameter that can a↵ect the performance of all these methods is the rate of anchor links existing across networks. In this part, we will analyze the e↵ects of the anchor link rate, ⇢A 2 [0, 1.0]. To exclude other parameters' interference, we fix ⇢ F and ⇢ T as 0.8 but change ⇢ A with values in {0.1, 0.2, • • • , 1.0} and study the link prediction results in both Foursquare and Twitter under the evaluation of AUC, Accuracy and F1. The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, where Figures 5(a)-5(c) are the link prediction results in Foursquare and the Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(d</ref>)-5(f) are those in Twitter, almost all the methods can perform better as ⇢ A increases, except SCAN-t as it only utilizes information in the target network only. It shows that with more anchor links, Mli, LI, SCAN and SCAN-s can transfer much more information from other aligned source networks to the target network to enhance the results. In addition, Mli can work better than LI consistently as ⇢ A varies, which can show the e↵ectiveness of Mli in dealing with networks with di↵erent ratios of anchor links</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Convergence Analysis</head><p>Mli need to predict the links in all the aligned networks alternatively and iteratively until convergence. In this part, we will analyze whether Mli can converge as this process continues. We show the link prediction results achieved by Mli in both Foursquare and Twitter under the evaluation of AUC, Accuracy and F1 when ⇢ F , ⇢ T and ⇢ A are all set as 0.8 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6(a</ref>)-6(c) are the results in Foursquare network from iteration 1 to iteration 30 and Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6(d</ref>)-6(f) are those in Twitter network. As shown in these figures, results achieved by Mli can converge in less than 10 iterations in both Foursquare and Twitter evaluated by all these three metrics.</p></div>
