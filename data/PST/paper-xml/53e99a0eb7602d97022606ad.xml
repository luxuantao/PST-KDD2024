<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Traffic engineering (TE) has become an indispensable tool used by many autonomous systems (ASes) to select routes which effectively utilize their network resources. This is particularly important given the high cost of network assets and the highly competitive nature of the Internet ISP market <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref>. The importance of traffic engineering has motivated many studies in the last few years, and quite a few traffic engineering algorithms were recently proposed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>).</p><p>Traffic characteristics are a major factor affecting the design of traffic engineering algorithms. Unfortunately, for many ASes, although their traffic demand can be relatively stable most of the time, there exist time periods during which traffic can be highly dynamic, containing unpredictable traffic spikes that ramp up extremely quickly, leaving no time for a traffic engineering algorithm to re-compute or adjust. We recently examined the traffic traces of several backbone networks and found that there exist short time periods during which traffic demand can increase by at least one order of magnitude. Highly unpredictable traffic variations have ity during traffic spikes, and some reaches 2.44 times link capacity, while for an optimal algorithm, no link receives traffic above 50% of its capacity. Such large performance penalties arise when actual traffic demands deviate significantly from prediction. Therefore, it is important that a traffic engineering algorithm is robust when such deviations occur.</p><p>One way to deal with unpredictable traffic spikes is oblivious routing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>). In oblivious routing, a routing that is independent of the traffic matrix is computed, and thus has the potential to handle traffic spikes well. A potential drawback of oblivious routing, however, is its sub-optimal performance for normal traffic, which may account for the vast majority of time periods. For example, the optimal oblivious ratio of arbitrary symmetric networks can grow logarithmically as they scale up <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. Recently, Applegate and Cohen <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> computed the oblivious ratio of several real network topologies. Although they discovered that the ratio is typically only around 2, they also commented that overhead at this level "is far from being negligible to working ISPs."</p><p>Besides rapid traffic fluctuations, interdomain routing poses another set of challenges to traffic engineering. First, interdomain routing introduces point-to-multipoint demand; that is, there can be multiple equally-good egress points for some external destinations in the BGP decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Thus, it is up to the intradomain routing determined by traffic engineering to break the tie. Since egress links may become the bottlenecks of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, this tie-breaking can affect the congestion of the network. Second, although interdomain routes for most traffic volumes can be stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref>, there are BGP routing changes that can cause significant shifts of traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. In particular, with the dynamic nature of the global Internet, the available interdomain routes of an AS can fluctuate as its peers announce and withdraw interdomain routes, or even reset their eBGP sessions. Thus, the intradomain routing determined by traffic engineering should be robust against such interdomain route changes.</p><p>In this paper, we propose novel traffic engineering algorithms to handle both dynamic traffic and interdomain routing. Our key insight is that we can use an efficient and easily implementable technique to guarantee worst-case performance under all traffic demands. By choosing a worst-case guarantee that is just a small percentage above lowest possible, we can optimize routing for predicted demands, and significantly improve common-case performance.</p><p>Based on this insight, we design a new class of traffic engineering algorithms, called Common-case Optimization with Penalty Envelope (COPE). Our algorithms combine the best of oblivious routing and prediction-based optimal routing. The penalty bound component of COPE is inspired by the pioneering work of oblivious routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. Thus, COPE can bound the worst-case performance penalty to ensure acceptable performance when the network experiences unpredictable changes. But unlike oblivious routing, COPE optimizes routing for predicted demands to achieve high efficiency under normal network conditions. Therefore COPE can achieve close-to-optimal performance in the common case in our real traffic traces, whereas oblivious routing can be 30% -90% worse than optimal.</p><p>We extend COPE to deal with interdomain routing. To handle the point-to-multipoint nature of interdomain demands and the dynamics of interdomain routes, we compute routing that is robust to changes in interdomain routes and yet responsive to traffic patterns.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we overview the related work. In Section 3, we present common-case optimization with penalty envelope (COPE). In Section 4, we compare the performance of COPE with the state-of-art approaches us-ing real traffic traces and network topologies. We further extend COPE to handle interdomain routing, and describe our preliminary results in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>There is a large body of literature on traffic engineering. In the interest of brevity, we review only the most related work.</p><p>Intradomain traffic engineering has received significant attention in the research community. Many interesting traffic engineering algorithms and mechanisms have been proposed. Due to the flexibility and increasing popularity of MPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, many recent studies focus on MPLS-based traffic engineering. We broadly classify this work into the following two categories: (i) traffic engineering for predicted traffic demands, and (ii) oblivious routing.</p><p>The algorithms in the first category share the following features: they maintain a history of observed traffic demand matrices, and they optimize for the representative traffic demand matrices extracted from the observed traffic during a certain history window. For example, Sharad et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> use a traffic matrix in a one-hour window during daily peaks as the representative demand. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50]</ref> consider multiple representative traffic matrices and find an optimal set of routes to minimize expected or worst-case cost for these representative matrices. Note that in their approach, the worst case is only among the samples, not all possible traffic matrices. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>, Zhang and Ge try to identify critical matrices from past history, and then conduct traffic engineering based on these matrices. It might be possible to extend prediction-based optimization using robust optimization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>), but it will be challenging to estimate the variation set of parameters. MATE <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and TeXCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> conduct online traffic engineering and react to instantaneous traffic demands. An advantage of these dynamic algorithms is that if they can converge quickly, they do not need to collect many samples or make prediction. However, when there are significant and fast traffic changes, these algorithms can experience a large transient penalty, as we will show in Section 4.</p><p>The second category of algorithms is oblivious routing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>). In oblivious routing, routes are computed to optimize the worst-case performance over all traffic demands. Therefore the computed routes are prepared for dynamic changes in traffic demands. In their pioneering work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, Applegate and Cohen propose an efficient algorithm to compute the worstcase oblivious routing for real networks. They also extend oblivious routing to compute failure scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. They found that the oblivious ratio is typically around a factor of 2. A penalty as high as 100% may be acceptable when traffic demands are completely unpredictable, but it is a high cost to pay under predictable demands. In other words, oblivious routing takes a pessimistic point of view and may not be appropriate in relatively stable periods or stable networks.</p><p>Our approach is inspired by both prediction-based routing and oblivious routing, and combines the best of both approaches. It optimizes routing for predicted demands to achieve high efficiency under normal network conditions; in the meantime it also bounds the worst-case performance penalty to ensure acceptable performance when the network experiences unpredictable changes.</p><p>There are also recent studies on the interaction of intradomain traffic engineering with interdomain routes and traffic. Examples include evaluation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>) and design (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>). Recently, researchers observed that intradomain traffic engineering within an AS can cause substantial traffic changes outside the AS (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>). For example, Agarwal et al. report in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> that for an operational tier-1 ISP, intradomain traffic engineering can cause up to 25% of its traffic to a neighboring AS to shift the exit point. Such traffic changes could trigger routing changes at the neighboring AS, and result in network instability. Motivated by these studies, we further extend COPE to handle interdomain routing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">OPTIMAL TE WITH TOLERANCE</head><p>In this section, we focus on a single AS. We assume that the egress point of each external destination is known and fixed. We will extend to the case of interdomain routing in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Background Definitions</head><p>One major objective of the traffic engineering of an AS is to determine routing so as to minimize congestion. For concreteness, in this paper we measure network congestion using metrics based on maximum link utilization (MLU), as it is a commonly used metric in many studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>). Another possibility would be to use network cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref> to measure congestion. Our scheme is directly applicable to optimizing for this alternative metric. We will discuss generalization in Section 3.3.</p><p>An AS is represented by a graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of routers, and E is the set of network links. The capacity of link (i, j) from node i to node j is denoted by c(i, j). For intradomain routing, we assume that the graph is stable during the operation. When the network topology changes (e.g., a link that carries substantial amount of traffic fails), the routing computed by traffic engineering is no longer valid and has to be updated. For important intradomain links, a good recovery strategy is to pre-compute routing for each failure scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. Our COPE algorithms can be extended to deal with such scenarios.</p><p>The input to traffic engineering is traffic demand matrices (TM). We represent a TM as a set of traffic demands D = {d ab |a, b ∈ V }, where d ab is the demand for the origin-destination (OD) pair a → b.</p><p>The output of traffic engineering is routing. Since around half of the ISPs run MPLS in their core <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, and more ASes are starting to deploy MPLS, we focus our study on MPLS-based routing. Slightly different from MPLS-style path routing, we use link-based routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>. A link-based routing f is specified by a set of values f = { f ab (i, j)|a, b, i, j ∈ V }, where f ab (i, j) specifies the fraction of demand from a to b that is routed over the link (i, j). One can convert link-based routing to standard MPLS path-based routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>, to shortest-path implementable routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, and to OSPF equal weight-split routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. As we show in Appendix, we can incorporate shortest-path implementation considerations by adding penalty terms into performance metrics. Unless otherwise stated, routing refers to link-based routing in this paper.</p><p>For f to be a routing, the values of f ab (i, j) for the OD pair a → b should specify a flow of value 1 from a to b. For an actual demand d ab for the OD pair a → b, the contribution of this demand to the flow on a link (i, j) is d ab f ab (i, j). The constraints on the routing variables { f ab (i, j)} are flow conservation and non-negativity, which can be defined by the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">   ∀a = b, ∀i = a, b : ∑ (i, j)∈E f ab (i, j) -∑ ( j,i)∈E f ab ( j, i) = 0; ∀a = b : ∑ (a, j)∈E f ab (a, j) -∑ ( j,a)∈E f ab ( j, a) = 1; ∀(i, j) ∈ E : f ab (i, j) ≥ 0.</formula><p>(1) The maximum link utilization (MLU) of a routing f on a TM D is defined as the maximum of traffic to capacity ratios of all links:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U( f , D) = max (i, j)∈E ∑ a,b d ab f ab (i, j) c(i, j) .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>An optimal routing for a given TM D is a routing that minimizes the maximum link utilization. Formally, the optimal utilization for a TM D is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">OU(D) = min f is a routing U( f , D). (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>The performance ratio of a given routing f on a given TM D is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P( f , D) = U( f , D) OU(D) .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>It measures how far the routing f is from being optimal on TM D. P( f , D) = 1 indicates that the routing f is optimal. A higher ratio indicates that the performance is farther away from the optimal.</p><p>To account for fluctuations in network traffic, we may consider multiple traffic demand matrices. Given a set of TMs D, there are multiple ways to extend a performance metric defined on a single TM D to the set D. Since our objective is on robustness, we consider the worst case extension of U( f , D) and P( f , D).</p><p>Extending U( f , D), we define the maximum MLU of a routing f on the set D as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">U( f , D) = max D∈D U( f , D). (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>We refer to a routing that minimizes the maximum MLU on D as an MLU optimal routing on D, and the corresponding maximum MLU as the optimal MLU on D.</p><p>Extending P( f , D), we define the maximum performance ratio of a routing f on the set D as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P( f , D) = max D∈D P( f , D). (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>We refer to a routing that minimizes the maximum performance ratio on D as a performance-ratio optimal routing on D, and the corresponding maximum performance ratio as the optimal performance ratio on D. When D is the complete traffic demand space containing all non-negative traffic demands, the performance-ratio optimal routing is referred to as the oblivious routing, and the optimal performance ratio is referred to as the oblivious ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Optimal TE with Convex-Hull Prediction</head><p>We start with a type of robust prediction-based TE algorithms. Assume that a traffic engineering system has collected a set of TMs {D 1 , . . . , D H } during some time interval, where H is the number of TMs collected. To compute the routing for the next interval, the TE system needs to predict the TM that may appear during the next interval. There can be many predictors. A large class of predictors (e.g., exponential moving average) essentially estimate the TM of the next interval as a convex combination of the previously seen TMs. Aggregating the predictions of all such predictors, we obtain the convex hull of {D 1 , . . . , D H }.</p><p>Let D be the convex hull of the set of TMs {D 1 , . . . , D H }. More specifically, the convex hull can be constructed using convex combinations of the TMs in D, namely, ∑thDh, where t h is a coefficient between 0 and 1, ∑ h t h = 1, and D h is the h-th traffic matrix. Then the problem of optimal TE with convex-hull prediction is to compute the MLU or performance-ratio optimal routing over the set D.</p><p>One advantage of a convex-hull-based predictor is its monotonicity (i.e., if the convex hull is continuously maintained, it will always grow). Specifically, the monotonicity property leads to the following stability result: PROPOSITION 1. If interdomain BGP stability condition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>) is satisfied, then intradomain traffic engineering using convex hull eventually converges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Common-Case Optimization with Penalty Envelope (COPE)</head><p>The convex-hull-based TE is effective when future demands fall into the convex hull. However, traffic fluctuation may make future demands fall outside the convex hull. In this case, the performance may degrade significantly. One way to handle this issue is to expand the convex hull to include more traffic demands. We can expand the corresponding convex hull by letting the convex combination coefficients t h take values less than 0 or larger than 1. Then we can optimize routing for all traffic demands that fall into the expanded convex hull. Such expansion could help us to tolerate changes in traffic demands to a certain extent. However, there is a significant trade-off between the degree of expansion and the performance optimality. In an extreme, the convex hull can be expanded to include all traffic demands, which results in oblivious routing. This is robust against arbitrary possible traffic changes, but does not provide the best performance for normal demands.</p><p>To address the problem, we separate the optimization for the common (predicted) cases and the bound on the worst cases. In particular, we propose a novel approach based on the notion of penalty envelope. It guarantees worst-case performance under arbitrary possible traffic demand while achieving close-to-optimal performance under predictable demands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEFINITION 1. A routing f is said to have MLU (or performanceratio) penalty envelope r if the maximum MLU (or performance ratio) of f on the whole set of possible traffic demands is no more than r.</head><p>A penalty envelope restricts the set of possible routing to those with maximum MLU or performance ratio less than or equal to r. With the penalty envelope as a safeguard, a prediction-based TE algorithm can then search the optimal routing f for the predicted traffic demands, so long the routing satisfies the penalty envelope. We call such a scheme common-case optimization with penalty envelope (COPE).</p><p>The general COPE scheme can be defined as follows. Let X be the set of all possible TMs, and D ⊂ X the set of predicted TMs. Let o( f , x) be the objective function of applying routing f to TM x. Let o( f , D) be the aggregated objective function on the set D. The aggregation can be done, for example, by taking the maximum, or by taking some type of weighted average. Let c( f , x) be the penalty function. Note that for both the objective and penalty functions, lower values are better. It can also be the case that o( f , x) = c( f , x). Then the general setting is to find the routing f that minimizes o( f , D), under the constraint that the penalty over the whole set X of possible traffic demands (and thus includes those in X -D) is bounded by a penalty envelope r. Formally, the formulation is: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the basic idea of the COPE scheme. This scheme gives us a novel, simple, yet effective tool to handle dynamic networks with mostly normal traffic but sometime unexpected (yet possible) traffic demands.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">min f o( f , D) subject to f is a routing, i.e., (1) ; ∀x ∈ X : c( f , x) ≤ r.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Implementing Penalty Envelope</head><p>There are two remaining issues in implementing penalty envelope. The first is how to choose the penalty envelope r. The algo- rithm we use is the following. First, we compute c * (X) = min f ,x∈X c( f , x). Then we set r = αc * (X), where α is a scale-up factor. As we will show in Section 4, by choosing α slightly higher than 1, we can achieve performance close to optimal for most common cases.</p><p>The second key challenge to the COPE framework is whether we can efficiently incorporate penalty envelope into prediction-based TE optimization. Below, we consider three cases and illustrate how they can be efficiently implemented.</p><p>In the first case, we consider a penalty envelope on the absolute value of MLU on the set of possible traffic demands (i.e., the set X ) which satisfy access capacity constraints. The problem can be formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">min o( f , D) (7) subject to f is a routing; ∀ links l, ∀d ab ≥ 0 such that ∑ b∈V d ab ≤ R OUT a , ∑ b∈V d ba ≤ R IN a , ∑ ab d ab f ab (l)/c(l) ≤ r,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where R OUT a and R IN a are the aggregated capacities of inbound and outbound access links of node a, respectively; they have equal values when access links have equal capacities in both directions. In this formulation, r is an upper bound on MLU.</p><p>The constraints <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref> are not standard LP formulation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluation Methodology</head><p>Dataset description: We evaluate our algorithms using both real and synthetic data. We use the real topologies and traffic demand matrices from Abilene and a major tier-1 ISP in US (anonymized as US-ISP). For Abilene, we collected the router-level topology and 6-month worth of traffic demands from Abilene Observatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Our dataset is available at <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. For US-ISP, we rely on a PoP-level model, which differs from the real router-level topology and traffic demands, yet still illustrates the scope and power of the methods proposed here. In addition, we use the PoP-level Abovenet topology inferred by RocketFuel <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. We use OC192 as the capacity for links in the Abovenet topology, and use the gravity model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref> described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> to generate synthetic traffic demands. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the topologies in use, their oblivious ratios, and the default performance-ratio penalty envelopes used in evaluation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarizes the real traces in use. Note that for proprietary reasons, we omit the numbers of nodes and links of US-ISP in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance metrics:</head><p>We use the following two performance metrics to compare different algorithms: (i) maximum link utilization (MLU) as defined in Equation (2); and (ii) performance ratio as defined in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>). For both metrics, lower values indicate more efficient resource utilization, and hence are preferred. Note that the MLU defined in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) allows utilization to be above 100% when the traffic demand is large, while in practice, link utilization cannot exceed 100%. To be consistent with terminologies used by other authors, we use MLU with the understanding that it means traffic intensity and can exceed 100%. Also note that in our real-trace-based evaluations, we assume that traffic demands do not change as a function of the performance of a TE algorithm. When a TE algorithm performs badly and leads to network overload, TCP flows might be able to react and reduce network demand, resulting in lower demand than that happened in the real traces. However, this leads to reduced network throughput.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithms:</head><p>We categorize the algorithms we evaluate into the following three classes: (i) oblivious routing, (ii) prediction-based TE, and (iii) COPE. For all algorithms, we compute the routing by solving the corresponding linear programs using CPLEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. By default, CPLEX uses dual simplex method to solve linear programs, but this is a poor choice for COPE. Given the particular structure of our problem formulation, we use the barrier method without crossover <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</p><p>• Oblivious routing (oblivious): We compute the routing that gives the optimal oblivious ratio using the algorithm described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</p><p>• TE: We evaluate the following three algorithms in this category. The first one requires routing update every time interval (i.e., 1 hour in US-ISP, and 5-minutes in Abilene), whereas the latter two require routing update once a day. We have also conducted experiments using the Abilene traces, with predictions based on traffic of the preceding week and routing update every week, and the results are similar.</p><p>-Dynamic (dynamic): At the beginning of each interval, we compute the optimal routing based on the traffic demand in the previous interval, and apply it to the traffic in the current interval. This algorithm models online traffic engineering (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>). Note that the change in traffic demand from the previous interval can result in less efficient routing, compared to the optimal for the current interval. -Peak traffic demand (peak): At the beginning of each day, an optimal routing is computed based on the traffic demand in the peak interval (in terms of the total volume of traffic) of the previous day (for US-ISP) or the previous day and the same day of the previous week (for Abilene). This scheme has been suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. -Multiple traffic matrices (multi): At the beginning of each day, an optimal routing is computed based on a set of traffic matrices collected. We use the previous day's traffic matrices to compute routing for US-ISP, and use the traffic matrices in the previous day and the same day of the previous week to compute routing for Abilene. This algorithm is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. In addition, we also evaluate its variant suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, which selects traffic matrices of 6 consecutive intervals with the highest total volume of traffic. The results are similar and omitted for the interest of brevity.</p><p>• COPE: We evaluate two versions of COPE. For both of these two versions, we optimize routing based on the convex hull constructed from the set of traffic matrices collected from the previous day (for US-ISP), or from the previous day and the same day last week (for Abilene), subject to a performanceratio penalty envelope on all non-negative traffic demands. Both versions require routing update only once a day, and are cheap to implement. The two versions differ only in their objective functions.</p><p>-Minimizing the performance ratio (COPE-ratio): To optimize for performance ratio as the objective function over a convex set, we adopt the technique developed in Section 3.4 to handle penalty envelope on a convex set. Note that we also refer to COPE-ratio as COPE for short.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-Minimizing MLU (COPE-MLU): This version of COPE</head><p>is a variation of COPE-ratio which uses the absolute value of MLU, instead of performance ratio, as its objective function. Note that we can consider COPE-MLU as an extension of multi with penalty envelope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation Results</head><p>US-ISP: First, we evaluate the performance of different algorithms using US-ISP, a large tier-1 US ISP. For confidentiality, we cannot report absolute MLU for US-ISP. Instead, we report relative MLU normalized by MLU opt,max , where MLU opt,max is the highest maximum link utilization under the optimal routing over the entire month. Note that there are a small fraction of intervals without traffic demand information in the trace and we exclude those intervals in our evaluations. We first compare the algorithms using performance ratio as the metric. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> compares oblivious routing with prediction-based TE. It plots the performance ratio versus the time interval sorted based on the performance ratio. Each time interval spans 1 On one hand, we observe that prediction-based TE out-performs oblivious routing in most cases. For example, the performance ratio under the prediction-based algorithms is less than 1.2 for about half of the time intervals. Among the prediction-based algorithms, dynamic performs the best in the common case. This is expected as it updates every interval, while the others update every day. In comparison, the performance ratio of oblivious routing is above 1.5 for almost all of the intervals. On the other hand, the largest performance ratio under oblivious routing is 2.0355, whereas the largest performance ratios of prediction-based algorithms are all above 3.5, with multi even goes to higher than 8. Note that we limit the y-axis to 8 so that we can easily see the difference under normal traffic. The prediction-based algorithms incur large performance ratios because the inaccurate traffic prediction makes them perform significantly worse than the optimal. These results indicate that prediction-based TE is good at optimizing common-case performance, but suffers from large performance penalty when traffic demands change significantly. On the other hand, oblivious routing is good at handling unexpected traffic, but suffers on common-case performance. Neither class of algorithms dominates the other.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> plots the performance ratios of the COPE algorithms, oblivious routing, and the common-case best-performing dynamic algorithm. Note that in order to display the curves clearly, we have truncated the performance ratio of dynamic, whose performance ratio will shoot up well beyond 2.2. We observe that for the common case, COPE algorithms achieve performance ratio which is about 6% higher than the dynamic algorithm, and significantly outperform oblivious routing; for the worst case (in the traces), COPE algorithms even out-perform oblivious, and significantly out-perform dynamic prediction-based routing. Thus, COPE achieves the best of both.</p><p>Next, we compare the algorithms using normalized MLU as the metric. Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows time series plots of normalized MLU under  various routing schemes. From Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>(a), we can see that without penalty envelope, the prediction-based routing schemes can result in large spikes in normalized MLU. On the other hand, the normalized MLU of oblivious routing never exceeds 1.6, showing the robustness of oblivious routing. However, from Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>(b), we observe that the robust performance of oblivious routing is surpassed by COPE and COPE-MLU. They consistently yield lower link utilization than oblivious routing. We observe reduction in normalized MLU up to 56%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abilene traces:</head><p>The results of the US-ISP traces are normalized.</p><p>Next we evaluate the algorithms using the public Abilene traces and show absolute values of MLU. Since COPE and COPE-MLU perform similarly, we report only COPE. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> compares the algorithms in terms of performance ratio. It plots the performance ratio versus the time interval sorted based on the performance ratio. Each time interval spans 5 minutes. We make the following observations. First, predictions based on either multiple traffic matrices or peak traffic matrix perform poorly, with a performance ratio greater than 2 for about half of the intervals. Second, although dynamic routing achieves close-tooptimal performance ratio most of the time, the performance ratio can occasionally get as high as 6.7. Third, even though oblivious routing has better performance ratio Abilene traces than on US-ISP traces, COPE still out-performs oblivious routing for about 80% of the intervals.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> plots the MLU achieved by the algorithms during 3 days of the Abilene traces when traffic spikes happen. For clarity we zoom in to a few intervals in the day. We make the following three observations. First, on April 10, traffic engineering using multiple traffic matrices or peak matrix may drive the traffic intensity of the bottleneck to be 240% of its link capacity (e.g., at interval 161), while the optimal utilization is less than 50%. This traffic intensity can lead to high packet loss rates and/or router crashes. Second, the dynamic algorithm exhibits interesting behavior. On April 10 and 14, it drives the traffic intensity of the bottleneck link to over 100% of its link capacity during some time periods (e.g., 120% on April 10 at interval 159, and 181% on April 14 at interval 110). On the other hand, on April 12, it always achieves close-to-optimal performance. Closer examination of the traffic of the three days identifies that on April 12, there is a traffic ramp-up process, and thus the dynamic algorithm can adjust and performs well. However, on April 10 and 14, there is no such a ramp-up process before the spikes, and traffic changes rapidly; thus the dynamic algorithm overloads the network. Third, COPE and oblivious perform well under traffic spikes.</p><p>We next evaluate the performance of the algorithms when traffic is relatively steady and there are no traffic spikes. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref> shows that for Friday, April 9, 2004 (all other days in the one-week period from April 9 to April 15 contain spikes). We make the following observations. First, during this normal-traffic day, the utilization of the network is low-the optimal MLU is only around 6%. This is typical of Abilene, which is over-provisioned. Second, the MLU achieved by using multiple traffic is about twice that of the optimal. This is because the traffic demands used for route computation do not match well with the real traffic, thus resulting in a large performance penalty. Third, the MLU achieved by oblivious routing is about 1.3 times optimal. This is better than the oblivious ratio of 1.853 for the Abilene network. However, a 30% performance penalty could still be large, especially if the network is heavily loaded. In comparison, the MLU of COPE is within 5% of optimal, and comparable to the dynamic algorithm under stable demands. Abovenet: Next we evaluate the performance of COPE and oblivious routing using Abovenet topology. Since its traffic demands are  not available, we use the gravity model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref> described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> to generate sample synthetic traffic demands. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref> summarizes the results. The figure is a scatter plot, where each point represents one sample. The x-axis is the optimal MLU for the sample traffic matrix, and the y-axis is the MLU achieved by COPE or oblivious routing. In this evaluation, COPE uses a penalty envelope of 2.05, while the oblivious ratio of Abovenet is 2.014. In other words, the penalty envelope of COPE is only 2% more than the worst-case bound of oblivious routing. Interestingly, relaxing the worst-case bound slightly is sufficient to allow COPE to consistently achieve close-to-optimal performance. In comparison, the MLU of oblivious routing is much higher, up to 1.9 times of the optimal MLU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of penalty envelope:</head><p>There is a trade-off in choosing different values of penalty envelope. When the value of the penalty envelope is high, the penalty guarantee is weak; however, a higher value of envelope leaves more room for optimizing common-case performance. When the envelope is set to be a very large value, the algorithm becomes predictionbased routing. On the other hand, when the value of the envelope is low, the penalty guarantee is strong; but not much room is left for optimizing common-case performance. When the penalty envelope is equal to the oblivious ratio of the whole possible traffic set, the scheme becomes oblivious routing.</p><p>To evaluate the effects of the penalty envelope, we study the performance of the US-ISP and Abilene traces as we vary the penalty envelope. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref> shows the results. Note that the time interval of the US-ISP traces is an hour, while that of the Abilene is 5 minutes. Note also that we choose a 10-day period for the US-ISP traces, and choose a one-week period from April 9 to April 15 for the Abilene traces, as they best demonstrate the effects of penalty envelope.</p><p>We observe that as we increase the value of penalty envelope, the performance of most intervals improves. For example, for the US-ISP traces, the medium performance ratio (i.e., the performance ratio at the middle of the sorted intervals) decreases by 23% as we increase the penalty envelope from 2.05 (the oblivious ratio) to 2.2; for the Abilene traces, the medium performance ratio decreases by 18% as we increase the penalty envelope from 1.85 (the oblivious ratio) to 2.0. When we increase the envelope beyond 2.2 for US-ISP and 2.0 for Abilene, however, the performance improvement is small. Since a larger value of penalty envelope implies larger potential worst-case performance ratio, 2.2 appears to be a good penalty envelope for US-ISP, and 2.0 for Abilene. In addition, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref> shows that by choosing a penalty envelope slightly higher than the oblivious ratio, we achieve about 20% performance improvement for both US-ISP and Abilene. Note that US-ISP and (a) US-ISP traces.  Abilene have typical topologies that are representative for a wide range of networks. These results suggest that by increasing the penalty envelope to be just 10% above the lowest possible, we can already have enough room to optimize common-case performance. Summary: Prediction-based algorithms can pay serious performance penalty when large traffic changes happen. They can drive traffic intensity to be over link capacity when the optimal network utilization is well below 100%. Oblivious routing pays performance penalty under normal traffic, driving utilization to be 30% to higher than optimal in our evaluations. COPE avoids the performance penalties of both, and combines the best of both. Compared with the prediction-based algorithms, COPE retains their closeto-optimal performance under expected traffic demands, but avoids surge in network utilization and performance ratio under large traffic changes. Compared with oblivious routing, COPE also guarantees worst-case performance, but avoids the performance penalty of oblivious routing under predictable demands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">TRAFFIC ENGINEERING WITH INTERDOMAIN ROUTING</head><p>In this section, we develop a light-weight mechanism to handle interdomain routing. As we point out in Section 1, interdomain routing introduces two challenges. The first is point-to-multipoint demand; that is, there can be multiple equally-good egress points to a given external (i.e., interdomain) destination prefix in the BGP decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Thus, COPE needs to break the tie and assign the egress point of each external destination. Since egress links may become the bottlenecks of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, this tie-breaking can affect the congestion of the network. Second, there are a large number of external destination prefixes each with their own set of egress points. ISPs have less control over interdomain routes, but some changes in the availability of interdomain routes can cause significant shifts of traffic. Thus, COPE should compute a routing that is robust to the traffic changes caused by changes of interdomain routes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">COPE with Interdomain Routing</head><p>Our high-level approach is a two-step process. In the first step, we convert the point-to-multipoint interdomain problem to a pointto-point intradomain problem in a topology extending the intradomain topology. By solving the latter problem, we obtain an assignment of external destinations to their egress points. This gives us point-to-point ingress-egress (IE) traffic matrices involving only intradomain nodes. In the second step, we apply COPE to the IE matrices to compute an intradomain routing. Since COPE tolerates traffic variations, the computed routing is robust against traffic variations due to shifts of egress points caused by dynamic interdomain routes. Specifically, in the first step, we group external destination prefixes that share the same set of stable egress points into an equivalence class. Each equivalence class is represented by a virtual destination. We estimate the aggregated traffic demands to each virtual destination, and obtain origin-destination (OD) traffic demands. Then we construct an extended graph G ′ , as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>, which includes the intradomain topology, the peers of the AS, the peering links, and the virtual destination nodes. We connect each virtual destination node with its corresponding peers using virtual links with infinite capacity. We apply COPE to the resulting topology G ′ to compute a robust routing. In particular, this routing will tell us how traffic to a virtual destination be split among its connected peers. Guided by the splitting ratios, we assign the egress point of each external destination prefix to approximate these ratios. This assignment of egress point can be implemented BGP using local preference values. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16</ref> summarizes the algorithm.</p><p>In the second step, using the splitting ratios, we first compute ingress-egress (IE) traffic matrices involving only intradomain nodes. Then we use the IE matrices to compute a robust intradomain routing. To be robustness against possible large changes in traffic demands (e.g., traffic change when a peer is down and many external destinations change egress points), we apply COPE to compute intradomain routing. The algorithm is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17</ref>. Note that unlike in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16</ref>, here the inputs of COPE are the ingress-egress traffic matrices and the intradomain topology (which does not include peering links). This is important because we want to ensure that when peers or peering links go up and down, the penalty envelope of the resulted routing is not affected.</p><p>When the status of a peering link changes, the OD traffic that goes through this link is equally split over the alternative links that 1. Group traffic demands that share the same set of egress points into an equivalence class, EQ. 2. For each EQ, derive its pseudo OD demand that consists of all the OD demands belonging to EQ 3. Initialize G ′ to include intradomain topology, peers, peering links, and virtual nodes representing EQ's 4. Connect virtual to its corresponding peers a virtual link with infinite capacity 5. Apply COPE to compute routing on G ′ for the pseudo demands 6. Derive the splitting ratios based on the routes 7. Assign interdomain prefixes to egress points are available for routing the OD demand. This change does not affect intradomain routing, since intradomain routing is robust to traffic changes through the use of penalty envelope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Evaluation Results</head><p>Next we present our preliminary evaluation of COPE in dealing with interdomain routing dynamics.</p><p>We first extend the Abilene topology. From those ASes that peer with Abilene, we choose two (ESNET and DREN) and add them as virtual destinations. Each one represents a collection of interdomain destination prefixes. ESNET has 3 peering links with Abilene, and DREN has 4. For each peering link, we insert an AS in between. Therefore, in the final topology, Abilene has 3 neighboring ASes connecting to ESNET, and 4 connecting to DREN. The capacities of the peering links connecting Abilene to the inserted neighboring ASes are assigned using the actual peering link capacities. The oblivious routing ratio for this new topology is 2.039.</p><p>Next we determine the total demands from a router in Abilene to ESNET and DREN. Due to lack of good models for interdomain traffic matrices, we generate synthetic interdomain traffic demands using the Abilene traces as follows. We assume that a random portion (uniform from 0 to 0.5) of the traffic from a router in Abilene to the 3 border routers connecting to ESNET is actually targeted to ESNET. We similarly derive interdomain traffic demands to DREN.</p><p>We apply the algorithm described in Section 5.1 to the above derived topology and traffic demands. We set the penalty envelope to 2.2. We evaluate two failure scenarios: 1) a peering link connecting to ESNET (link 11) is down; and 2) both a link connecting to ESNET (link 11) is down, and a link connecting to DREN (link 15) is down.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">18</ref> shows the time series plot of MLU for Thursday, <ref type="bibr">March 11, 2004</ref>. At the 145-th time interval, links 11 and 15 fail and remain failed until the end of the day. We include 4 curves in the plot: optimal with no link failures (i.e., performance should the links not fail), optimal with the link failures, COPE without link failures, and COPE with the link failures. We observe that when the two links fail, the MLU of COPE increases; but the performance penalty is small. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19</ref> evaluates the performance ratio of COPE under link failures, for the time period from <ref type="bibr">March 8, 2004</ref> to <ref type="bibr">March 14, 2004</ref>. It plots the sorted performance ratios of COPE under the following three (i) there is no failure, (ii) only link 11 is down, and (iii) both links 11 and 15 are down. We observe that when only link 11 is down, the performance degradation of the network under COPE is small. When two links are down, COPE has a higher performance ratio compared to the first two scenarios. However, even then the performance is mostly within 30% of optimal. Finally, we note that the performance ratios are always within the penalty envelope, and during most of the intervals, the performance ratios are well below the penalty envelope. Summary:While preliminary, these results show that COPE is promisin handling interdomain route dynamics. As part of future work, we plan to further evaluate COPE in more diverse scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we propose a novel scheme of traffic engineering: common-case optimization with penalty envelope (COPE), a class of traffic engineering algorithms that optimize for the expected scenarios while providing worst-case guarantee for unexpected scenarios. Using extensive evaluations based on real topologies and traffic traces, we show that COPE combines the best of prediction-based routing and oblivious routing, and can achieve efficient resource utilization under a wide variety of scenarios.</p><p>There are several avenues for future work. First, in this paper we focus on MLU. It is useful to apply COPE for optimizing other performance metrics. Second, we are interested in implementing COPE in a real network, and gain operational experience. Third, it will be interesting to find a way to dynamically detect that the common case traffic has changed and the network should recompute. Fourth, we believe that the general principle behind the design of COPE, optimizing for the common-cases while providing worstcase guarantee, can be applicable to many dynamic environments. We plan to explore other applications of this general principle.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: General COPE framework.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A. SHORTEST-PATH-IMPLEMENTABLE INTRADOMAIN TE</head><p>The link-based routing computed by COPE can be implemented by path-based routing such as MPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. In this section, we seek a mechanism which enables us to compute routing that can be implemented by OSPF-style shortest path routing, with an appropriate set of positive link weights. Formally, A routing f ab (i, j) is shortestpath-implementable if there exists a set of positive link weights, such that any path p carrying positive flows for OD pair a → b is a shortest path from a to b.</p><p>From the above definition, it can be shown that a routing ab (i, j) is shortest-path-implementable if and only if there exists a set of link weights {w(i, j)|(i, j) ∈ E} and corresponding shortest distances {U(i, j)|i, j ∈ V }, such that:</p><p>Given ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">18</ref>), if f ab (i, j) &gt; 0, then i is on the shortest path from a to j, and by induction i is also on the shortest path from a to b. Let</p><p>In view of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref> and the fact that f ab (i, j) ≥ 0, we have that SP( f , w,U) ≥ 0 for any f , w and U satisfying ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), and that ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) is equivalent to SP( f , w,U) = 0. Therefore, if we can compute a routing and its associated w, U such that SP( f , w,U) = 0, we can set link weights of OSPF-style routing protocols according to w(i, j), which makes sure that traffic is always routed through shortest paths. Specifically for COPE, we now introduce w and U as optimization variables and ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) as constraints. We can then add</p><p>as a quadratic constraints to guarantee that the routing f computed is shortest path implementable. Alternatively, we can add</p><p>as a quadratic penalty term to the objective of COPE, where α &gt; 0.</p><p>The added penalty term α • SP( f , w,U) will ensure that the optimization not only minimizes the orginal objective of COPE, but also SP( f , w,U). The scaler α is a very small positive number which is introduced to ensure that the minimization of the original objective of COPE takes higher priority. When this alternative approach is used, the routing computed is no longer guaranteed to be shortest path implementable. However, if the computed routing f , link weights w and corresponding shortest path distances U make SP( f , w,U) small, the routing f is "nearly" shortest path implementable.</p></div>			</div>
