<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Various applications in automotive navigation, robotics, and remote sensing require sensors for processing visual motion that are small, consume little power, and work in real time. Considering the type of environments humans are typically exposed to, we shall use the term "real time" in its common anthropocentric meaning, i.e., for time delays not exceeding a few tens of milliseconds. Since motion-sensing algorithms have a large computational overhead, most realtime machine-vision applications require special-purpose parallel hardware for computing motion across the entire image. Parallel hardware implementations are particularly attractive if image acquisition and motion computation can be integrated on a single silicon chip. Such smart-vision chips could be used in stand-alone applications, such as tracking cars, or as front-ends in conventional machine vision systems [l], <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Because image irradiance is a continuous function of time, asynchronous circuit implementations are preferable to clocked implementations. The latter introduce temporal aliasing artifacts that can significantly compromise timesensitive computations, such as those associated with optical flow.</p><p>Analog processing is more economic in terms of silicon area and power than digital processing of comparable complexity, and thus makes higher pixel densities possible. Its main drawback is its lack of precision, but high-precision motion processing is usually not possible, because of noisy input data and fundamental computational problems associated with the estimation of the velocity field from the optical flow (at best, estimating optical flow is numerically ill-conditioned, and at worst, ill-posed [3], <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>).'</p><p>In this paper, we move in bottom-up fashion from lowlevel issues having to do with photoreceptors to higher-level topics having to do with properties of the entire motion flow field. Most of the issues we discuss are general and pertain to all analog VLSI motion processing systems, though some reflect our own biases and the particular details of circuits that we have built.</p><p>The first stage of all visual motion-processing systems is phototransduction. Consequently, in Section I1 we start by discussing an issue that has been largely ignored but which we believe to be important-how the size of the light-collection area of a photoreceptor affects the photoreceptor's, and consequently the motion sensor's, signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). In Section 111, we review the correlation and gradient motion-processing algorithms, since they have inspired the architectures of many analog VLSI chips.</p><p>lGiven the topic of this paper, we make no distinction here between the optical flow field induced by the time-varying image irradiance and the underlying 2-D velocity field, a purely geometrical concept [3], <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The irradiance was attenuated in steps of factors of ten by interposing neutral density filters between a LED and the photoreceptor. The number given near each curve is the logarithm of the attenuation factor. The slope of each response curve asymptotes to a l / f dependence, characteristic of a first-order low-pass filter. The dBV units refer to signal amplitude with respect to a 1 V signal in decibels. (b) Fall time or the photoreceptor's output voltage signal as a function of the velocity of a moving edge for photoreceptors with different sizes. The fall time is inversely proportional to the velocity of the edge and proportional to the size of the photoreceptor's light-collecting area. This confirms our notion that the fall time is ultimately limited by the time-of-travel of the edge image across the light-collecting area if the photoreceptor's bandwidth is large enough to follow the dynamics of the stimulus. The optical stimulus was a sharp high-contrast edge on a rotating drum with diameter d = 11.4 cm, whose surface was situated I = 29 cm away from the lens imaging it onto the chip. The focal length of the lens was f = 113 mm. The velocity of the edge image on the chip was computed as ( f / l ) ( n t l / T ) where T is the rotation period of the drum.</p><p>In Section IV, we present a survey of various analog VLSI chips that have been reported in the literature. In Section V we analyze what determines the minimum and maximum speeds that a sensor can handle. We calculate how these limits depend on the SNR for a classic correlation (Reichardt) sensor. In Section VI we show how a nonlinear filter with an adaptive time constant as implemented with a simple diode-and-capacitor circuit can be used to design a motion sensor that operates over a large dynamic range. We present theory and data that illustrate the large dynamic range that is achievable. In Section VI1 we describe an implementation of such a motion sensor and present data that shows the working of the sensor over a wide range of velocities, contrasts and light levels. In Section VIII, we discuss how such a motion sensor can be used in singlechip systems for extracting high-level information from the motion-flow field, such as the focus-of-expansion or the time-to-contact with a moving object. We conclude the paper with a short summary in Section IX.</p><p>In this paper, we focus primarily on one-dimensional (1-D) motion-sensing problems. The issues we discuss are all pertinent to two-dimensional (2-D) motion-sensing problems as well; for 2-D problems, however, motion integration [6] (e.g., solving the aperture problem <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>) would need to be implemented on chip as well. Part of this work has been previously reported in [9], [lo], and [381.   11. PHOTORECEPTOR SIZlNG AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE Photoreceptors are an integral part of all visual motionsensing circuitry. The transduction of light to electric current is usually accomplished with a photodiode held at a fixed or nearly fixed reverse bias. The light collection area of the photodiode is an important parameter that affects the performance of the motion sensor in many ways. We shall start by assuming that each pixel has a square lightcollection area of a x a. We illustrate how various system parameters scale with a. We shall only show the forms of the dependence on a without constant factors.</p><p>Our theory and measurements are based on the adaptive photoreceptor characterized extensively in [ 111, but our discussion is of a general nature and applies to many common photoreceptor designs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Spatial and Temporal Filtering</head><p>For a photodiode, the photocurrent I is proportional to Ea2, where E is the irradiance and a2 is the lightcollection area. The total capacitance on the photodiode sensing node is given by the sum of the junction capacitance-proportional to the area a2 of the photodiode's pn junction-and a contribution from parasitics due to the sensing and amplifying circuitry that is part of every photoreceptor. Thus the total capacitance C is proportional to (a2 + p ) , where p is the area-independent contribution from the parasitics. To a good approximation, the photoreceptor can be characterized as a first-order temporal filter. Its bandwidth B (defined in the usual fashion as the frequency at which the response is reduced by 3 dB) is inversely proportional to the total capacitance and increases linearly with the photocurrent.2 Thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U 2 a2 Sp B-- E .</formula><p>The linear dependence of the bandwidth on the irradiance E can be seen from <ref type="bibr">Fig. l(a)</ref>, showing the response of 2The bandwidth is proportional to g / C , where g = I / r ; is the conductance of the photodiode sensing node and Li is a multiple of the thermal voltage k T / q . Since 1. ; is almost always constant, the bandwidth is proportional to I / C . a CMOS photoreceptor to small-signal, white noise for different irradiance levels. The data were provided by Delbriick [ll]. For a given irradiance E , the bandwidth rises with increasing a but eventually asymptotes to a constant value independent of a.</p><p>A sharp moving edge imaged onto a photoreceptor is spatially filtered due to the finite size of the photoreceptor's light-collecting area. Consequently, the rise and fall times of the photoreceptor's output waveform in response to the motion of a sharp irradiance gradient increase with a. In fact, if the photoreceptor does not impose any bandwidth limitations on the rise and fall times, they are limited by the time-of-travel of the edge across the width a. Thus if we define t,f to be the 10-90% rise or fall time, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a ?I t T f --</formula><p>where v is the velocity of the moving step edge and the constant of proportionality is 0.9 -0.1 = 0.8. <ref type="bibr">Fig. l(b)</ref> shows this 1/w dependence for the fall times of two photoreceptors with a = 40 jrm and a = 20 pm, respectively. The fits to the measured data have constants of proportionality of 0.75, and the ratio of the two slopes is two. These numbers agree well with our rather simple theoretical considerations.</p><p>Typical visual patterns include different spatial frequencies. Thus it is of interest to find out how the photoreceptor responds to a given spatial frequency input. A sinusoidal input with spatial frequency f3 and contrast c that is moving with velocity II will be spatially and temporally filtered by the photoreceptor. The effect of the square-box spatial filter is given by a sinc function (sinc(z) = -). The lowpass temporal filter is first-order and characterized by the bandwidth B. Photoreceptors are often designed such that their transient output voltage is proportional to the contrast c = A E / E and independent of the absolute irradiance E .</p><p>The photoreceptor output voltage is then given by</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Noise</head><p>The thermal noise at the photoreceptor output is caused by the amplification of shot-noise diffusion currents in the photodiode and transistors in the photoreceptor. The theory and measurements of thermal noise in subthreshold MOS devices, resistors, and photoreceptors may be found in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. The mean-square thermal voltage noise at the output of the photoreceptor is proportional to k T / C and thus given by (4)</p><p>In practice however, for ac-driven light sources that are typical for indoor environments, optical line noise is the dominant source of noise in the photoreceptor. In the United States, the line frequency of 60 Hz results in 120 Hz The data shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> confirms the prediction of (1) that the 20 pm photoreceptor has a smaller bandwidth than the 40 pm photoreceptor, and therefore starts filtering out the 120 Hz signal at higher light levels.</p><p>'In other countries, the line noise is at 100 Hz due to a line frequency of 50 Ha.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Signal-to-Noise (SLV} Considerations</head><p>We first discuss S/N considerations for the case in which thermal noise is dominant in the photoreceptor (dc-lighting or sunlight conditions). Subsequently, we treat the case in which optical line noise dominates (ac-lighting conditions).</p><p>I ) Thermal Noise: If thermal noise is the dominant form of noise in the photoreceptor, we see from (4) that we can reduce it by increasing a. From (1) we observe that increasing a improves the bandwidth B and reduces the effect of temporal filtering on the signal. From noise and temporal-filtering considerations, therefore, it is advantageous to have a very large photoreceptor width a. However, ( 3 ) implies that increasing a increases spatial blurring, thereby reducing spatial resolution and the output signal of the photoreceptor. From spatial filtering considerations, therefore, it is disadvantageous to increase a. In order to understand which of these effects dominates, we need to examine how they scale with a.</p><p>According to (4), the thermal noise power is reduced as l / ( a 2 + p ) by increasing a. Equation (3) shows that the rising bandwidth with increasing a [see (l)] improves the SNR by increasing the signal. The sinc function has its first zero at fn; = l/a-and we may approximate it by a low-pass spatial filter with a pole at l/a. Hence, the lowest spatial frequencies are unattenuated, while spatial frequencies significantly above 1 /a are attenuated in power like l/a2. Thus, the ratio of signal power to noise power scales like (az + p ) for low spatial frequency inputs, and like (U' + p ) /a' for high spatial frequency inputs, if we assume constant bandwidth. Given that the bandwidth improves with increasing a, the SNR rises even more strongly with increasing a. Therefore, we conclude that if thermal noise is the dominant form of noise in the photoreceptor, the SNR at its output is improved by having a large a. Intuitively, this makes sense, since the way to eliminate intrinsic noise is to average the input over as large a photon-collecting area as possible. However, it is not sufficient to view the output of the photoreceptor in isolation: with increasing a, the thermal noise from the photoreceptor becomes reduced until the thermal noise behavior starts to be dominated by subsequent motion-processing stages and the input-referred thermal noise becomes independent of a. Assuming that this happens for large values of a, we note that the temporal bandwidth is also independent of a. The overall S/N ratio of the system then starts to degrade with increasing a, because of the l/a2 signal attenuation due to spatial filtering.</p><p>2) Optical Line Noise: If optical line noise is the dominant form of noise in the photoreceptor, increasing the size of the photoreceptor does not reduce the noise. In fact, it may be shown that the bandwidth improvement with increasing a increases the 120 Hz noise more than the input signals with lower temporal frequencies. Furthermore, the input signals suffer from spatial filtering and the global optical line noise does not. Therefore, we conclude that if optical line noise is the dominant form of noise in the photoreceptor, the SNR at its output is degraded by having a large a. Note that this conclusion is exactly the opposite of the one we reached for thermal noise. In indoor environments the optical line noise typically dominates the thermal noise, as can be seen from the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. It is therefore advantageous to work with a small a in these cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. General Rectangular Designs</head><p>Our discussion centered on the common case of photoreceptors with light-collection areas of a x a. Typically, such square photoreceptors are chosen for 2-D grids. For 1-D arrays of motion sensors with associated photoreceptor circuitry, the SNR of the photoreceptors is optimized by light-collection areas with dimensions b x a, where b &gt;&gt; a and a is along the motion-computing direction. This strategy allows us to reduce thermal noise (by making b as large as possible) without causing increased spatial filtering of the signal (by keeping a as small as possible).</p><p>For large enough areas (ab &gt;&gt; p ) , the bandwidth is almost independent of area because the junction capacitance is much greater than any parasitic capacitance [see <ref type="bibr">(l)</ref>]. In the presence of optical line noise, the SNR is independent of b for given a and ab &gt;&gt; p , due to the fact that neither the signal nor the noise is affected by b. Before we conclude our discussion of photoreceptor sizing, it is worth mentioning that for 2-D images, the details of the analysis differ because of concerns like edge orientation, but the general tradeoffs with respect to a remain valid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">MOTION ALGORITHMS</head><p>Algorithms for estimating optical flow can be divided into two main groups [6], <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. In intensity-based methods, the image irradiance, or some linearly filtered version of it, is directly used to estimate the optical flow throughout the image. The two most popular types of intensity-based motion algorithms are gradient methods and correlation or spatio-temporal energy methods. Motion algorithms of the second group are known in computer vision as tokenbased methods and are associated in the psychophysical literature with long-range motion. They first extract particular features in the image, such as edges, corners, or higher-level features by using nonlinear operators, and then estimate velocity in a subsequent stage at sparse locations throughout the image by tracking these features across time. All motion-sensing algorithms suffer from the fact that estimating optical flow is at the very least a numerically ill-conditioned and frequently an ill-posed problem [ 3 ] , <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. One key difficulty with methods working on discrete space or time intervals (or both) is known as the correspondence problem: which feature at a given time or location corresponds to what feature at a different time or location <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>.</p><p>As will be shown in Section IV, various analog VLSI velocity sensors have been designed using intensity-based motion algorithms. Accordingly, we will briefly summarize the main features of correlation and gradient algorithms and present their most popular versions. A more detailed review may be found in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, and a comparison of the pros and cons of these algorithms may be found in <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Correlation or Reichardt Algorithm</head><p>The Reichardt algorithm was first proposed to explain the optomotor response to moving patterns in beetles and flies [ 161. In more recent years, similar algorithms-termed second-order or spatio-temporal energy methods-have been proposed to explain motion perception in humans and other primates [17]- <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. Common to all these methods is that the image irradiance E ( $ , t ) is passed through a linear spatio-temporal filter and multiplied with a delayed version of the filtered irradiance from a neighboring receptor. These algorithms calculate a quadratic functional that depends on the velocity and the contrast of the optical input.</p><p>The output of the original Reichardt model <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> is obtained by first multiplying the spatially filtered brightness signal from one photoreceptor with a delayed or low-passfiltered version of the signal from an adjacent photoreceptor, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. This quadratic signal is large when the low-pass filter delay compensates for the time-of-travel due to motion; consequently, for a given stimulus, it is maximum for a particular speed in one direction of motion.</p><p>In an opponency stage, the outputs of two multiplication stages, corresponding to opposite directions of motion, are subtracted and the result is then integrated in time to yield the output of the sensor. Since this operation is akin to an autocorrelation, this sensor is also known as a correlation sensor.</p><p>Note that this sensor is sensitive to the direction of motion, as coded in the sign of the output, but not to velocity as such. Rather, it may be viewed as a linearlyseparable spatial-frequency and temporal-frequency filter.</p><p>A sinusoidal stimulus pattem, E ( x , t ) , may be represented as E ( z , t ) = Eo(1 + c s i n ( k z -wt)), with c denoting the image contrast, k the angular spatial frequency, w = kv the angular temporal frequency, and ' U the velocity of the pattern. If the spacing between neighboring photoreceptors is Az and the time constant of the low-pass filter is 7 , it is straightforward to show that the output of a Reichardt sensor is given by Thus the sensor has its maximum output at the temporal frequency I/' and at the angular spatial frequency n/2Ax, which corresponds to half the Nyquist spatial-sampling rate.</p><p>The temporal frequency w = kv is signed to be positive for velocities in one direction and negative for velocities in the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Gradient Algorithm</head><p>Gradient methods or, more generally, differential methods, exploit the relationship between the velocity and ratios of first-order or higher-order temporal and spatial derivatives of the image irradiance distribution and are commonly used in machine vision [8], [20]- <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. These methods yield a direct estimate of the optical flow field, but the implementation of spatial derivatives with offset-prone analog circuits is problematic.</p><p>Gradient algorithms are based on a priori assumptions about the image brightness (see Section VIII). The simplest gradient algorithm estimates velocity from the constraint d E ( z , t ) / d t = 0, i.e., that the image brightness does not change over time. In the 1-D case, the velocity then amounts to More sophisticated versions [23], <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref> require the computation of higher-order spatial and temporal derivatives; such computations, however, are not suited to implementation with analog VLSI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I v . REVIEW OF ANALOG VLSI MOTION SENSORS</head><p>In the following, we review VLSI implementations of continuous-time, analog motion sensors that implement intensity-based and token-based algorithms. We restrict ourselves to sensors that incorporate the photoconversion stage and the motion-processing circuitry on a single chip.</p><p>The reviewed sensors are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Among the first circuits operating on a gradient algorithm was an "optical mouse" chip for estimating uniform image velocity in two dimensions <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>.5 The circuit consisted of an 8 x 8 array of velocity-sensing elements. Their outputs were averaged to correct for offset effects and the aperture 5The first optical mouse chip built implemented a digital algorithm <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> problem. The circuit effectively measured a single velocity value within a limited range for high contrasts, whereas with decreasing contrast the reported motion tended to zero for a given image velocity. The precision of the local velocity measurements was low due to large circuit offsets and even with the implemented signal aggregation across the entire array the performance was poor.</p><p>Due to the intrinsic difficulty of accurately computing local spatial and temporal derivatives using low-precision hardware <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>, subsequent work concentrated on implementing correlation algorithms, since they show superior numerical stability. A 1-D spatial-correlation sensor was built [28] where a spatially filtered version of the input signal was fed into a circuit that multiplied the delayed signal of one pixel with the undelayed signal of the adjacent pixel on either side. The two signals were averaged along the array and used to interpolate the correlation peak in the subpixel range. For a high-contrast bar stimulus the output signal was approximately linearly dependent on speed. Temporal aliasing was observed when the image was displaced by more than one pixel within a single time delay interval. The spatial response of the input filter was illumination-dependent. Because the shape of the correlation peak for the implemented algorithm depended on the stimulus, the circuit could only measure the velocity of a stimulus to which it had been calibrated.</p><p>Since all purely correlation-based methods yield output signals that strongly depend on contrast and illumination, as well as on velocity, general interest shifted toward hybrid methods that perform correlation-type motion computations on image tokens extracted by low-level feature detectors.</p><p>The circuits described in the remainder of this section used edges as image tokens. They either identified rapid temporal-irradiance transients as temporal edges, or sharp spatial-irradiance gradients as spatial edges.</p><p>One such sensor was inspired by the auditory system of the barn owl and integrated in a 27 element 1-D array <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. At each pixel site, a binary voltage pulse of fixed width was triggered in response to a temporal dark-bright or ON edge. Pulses from adjacent pixels were propagated through two parallel delay lines from opposite directions. The velocity of the edge stimulus was extracted from the position of their meeting point (coincidence detection). For given bias settings, the circuit measured velocity over a range of one order of magnitude across a decade of dc illuminance down to low contrasts. It was not operable under ac incandescent lighting, however, because the optical line noise caused spurious edge signals to be triggered. This problem could only be solved by using additional filtering circuitry. Other drawbacks of the system were the limited detectable velocity range for a given delay setting and the large area consumption of the delay lines.</p><p>A 2-D scheme, implemented as a hexagonal array of 26 x 26 pixels [30], compared the velocity of temporal edges traveling across the image plane with the preset velocity of pulses propagating through delay lines along three directions. If the apparent velocity of an edge along a delay line matched the propagation speed of a pulse in the delay line, this pulse was periodically reinforced and its amplitude increased. If the velocities did not match, the pulses in the delay line gradually decayed. The pulse amplitude at each pixel was measured with a nonlinear circuit. The output signal in response to a traveling edge increased along the delay lines, while the velocity-tuning curve sharpened up. The circuit responded down to low contrasts. The output signal of a given element depended on its position and the apparent velocity, contrast, and sharpness of the moving edge. A population of such arrays, tuned to different velocities, or a single array with adaptive tuning, would be necessary io measure velocity over an extended range. This scheme is therefore not suitable for the monolithic implementation of dense velocity-sensing arrays.</p><p>A binary correlation scheme was implemented in a 1-D array <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>. It used a spatial-edge detector, that convolved the image with a difference-of-exponentials kernel, implemented with two resistive grids with different resistances <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref>. An edge of sufficiently high contrast triggered a voltage pulse of fixed amplitude and width. This pulse was then timed against the pulse from an adjacent pixel that was delayed by a fixed time interval. The output signal was a current pulse with a width equal to the overlap time of the two pulses. The system worked robustly for high-contrast edges under ac or dc lighting. However, it was not sensitive enough to respond to low-contrast edges and its response to nonoptimum velocities was ambiguous.</p><p>While such correlation-based algorithms are interesting models of how motion computations may be carried out in neurobiological circuits, most of them are unsuitable for implementation in integrated circuits that compute extended optical flow fields, because they are tuned to a narrow velocity range and tend to be expensive in silicon area. Algorithms that measure the time-of-travel of an image token between two fixed locations (inversely related to the velocity) are more attractive for implementation in compact arrays.</p><p>A circuit inspired by a model for 1-D direction selectivity in the rabbit retina <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref> was implemented as a 2-D array of 47 x 41 pixels <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>. Inhibitory connections between neighboring pixels in one direction suppressed the response for motion in that direction, called the null direction. In the other direction, the preferred direction, voltage pulses were triggered by temporal ON edges and terminated by inhibition from the neighboring pixel. For low speeds and contrasts, however, the pulse amplitudes and widths were strongly dependent on speed and contrast and the pulses decayed before inhibition set in. For a given stimulus, the output pulse width therefore increased with speed at low speeds and decreased again with higher speeds, where it was limited by inhibition. In the null direction, the output was efficiently inhibited, unless the travel time of the edge was shorter than the onset delay of the inhibition, in which case spurious outputs were observed. The circuit responded down to low contrasts, but contrast-independent velocity measurements were only possible for high contrasts in a very limited velocity range.</p><p>Another time-of-travel chip was implemented in a 5 x 5 array <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. It used a spatial-edge detector as an input stage and measured the time it took an edge to cross a pixel by tracking the maximum of the edge-detector output signal <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. For sharp black-white edge stimuli, the chip showed an approximately inverse relationship of pulse width and speed over three orders of magnitude of speed and six orders of magnitude of ambient lighting. The contrast threshold for edge detection was given as 5%, but the performance of the motion sensor at intermediate and low contrasts was not reported. Velocity was computed along two perpendicular axes in the focal plane with two pairs of motion cells per pixel. No interaction between the two directions was implemented, i.e., no attempt was made to estimate 2-D motion. Due to the large amount of circuitry needed by this algorithm, it does not appear to be unsuitable for implementation in dense arrays.</p><p>Two time-of-travel algorithms were implemented with more compact circuits, that unambiguously encoded 1 -D velocity over considerable velocity, contrast, and illumination ranges. Both used a temporal-edge detector as input stage, that responded to ON edges [9], <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. In one circuit [lo], [31], an edge signal generated a voltage pulse of fixed amplitude and width at each pixel location. The pulses from two adjacent locations were fed into two motion circuits, one for each direction. For motion in the preferred direction, such a motion circuit output a pulse whose width corresponded to the time interval during which the input pulses overlapped. For motion in the null direction no output pulse was generated. The other circuit <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref> was based on a scheme where three adjacent edge detectors contributed to the measurement of a velocity value. In the preferred direction of motion, an edge signal from the first detector facilitated the response of the second detector, whose signal then triggered a binary output voltage pulse. An inhibition signal from the third detector terminated the pulse. In the null direction, inhibition set in first, thereby suppressing the triggering of an output pulse, before being released by the facilitation signal. The outputs of both circuits were contrast-invariant down to approximately 15 % contrast and illumination-invariant over more than two orders of magnitude under ac incandescent room illumination.</p></div>

LIMITS OF OPERATION OF MOTION SENSORS</head><p>When comparing the merits of different motion sensors, it is crucial to understand the ultimate limits on their performance. These limits are important in determining the sensor's dynamic range of operation.</p><p>For a given pixel spacing Ax, the maximum and minimum speeds that a motion sensor can transduce correctly are determined by the smallest and largest time intervals, At,;, and At,,,, that it can handle respectively, according to and The values of Atmin and At,,, may be set by two types of limits, here referred to as parametric and noise limits. We shall discuss the parametric limits briefly and the noise limits in more detail. This choice is made not because parametric limits are less important in practice, but because they are more straightforward to understand and less fundamental than noise limits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Parametric Limits</head><p>The maximum or minimum value of any one circuit parameter in a motion sensor sets limits on At,;, or At,,,.</p><p>For example, in digital systems At,;, is the clock period and At,,, may be the number of periods that can be counted by the largest counter in the system.6 In many pulse-based analog systems, At,;, is set by the smallest width, rise or fall times of particular pulses in the computation. Similarly, At,,, is set by the largest width of particular pulses or by the total number of stages in a pulsedelay line. Parametric limits may be altered by changing the values of the parameters that determine them. In some cases, the technology imposes limits that the user cannot go beyond; for instance, it is hard to achieve rise and fall times shorter than a few nanoseconds in current CMOS technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Noise Limits</head><p>Several motion sensors, such as the Reichardt sensor described earlier, do not have any inherent parametric limits aside from the ones imposed by the implementation technology. If there was no noise in the system, At,,, would be zero and At,,, would be cc and the sensors could operate over an infinite velocity range. So how does noise limit their operation? We will carry out an intuitive analysis to answer this question for the Reichardt sensor.</p><p>Imagine that an infinitely narrow bar of contrast c moves a distance Ax from one location to another and we want to determine its velocity U. We choose an impulsive event, because we want the input to have as fine a resolution as possible so as to be limited by the resolution of the sensor rather than by any limit in the input. Analog motion sensors, like the Reichardt sensor, do not have clocks to measure time; rather, they have filters with state variables. Changes in the values of these state variables between input events encode the passage of time.</p><p>In the classic Reichardt sensor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), the arrival of the bar triggers a first-order, low-pass impulse response of the type in a filter with time constant r. After a time equal to the time-of-travel &amp;/U, the same event arrives at a neighboring location and triggers a short pulse that is 61n practice, in most digital systems, the time interval is fixed by the clock period and Az is measured to estimate velocity. In this case, Ax,,, and Az,i, limits should be used instead of Atmi, and At,,, limits.  <ref type="figure">At,;,,</ref> and<ref type="figure">At,,,</ref> it can process. We can define thesc timc delays to correspond to output signal values one noise floor below the maximum and one noise floor above the minimum signal, respectively. The graph shows these limits for the impulse response S x eqi(-Ax/(.T) of a classical Reichardt sensor as a function of thc normalized time of travel of a bar between the two input receptors. They are a function of the sensor's SNR (aasnmed to bc IO in this example). multiplied with the filter output to produce the output value AX VR = S x exp (().</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(9)</head><p>The value S is a measure of the signal amplitude at the output and is proportional to the square of the contrast. The output of the sensor encodes velocity for a given stimulus because it is a function of the time-of-travel. For the following, we will assume that the output of the system is noisy, characterized by its root-mean-square (rms) noise N . In other words, output values that are within N of each other are not resolvable. In effect, the noise imposes a resolution grid with spacing N on the output signal, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. We define the minimum resolvable time interval At,;, and the maximum resolvable time interval At,,, to correspond to the outputs being within N of the value S for 1) = 00, and within N of the value zero for li = 0, respectively.</p><p>Though the system will respond to smaller times-of-travel, it is not possible to resolve the range of velocities between Az/Atmin and 00, since they all map near S . Likewise, all velocities between zero and AzlAt,,, cannot be resolved for the same reason. In order to compute these minimum and maximum times-of-travel, we need to invert and If we define S / N to be the SNR,7 it follows from (10) and (1 1) that the dynamic range of the Reichardt motion sensor is Using the Taylor series expansion of the natural logarithm, we observe that for large S/N values D R M The maximum level of noise tolerated by this sensor is given by SIN = 2, since in this case Atrr,irl = At,,,, = T In 2 and D R = 1. Expressions (10)-( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) are valid only if SIN 2 2. We will now show how D n can be improved by introducing nonlinear adaptation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NONLINEAR ADAPTIVE FILTERING</head><p>The previous analysis suggests the characteristic properties of a motion sensor with wide dynamic range: in order to reduce At,;,, we need a sharply decaying slope, i.e., a small time constant, at the beginning of the filter's 71n most of the literature, the SNR is defined as S2/iY2 instead of S/N. We depart from convention because our choice avoids having too many square roots in mathematical expressions.</p><p>impulse response. In order to increase At,,,, the decay must slow down with time, i.e., the time constant must increase. Both of these requirements are met by an adaptive nonlinear filter whose time constant is small when its output voltage is large and whose time constant is large when its output voltage is small. In fact, there is a very simple way to build such a filter in electronics. All it takes is a parallel diode-and-capacitor circuit fed by an input current. This circuit is the nonlinear adaptive analog of a first-order filter built with a parallel RC circuit. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(a) illustrates the difference between a simple exponential decay from a parallel RC circuit and the decay from an exponentialelement-and-capacitor circuit. In general, any element with an exponential I-V characteristic in parallel with a capacitor exhibits similar behavior.</p><p>The dynamics of the latter circuit may be computed in closed form by solving a simple nonlinear differential equation. Here we state only the results. If the exponential element has an I-V characteristic given by where VK and IK are the voltage and current parameters that characterize the exponential element, respectively, then after the input current Io is switched off, the current in the exponential element IOut(t) is given by where C is the capacitance. For Io,lt(t) = CVK/t and is independent of the initial input current Io. For large IO, this happens very quickly. The independence of the dynamics on the initial condition is a very useful property for a motion sensor, since we would like measured velocities to be the same irrespective of the contrast of the input signal, especially for strong input signals.</p><p>The voltage on the exponential element is often more convenient to use and report than the current. It is given by As discussed above, for large times the current has a l / t dependence and consequently the voltage has a logarithmic dependence on time. <ref type="bibr">Fig. 5(b)</ref> shows measured voltage traces of a diode-andcapacitor element and theoretical plots according to ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) for various initial currents Io. The convergence of the waveforms irrespective of initial conditions and the logarithmic behavior at large times may be easily seen.</p><p>If the rms noise voltage on the capacitor due to all noise sources is N , then by an analysis very similar to the one in Section 5.2, we can show that and Here S is the initial voltage computed from the initial current IO by S is thus a measure of the signal output amplitude. The dynamic range D R = &amp;,,/At,;, is then given by Note that for this filter, the dynamic range is determined by the SNR and by the value of N with respect to VK. If N is small and S is large compared with V, (i.e., S/N is large),</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">then D R M ( V K / N ) x exp((S1N -1)NlVK). If N is large compared with VK and SIN is large, then D E E exp((S/X ~ ~) N / V K ) .</formula><p>In both cases, the exponential scaling with SIN is superior to the scaling of the Reichardt sensor of ( S / N ) In ( S I N ) . As before, when the noise level reaches half of the signal strength, DE = 1 and the sensor becomes inoperable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. THE FS VELOCITY SENSOR</head><p>The facilitate-and-sample (FS) velocity sensor [ 101 uses the diode-capacitor dynamics of the nonlinear filter described in the previous section to obtain a wide dynamic range. Unlike the Reichardt algorithm, the FS algorithm is token-based. In a first stage, the circuit extracts edges from the image brightness distribution. These can be either temporal or spatial edges, depending on the implementation. The sensor then estimates the time it takes for an edge to travel between two adjacent photoreceptor locations. This time is not computed by correlating edge responses obtained from the two locations; rather, the nonlinear-filter response caused by an edge at one location is sampled by a narrow pulse caused by the arrival of the edge at the adjacent location. This sampling scheme results in the sensor output being independent of contrast for large times-of-travel [see Fig. <ref type="figure">S(b)</ref>], whereas a correlation scheme would result in a dependence on contrast for all times-of-travel, as in the Reichardt sensor.</p><p>The FS sensor is schematically shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(aj. It consists of two temporal-edge detectors (E), two pulse-shaping circuits (P), two motion circuits (M), and a directionselection circuit (Dj. Since the FS sensor has been previously described in detail [9], [lo], we give here only a brief description of the different elements and some performance data.</p><p>Each temporal-edge detector (E) comprises an adaptive photoreceptor circuit converting irradiance transients into voltage transients [ll] and a circuit that converts the positive voltage transients, corresponding to ON edges, into current impulses. Each current impulse generates two voltage pulses, which we call the fast pulse and the slow  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) and a nonlinear adaptive filter built with an exponential element and a capacitor in parallel. The response of the nonlinear filter has a much steeper slope initially and thus a higher sensitivity than that of the RC filter; subsequently, its time constant increases so that its decay becomes eventually much slower than that of the RC filter. The use of such a nonlinear filter in a motion sensor results in a much larger dynamic range than the use of a RC filter, since the sharp slope near the origin reduces At,,;,, while the slow decay after long delays increases At,,,, for a given noise level. For the RC filter a time constant T = 2 s and a maximum signal S = 1.2 V was assumed. The nonlinear filter curve is derived from ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) with I J ~ = 3.5 x F. (b) Measured dynamics of such a nonlinear filter for different initial current conditions. The circuit was activated by current pulses from a temporal-edge detector, such as the one used in the FS motion sensor in response to moving edges of different contrasts c. The measured data (solid lines) is compared with theoretical curves (dashed lines) derived from ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>). Irrespective of the initial condition, the responses eventually converge to the same logarithmic time response. The larger the intial current 10 the more rapid is the convergence. If Io encodes the contrast in the image, as for the measured data, the behavior implies that at sufficiently high contrasts and for sufficiently low velocities, the motion sensor's output is invariant with contrast. pulse respectively, in the pulse-shaping circuit (P) that is coupled to E. The fast pulse is a narrow spike that is a sharpened version of the input current impulse. The slow pulse is the output of a parallel diode-capacitor circuit in response to the current impulse, as described by ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>). Each motion circuit (M) uses the fast pulse generated by an edge at one location to sample and report the voltage of the slow pulse output at the other location. If for a given edge the onset of the slow pulse precedes the fast pulse, the edge is said to move in the motion circuit's preferred direction, otherwise it is said to move in its null direction. Note that the sampled voltage in the null direction contains no information on the speed of the edge triggering the sampling signal, since it is related to the time of arrival of the previous edge. The motion circuit on the right receives the slow pulse Vsl from the left edge detector and the fast pulse Vf, from the right edge detector. Thus its preferred direction is from left to right <ref type="bibr">[Fig. 6(b)</ref>]. Conversely, the motion circuit on the left receives the slow pulse Vs2 from the right edge detector and the fast pulse Vf, from the left edge detector. Thus its preferred direction is from right to left. if the optical stimulus is not spatially aliased, the motion circuit for which the edge moves in the preferred direction reports the higher voltage than the one for which it moves in the null direction. The direction-selection circuit (D) makes use of this fact to set the output voltage for the null direction to zero in order to prevent temporal aliasing.</p><p>As we have seen in Section Vi, the sampled value of the slow pulse in the preferred direction is a monotonic function of the time-of-travel and, if condition ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) is met, independent of the height of the input current impulse, i.e., of edge contrast. Also, since the photoreceptor's transient output voltage is quite invariant with illuminance, so is the motion sensor's output. This means that the output voltage of the motion circuit for which the edge moves in the preferred direction then also encodes speed. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> illustrates the performance of the FS sensor for different illuminances and contrasts.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> velocity measurements over a more extended range are plotted. The response to a 56% contrast edge is compared with the response to electronically generated current pulses fed into the pulse-shaping circuits to simulate an ideal moving edge. The limits of operation of the FS sensor are determined by a combination of parametric and noise considerations that have to do with the details of the photoreceptor, edge-detection, and motion circuits. For stimulus-independent speed-encoding, At,,, is limited by condition (13, whereas direction-selectivity is lost when the width of the sampling pulse (here 5.3 ps) exceeds the time-of-travel of an edge between two adjacent photoreceptors and a high signal is sampled in the null direction.</p><p>We were unable to measure the At,,, limit for the optical input stimulus, because it is so large that it exceeds the capabilities of our experimental apparatus. The data for the electronic input shows that the motion-computing stage has low intrinsic noise and a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude, and that At,,, is ultimately limited by leakage currents, rather than by noise. The optical input stage, however, reduces the dynamic range of the sensor, because of the significantly higher noise from the photoreceptor and edge-detection circuitry and because of the larger width of the sampling pulse, causing spurious responses in the null direction at high speeds. Yet we still obtain at least three orders of magnitude of dynamic range for high-contrast optical edges. As we have seen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>), more severe dynamic range limitations, especially at high velocities, arise from the nonuniformity of the input signals, as derived from edges with different sharpnesses and contrasts, under a variety of lighting conditions. if progress were made on a good adaptive algorithm for finding edges or other features, the dynamic range of analog VLSI motion sensors could be greatly improved, because the effective "noise" at the input would then be reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Scaling Considerations</head><p>An elementary cell of a 1-D array of FS sensors consists of an edge detector, a pulse-shaping circuit, two motion circuits, and a direction-selection circuit. it comprises 41 transistors and eight capacitors, totaling 7.5 pF capacitance. FS sensors have been fabricated using a 2 pm n-well CMOS process provided by the MOSIS prototyping service, where the total area consumption of an elementary cell is about 0.05 mm2. The smallest chips ("tiny" chips) available through the MOSIS service with a usable area of about 2.5 mm2 (leaving room for read-out circuitry and pads) can accommodate 50 pixels. The largest MOSIS chip would be able to contain 1250 pixeIs on 62.5 mm2.</p><p>For an arrangement of elementary motion cells operating in two dimensions, the edge detectors and the pulse-shaping circuits may be shared among all directions, but each cell would need four motion circuits and two direction- for motion in the preferred direction, shown as a function of image velocity for a 56% sharp edge. is compared to that measured for stimulation of the motion-computing circuitrj with 50 p s long current impulses to simulate the outputs of adjacent edge detectors to idealized edges. A theoretical fit to the latter data, based on ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), is also shown. The rms enor of the data points for optical input, as indicated by error bars, averages to about 3 mV, whereas for electronic stimulation each data point has an rms error of less than 1 mV. The FS motion sensor shows excellent performance over more than seven orders of magnitude of velocity for such standardized electronic input signals due to its adaptive time constant and low intrinsic noise. For optical stimulation, our measured data is limited to three orders of magnitude for the following reasons: 1) at high speeds, the finite width of the sampling pulse causes spurious responses in the null direction. 2) at high speeds, our rotating test drum runs unevenly and wobbles, and 3) we are unahie to run the test drum at very low speeds.</p><p>selection circuits. This would increase the cell size by about 35%.</p><p>If the circuits were fabricated in a state-of-the-art 0.7 pm process, the cells could probably be reduced to about a quarter of their current size, so that a 128 x 128 array would fit onto 16 mm x 16 mm chip area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. SYSTEM APPLICATIONS</head><p>As discussed in the previous sections, we designed analog VLSI motion sensors whose outputs are nearly independent of absolute light level and stimulus contrast, if these are sufficiently high, and that are able to achieve satisfactory performance over a large dynamic range in velocity. Because they integrate both the photosensing as well as the motion-computation stage on a single chip, they represent a small, power-lean, and low-cost alternative to conventional computer-vision systems.</p><p>Two significant problems need to be tackled next. First, so far we have made no attempt to integrate the optical flow over space. In particular, we have not designed any circuitry to solve the aperture problem at the level of our motion sensors. Second, such sensors lack a high degree of precision in their output values because of temporal noise (see Section 11), spatial fixed-pattem noise in motion sensing arrays due to offsets and because the performance of the FS sensor degrades at low contrasts and irradiance levels. The rms voltage noise of an FS velocity-sensing element averages to about 3 mV over the velocity range shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, that spans three orders of magnitude and maps onto a voltage range of 0.6 V. This corresponds to 7 or 8 b of resolution for such a stimulus.</p><p>To fully exploit our motion sensors at a system level, we need to develop parallel image-processing architectures for applications that rely mainly on qualitative properties of the optical flow, rather than on the precise value of each flow vector. Given the noise inherent in cortical neurons, it might be argued that optical flow computations carried out in the central nervous system can also only exploit such properties. Furthermore, analog VLSI devices are most efficient at solving well-defined custom problems, unlike their digital counterparts that are programmable and therefore more versatile. Thus we need to choose application domains where analog VLSI solutions are attractive compared to standard, digital machine vision systems. As an example, we will focus on an application domain that is becoming important in both research and industrial communities-vehicle navigation. Specifically, we will show how parallel architectures based on analog VLSI motion sensors can be used to estimate integrative features of optical flow fields extracted from typical vehicle navigation scenes <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The two features that we shall discuss are heading direction and time-to-contact. Among other features that can be estimated are motion discontinuities, to help segregate objects (e.g., cars) from the background [37]-[ 391.</p><p>In order to analyze the computational properties of the optical flow and to determine the most suitable architectures for analog VLSI implementations, we performed software simulations on sequences of images obtained from a commercially available camera a 64 x 64 pixel silicon retina placed on a moving van. The camera uses adaptive CMOS photoreceptors similar in overall design to the ones incorporated into our motion sensors. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows an example of such an image and the associated optical flow field.</p><p>In our simulations, the optical flow fields were generated by implementing a gradient algorithm based on the imagebrightness-constancy equation (see Section 111-B for the 1- D formulation). If E ( J , y. t ) represents the image irradiance at time t and position ( r , y ) , the brightness-constancy equation expresses the constraint that d &amp;E(X,Y,t) = 0 in subregions of the image. By explicitly computing the temporal and spatial derivatives, (21) can be rewritten as a at U E . V + -E 0 and the velocity vector v can be computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">3 at = -(wt.

F E ) exceeds a certain threshold <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[SI,</ref><ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>. At locations where it remains below the threshold, the optical flow is not estimated. Thus the data is sparse and only reliable for areas in the image with high contrast. Having defined the types of images to be analyzed and the types of processing to be performed, we can use a priori information to selectively integrate such sparse data to estimate the targeted features of the optical flow field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Heading Direction</head><p>We are primarily interested in measuring the heading direction of a vehicle along the horizontal axis, since this is the axis along which the vehicle may be controlled. Hence, we will consider arrays of 1-D velocity sensors to reduce the computational complexity of the problem. A further simplification can be made if we restrict the task to purely translational ego motion. Because cars and other vehicles will soon contain integrated sensors for determining the rate of rotation around the three body axes, we assume here that we can use this extra-retinal information to remove the components of the optical flow due to rotation.</p><p>In the case of pure translational motion, the heading direction coincides with the focus-ofexpansion (FOE) and is defined as the spatial location on the image plane from which all the velocity vectors diverge. If we only examine the horizontal component of the optical flow, the FOE corresponds to the point at which the vectors change direction. If we assign positive values to those pointing in one direction and negative values to vectors pointing in the opposite direction, the FOE location will correspond to the point closest to the zero crossing in the array. Unfortunately, even when there is no rotational motion involved, real image sequences may give rise to optical flow fields that contain more than one zero-crossing. Nevertheless, by using a priori information on the spatial The outputs of an array of FS sensors corresponding to opposite directions of motion are fed into differencing transconductance amplifiers. The positive and negative half currents of the amplifiers are spatially smoothed with separate diffusor networks. The outputs of the diffusor networks provide the input to a correlation network that detects the adjacency of large currents corresponding to opposite directions of a motion. The correlation network signals the presence and strength of zero-crossing in the optical flow field. A winner-takes-all network with positive feedback and lateral spreading selects the FOE that corresponds to the steepest zero-crossing, and that is near the previously selected FOE.</p><p>and temporal characteristics of the optical flow image (e.g., by making the assumption that the direction of heading of a vehicle changes smoothly), it is possible to detect the correct position of the FOE.</p><p>An analog VLSI architecture designed to extract the FOE from a 1-D image is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> [38], [401. The two directional outputs of an array of FS motion sensors are differenced with transconductance amplifiers [41]. The positive and negative half currents from the amplifiers are separately smoothed with diffusor networks [42] to reduce noise and offsets from the sensor data. An abrupt change in the direction of the optical flow vectors is reported by bump-like correlator circuits <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>. These circuits detect the adjacency of large opponent currents (positive half current versus negative half current) belonging to neighboring pixels, i.e., they perform zero-crossing detection, and yield information on the slope of the zero-crossing as well. A winner-take-all network with distributed excitation <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref> chooses the position of the steepest zero-crossing as the location of the FOE. The winner-take-all network has builtin lateral spreading and positive feedback such that the position of the FOE that is chosen is always near that of the previous choice; consequently, the position of the FOE shifts smoothly in time as one would expect from a realworld situation. The scanners report the spatial response of the winner-take-all network outputs off chip, so that the position of the FOE may be shown on a display. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> shows an example of the FOE computation for the data of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> obtained from software simulations that model the aschitecture shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>.</p></div>

Using the 2-D version of Gauss's divergence theorem, it has been shown [46] that r can be estimated in a very robust manner for an arbitrary translatory motion toward a plane at distance 20 by measuring the normal velocity component around some closed contour. If we consider as closed contour a circle C of radius TO and assume a linear velocity field V so that V .

The pulse-shaping circuits and motion circuits are located in the central part of the chip and the direction-selection circuits are located on the lcrt and right sides. Their output currents are summed for each direction (outward and inward) and subtracted (using a current minor) to yield the final output that is inversely proportional to the timc-to-conract.

Furthermore, because we are integrating over the output of a number of elementary motion sensors, each individual measurement can be affected by a certain amount of noise without substantially deteriorating the overall result. In the more general case of an observer approaching a slanted surface (leading to a quadratic velocity field), as long as the observer is heading directly for this slanted surface, one can exploit the symmetry of the velocity field, arriving at the same result as above. Similar integration schemes can be exploited for designing circuits sensitive to rotations <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>. This type of computation therefore lends itself remarkably well to VLSI implementation.</p><p>We designed a parallel architecture in which 12 FS velocity sensors, arranged on a circle, estimate the radial component of the velocity field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref>). For such an arrangement, the time-to-contact can be approximated by where N denotes the number of velocity-measuring elements on the circle, T the radius of the circle, and v k the radial velocity components at the locations of the elements. The output voltages of the FS sensors are converted into currents that linearly encode velocity. The currents are summed together, so that the total output current is inversely proportional to the time-to-contact. The algorithm is robust in that errors due to device mismatch, noise, and erroneous velocity measurements are decreased through averaging. Using a stimulus of high-contrast concentric rings centered on the focus-of-expansion or just simulating an approaching motion with a rotating spiral we obtained reasonably accurate estimates of the time-to-contact <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>.</p><p>As yet, we have not accounted for the aperture problem, i.e., we are not able to extract the radial velocity component of a randomly oriented edge, but due to the integrative properties of the sensor we expect to be able to find reasonable estimates for the time-to-contact in more general scenes and to reliably determine the direction of motion (i.e., expansion or contraction) in them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have shown in this article how analog VLSI velocity sensors with on-chip photoreceptors can be built and how they can be used in massively parallel architectures to evaluate integrative features of the optical flow. Given the robust, very compact, and low-power nature of such smart vision sensors, they represent a true alternative-for certain applications-to more conventional digital image architectures 111.</p><p>More specifically, we have emphasized the following points: photoreceptor sizing is important because of the tradeoffs between spatial filtering and the reduction of noise. The limits of operation of motion sensors are determined by the maximum and minimum values of parameters in the system andor by noise. One can carry out quantitative calculations of the dynamic range of motion sensors as a function of the SNR of the system. These calculations show why it is advantageous to use nonlinear adaptive filters such as those built with a diode and a capacitor to obtain a wide dynamic range, as evidenced by the data from our FS sensor. The determination of features like focus-ofexpansion and time-to-contact that can be estimated from integrative properties of the optical flow are promising targets for parallel analog VLSI implementations. This is because such features are particularly important for mobile systems, where processing time, size, and power consumption are often important issues that favor analog VLSI implementations over traditional digital ones.

The noise war calculated from measurements of the power of the first seven harmonics of 120 Hz (I-7f). Neutral-density filters were interposed between the light source and the photoreceptors to attenuate the irradiance level in a conlrolled manner. The noise at high irradiance levels is identical for the tm-o photoreceptors with light-collecting areas of 40 p m x 40 p m and 20 p m x 20 pm, respectively. since the signal gain of the photoreceptor is invariant with its light-collection area. However. because of its lower bandwidth (due to the parasitic capacitance on the photodiode sensing node). the smaller photoreceptor starts to filter out the noise at higher light levels.

(a) Comparison of the calculated impulse responses of a parallel RC circuit as implemented by the low-pass filter of the Reichardt sensor (see Fig.4) and a nonlinear adaptive filter built with an exponential element and a capacitor in parallel. The response of the nonlinear filter has a much steeper slope initially and thus a higher sensitivity than that of the RC filter; subsequently, its time constant increases so that its decay becomes eventually much slower than that of the RC filter. The use of such a nonlinear filter in a motion sensor results in a much larger dynamic range than the use of a RC filter, since the sharp slope near the origin reduces At,,;,, while the slow decay after long delays increases</figDesc></figure>

Temporal-edge detectors (E) generate current impulses in response to fast image irradiance (i.e., brightness) transients. Pulse-shaping circuits (P) convert the current impulses into voltage pulses. Voltage pulses from adjacent pixels are fed into two motion circuits (M) computing velocity for opposite directions (x and I;) along one dimension. A direction-selection circuit (D) suppresses the response in the null direction to prevent temporal aliasing. (b) lhltage signuls. The analog output voltage of the motion circuit for rightward motion ( Vr) equals the voltage of the slowly decaying facilitation pulse (\(sl) at the time of arrival of the narrow and fast sampling pulse (Viz). For leftward motion, the fast sampling pulse precedes the slow facilitation pulse and the output voltage is low. The analog output voltage thus encodes velocity for rightward motion only.</figDesc></figure>
