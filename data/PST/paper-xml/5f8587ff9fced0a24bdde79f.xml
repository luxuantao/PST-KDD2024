<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A great number of deep learning based models have been recently proposed for automatic music composition. Among these models, the Transformer stands out as a prominent approach for generating expressive classical piano performance with a coherent structure of up to one minute. The model is powerful in that it learns abstractions of data on its own, without much human-imposed domain knowledge or constraints. In contrast with this general approach, this paper shows that Transformers can do even better for music modeling, when we improve the way a musical score is converted into the data fed to a Transformer model. In particular, we seek to impose a metrical structure in the input data, so that Transformers can be more easily aware of the beat-bar-phrase hierarchical structure in music. The new data representation maintains the flexibility of local tempo changes, and provides hurdles to control the rhythmic and harmonic structure of music. With this approach, we build a Pop Music Transformer that composes Pop piano music with better rhythmic structure than existing Transformer models.</p></div>

For example, the organization of musical notes of different fundamental frequencies (from low to high) influences the melody, harmony and texture of music. The placement of strong and weak beats over time, on the other hand, gives rise to the perception of rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

In the brackets, we show the ranges of the type of event.</p><p>Repetition and long-term structure are also important factors that make a musical piece coherent and understandable. Building machines that can compose music like human beings is one of the most exciting tasks in multimedia and artificial intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>. Among the approaches that have been studied, neural sequence models, which consider music as a language, stand out in recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> as a prominent approach with great potential. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> In doing so, a digital representation of a musical score is converted into a time-ordered sequence of discrete tokens such as the Note-On events. Sequence models such as the Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> can then be applied to model the probability distribution of the event sequences, and to sample from the distribution to generate new music compositions. This approach has been shown to work well for composing minute-long pieces of classical piano music with expressive variations in note density and velocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, in the format of a MIDI file. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>We note that there are two critical elements in the aforementioned approach-the way music is converted into discrete tokens for language modeling, and the machine learning algorithm used to build the model. Recent years have witnessed great progress regarding the second element, for example, by improving the self-attention in Transformers with "sparse attention" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, or introducing a recurrence mechanism as in Transformer-XL for learning longer-range dependency <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. However, no much has been done for the first one. Most work simply follows the MIDI-like event representation proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> to set up the "vocabulary" for music.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, the MIDI-like representation, for the case of modeling classical piano music <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, uses Note-On events to indicate the action of hitting a specific key of the piano keyboard, and Note-Off for the release of the key. This representation has its roots in MIDI <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a communication protocol that also uses Note-On and Note-Off messages to transmit data of real-time musical performance. Unlike words in human language, note messages in MIDI are associated with time. To convert a score into a sequence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> uses additionally the Time-Shift (Δ𝑇 ) events to indicate the relative time gap between events (rather than the absolute time of the events), thereby representing the advance in time. This MIDIlike representation is general and represents keyboard-style music (such as piano music) fairly faithfully, therefore a good choice as the format for the input data fed to Transformers. A general idea here is that a deep network can learn abstractions of the MIDI data that contribute to the generative musical modeling on its own. Hence, high-level (semantic) information of music <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, such as downbeat, tempo and chord, are not included in this MIDI-like representation.</p><p>However, we note that when humans compose music, we tend to organize regularly recurring patterns and accents over a metrical structure defined in terms of sub-beats, beats, and bars <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Such a structure is made clear on a score sheet or a MIDI file with notation of the time signature and bar lines, but is implicit in the MIDI-like event representation. A sequence model has to recover the metrical structure on its own from the provided sequence of tokens. When it comes to modeling music genres that feature the use of steady beats, we observe that the Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> has a hard time learning the regularity of beats over time, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. To remedy this, and to study whether Transformer-based composition models can benefit from the addition of some human knowledge of music, we propose REMI, which stands for revamped MIDIderived events, to represent MIDI data following the way humans read them. Specifically, we introduce the Bar event to indicate the beginning of a bar, and the Position events to point to certain locations within a bar. For example, Position (9/16) indicates that we are pointing to the middle of a bar, which is quantized to 16 regions in this implementation (see Section 3 for details). The combination of Position and Bar therefore provides an explicit metrical grid to model music, in a beat-based manner. This new data representation informs models the presence of a beat-bar hierarchical structure in music and empirically leads to better rhythmic regularity in the case of modeling Pop music, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>.</p><p>We note that, while the incorporation of the bars is not new in the literature of automatic music composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>, it represents a brand new attempt in the context of Transformer-based music modeling. This facilitates extensions of the Transformer, such as the Compressive Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, Insertion Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, and Tree Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, to be studied for this task in the future, since the models have now clearer ideas of segment boundaries in music.</p><p>Moreover, we further explore adding other supportive musical tokens capturing higher-level information of music. Specifically, to model the expressive rhythmic freedom in music (e.g., tempo rubato), we add a set of Tempo events to allow for local tempo changes per beat. To have control over the chord progression underlying the music being composed, we introduce the Chord events to make the harmonic structure of music explicit, in the same vein of adding the Position and Bar events for rhythmic structure.</p><p>In achieving all these, the proposed framework for automatic music composition has to integrate audio-and symbolic-domain music information retrieval (MIR) techniques such as downbeat tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> and chord recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>, which differentiates it from existing approaches. Moreover, we use automatic music transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> to prepare the MIDI data, so the model learns from expressive piano performances. We show in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> an illustration of the overall framework.   with the commonly-adopted MIDI-like representation, and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> gives an example of a REMI event sequence.</p><p>In our experiment (see Section 5), we use Transformer-XL <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to learn to compose Pop piano music using REMI as the underlying data representation. We conduct both objective and subjective evaluation comparing the proposed model against the Music Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, showing that we are able to improve the state-of-the-art with simple yet major modifications in the data presentation, rather than with sophisticated re-design of the neural network architecture.</p><p>For reproducibility, the code, data and pre-trained model are made publicly available. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Recent neural network-based approaches for automatic music composition can be broadly categorized into two groups. Image-based approaches such as MidiNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> and MuseGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> use an imagelike representation such as the piano roll to represent a score as a matrix of time steps and MIDI pitches, and then use convolutionbased operations to generate music. It is easier for such approaches to learn the rhythmic structure of music, as the time steps corresponding to the beats and bar lines are clear in such matrices. Language-based approaches such as the Music Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, on the other hand, may learn the temporal dependency between musical events such as Note-Ons better. Yet, due to the limits of the MIDI-like representation outlined in Section 1, existing work may fall short in the rhythmic aspect. The proposed approach combines the advantage of the image-and language-based approaches by embedding a metrical grid in the event representation.</p><p>The idea of designing events for music metadata is similar to CTRL <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which provided more explicit controls for text generation. However, recent work in neural sequence modeling of music mostly adopt the same MIDI-like event representation proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, or its extensions. For example, extra events denoting the composer, instrumentation and global tempo are used in MuseNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> for conditioned generation, and events specifying the Note-On and Note-Off of different instruments are used to achieve multi-instrument music composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, to our best knowledge, the use of Time-Shift to mark the advance in time has</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">NEW EVENT-BASED REPRESENTATION OF MUSIC</head><p>In this section, we discuss at length how 'REMI' is different from the commonly-adopted 'MIDI-like' representation (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), and how we design the proposed events. As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, a score to be converted into events can be either a MIDI score with no expressive dynamics and timing, or a MIDI performance that has been converted from an expressive audio recording by means of, for example, a MIDI keyboard, or automatic music transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We consider the latter case in this paper, but the discussion below can also be generalized to the former case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Note-On and Note Velocity</head><p>The collection of 128 Note-On events indicates the onset of MIDI pitches from 0 (C-1) to 127 (G9), and Note Velocity indicates the level of dynamics (which correspond to perceptual loudness) of the note event. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> Both the MIDI-like and REMI representations have these two types of events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Note-Off versus Note Duration</head><p>In REMI, we use Note Duration events in replacement of the Note-Off events. Specifically, we represent each note in a given score with the following three consecutive tokens: a Note Velocity event, a Note-On event, and a Note Duration event. There are advantages in doing so:</p><p>• In MIDI-like, the duration of a note has to be inferred from the time gap between a Note-On and the corresponding Note-Off, by accumulating the time span of the Time Shift events in between. In REMI, note duration is made explicit, facilitating modeling the rhythm of music. • In MIDI-like, a Note-On event and the corresponding Note-Off are usually several events apart. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> As a result, a sequence model may find it difficult to learn that Note-On and Note-Off must appear in pairs, generating dangling Note-On events without the corresponding Note-Off. We would then have to use some heuristics (e.g., maximal note duration) to turn off a note in post-processing. With REMI, we are free of such an issue, because the sequence model can easily learn from the training data that a Note Velocity event has to be followed by a Note-On event, and then right away a Note Duration event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Time-Shift versus Position &amp; Bar</head><p>Empirically, we find that it is not easy for a model to generate music with steady beats using the Time-Shift events. When listening to the music generated, the intended bar lines drift over time and the rhythm feels unstable. We attribute this to the absence of a metrical structure in the MIDI-like representation. Mistakes in Time-Shift would lead to accumulative error of timing in the inference phase, which is not obvious in the training phase due to the common use of teacher forcing strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> in training recurrent models.</p><p>To address this issue, we propose to use the combination of Bar and Position events instead. Both of them are readily available from the musical scores, or from the result of automatic music transcription (with the help of a beat and downbeat tracker <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>); they are simply discarded in the MIDI-like representation. While Bar marks the bar lines, Position points to one of the 𝑄 possible discrete locations in a bar. Here 𝑄 is an integer that denotes the time resolution adopted to represent a bar. For example, if we consider a 16-th note time grid as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>, 𝑄 = 16. Adding Bar and Position therefore provides a metrical context for models to "count the beats" and to compose music bar-after-bar. 67  We note that there are extra benefits in using Position &amp; Bar, including 1) we can more easily learn the dependency (e.g., repetition) of note events occurring at the same Position (★/𝑄) across bars; 2) we can add bar-level conditions to condition the generation process if we want; 3) we have time reference to coordinate the generation of different tracks for the case of multi-instrument music.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Tempo</head><p>In an expressive musical performance, the temporal length (in seconds) of each bar may not be the same. To account for such local changes in tempo (i.e., beats per minute; BPM), we add Tempo events every beat (i.e., at Position (1/𝑄), Position ( 𝑄 4 + 1 /𝑄), etc). In this way, we have a flexible time grid for expressive rhythm. 8 Unlike the Position events, information regrading the Tempo events may not be always available in a MIDI score. But, for the case of MIDI performances, one can derive such Tempo events with the use of an audio-domain tempo estimation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Chord</head><p>As another set of supportive musical tokens, we propose to encode the chord information into input events. Specifically, chords are defined as any harmonic set of pitches consisting of multiple notes sounding together or one after another. A chord consists of a root note and a chord quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Here, we consider 12 chord roots (C,C#,D,D#,E,F,F#,G,G#,A,A#,B) and five chord qualities (major, minor, diminished, augmented, dominant), yielding 60 possible Chord events, covering the triad and seventh chords. However, the set of Chord events can be further expanded as long as there is a way to get these chords from a MIDI score or a MIDI performance in the data preparation process. We note that the Chord events are just "symbols"-the notes are still generated with the Note-on events after them.</p><p>Following the time grid of REMI, each Tempo or Chord event is preceded by a Position event. 6 We find in our implementation that models learn the meaning of Bar and Position quickly-right after a few epochs the model knows that, e.g., Position (9/𝑄) cannot go before Position (3/𝑄), unless there is a Bar in between. No postprocessing is needed to correct errors. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> for the learning curve seen in our implementation. 7 We note that the idea of using Bar and Position has been independently proposed before <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, though in the context of RNN-based not Transformer-based models. 8 As exemplified in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we use a combination of Tempo Class events (low, mid, high) and Tempo Value events to represent local tempo values of 30-209 BPM.</p><p>We note that music composed by a model using the MIDI-like representation also exhibits the use of chords, as such note combinations can be found in the training data by the sequence model itself. However, by explicitly generating Tempo and Chord events, tempo and chord become controllable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PROPOSED FRAMEWORK</head><p>Again, a diagram of the proposed beat-based music modeling and generation framework can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We provide details of some of the major components below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Backbone Sequence Model</head><p>The Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> is a neural sequence model that uses selfattention to bias its prediction of the current token based on a subset of the past tokens. This design has been shown effective for modeling the structure of music. For example, with the help of a relative-positional encoding method <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>, Music Transformer is claimed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to be able to compose expressive classical piano music with a coherent structure of up to one minute.</p><p>Transformer-XL <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> extends Transformer by introducing the notion of recurrence and revising the positional encoding scheme. The recurrence mechanism enables the model to leverage the information of past tokens beyond the current training segment, thereby looking further into the history. Theoretically, Transformer-XL can encode arbitrarily long context into a fixed-length representation. Therefore, we adopt Transformer-XL as our backbone model architecture. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">9</ref>In the training process, each input sequence is divided into "segments" of a specific length (set to 512 events in our implementation). Given such segments, the overall computational procedure for an 𝑁 -layer Transformer-XL with 𝑀 heads can be summarized as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h𝑛−1 𝜏 = [stop_gradient(h 𝑛−1 𝜏−1 ) • h 𝑛−1 𝜏 ] ,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">q 𝑛 𝜏 , k 𝑛 𝜏 , v 𝑛 𝜏 = h 𝑛−1 𝜏 W ⊤ 𝑞 , h𝑛−1 𝜏 W ⊤ 𝑘 , h𝑛−1 𝜏 W ⊤ 𝑣 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">a 𝑛 𝜏,𝑖 = masked_softmax(q 𝑛⊤ 𝜏,𝑖 k 𝑛 𝜏,𝑖 + R)v 𝑛 𝜏,𝑖 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">a 𝑛 𝜏 = [a 𝑛 𝜏,1 • a 𝑛 𝜏,2 • ... • a 𝑛 𝜏,𝑚 ] ⊤ W 𝑛 𝑜 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">o 𝑛 𝜏 = layernorm(a 𝑛 𝜏 + h 𝑛−1 𝜏 ) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">h 𝑛 𝜏 = max(0, o 𝑛 𝜏 W 𝑛 1 + b 𝑛 1 )W 𝑛 2 + b 𝑛 2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where h 𝑛 𝜏 denotes the 𝑛-th layer hidden features for the 𝜏-th segment, R denotes the relative positional encodings designed for the Transformer-XL <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, a 𝑛 𝜏,𝑖 indicates the attention features from the 𝑖-th head, and q, k, v denote the query, key and values in the computation of self-attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, respectively. The main difference between Transformer and Transformer-XL lies in the usage of the features from the segments prior to the current segment (i.e., the segments are from the same input MIDI sequence of a music piece) when updating the model parameters based on that current segment. This mechanism brings in longer temporal context and speeds up both the training and inference processes. Transformer-like sequence models learn the dependency among elements (i.e., events here) of a sequence. Therefore, although we have quite a diverse set of events featuring different characteristics in the proposed REMI representation, we opt for the simple approach of using a single Transformer-XL to model all these events at once. In other words, we do not consider the alternative, possibly more computationally intensive, approach of establishing multiple Transformer models, one for a non-overlapping subset of the events, followed by some mechanisms to communicate between them.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Beat Tracking and Downbeat Tracking</head><p>To create the Bar events, we employ the recurrent neural network model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to estimate from the audio files the position of the 'downbeats,' which correspond to the first beat in each bar. The same model is used to track the beat positions to create the Tempo events <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We obtain the tick positions between beats by linear interpolation, and then align the note onsets and offsets to the nearest tick. To eliminate the imprecision of transcription result, we further quantize the onset and offset times according to the assumed time grid (e.g., to the 16-th note when 𝑄 = 16).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Chord Recognition</head><p>We establish the 60 Chord events described in Section 3.5 by designing a heuristic rule-based symbolic-domain chord recognition algorithm to the transcribed MIDI files. First, we compute binaryvalued "chroma features" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for each tick, to represent the activity of 12 different pitch classes ignoring the pitch's octave. Then, we use a sliding window to assign "likelihood scores" to every active note for each 2-beat and 4-beat segment. After summarizing the chroma features of the current segment, we consider every note in a segment as a candidate root note of the Chord of that segment, and calculate its pitch intervals to all the other notes in that segment. The look-up table shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> is employed to assign likelihood scores to a pair of root note and chord quality based on the pitch intervals. Each chord quality has its required set of pitch intervals, and scoring functions. Finally, we recursively label the segments by the Chord symbol with the highest likelihood score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EVALUATION</head><p>We report both objective and subjective evaluations aiming to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model over the Music Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>  our model and variants of the the Music Transformer, then some implementation details, and finally the performance study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Dataset</head><p>We intend to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for Pop piano composition, as Pop is a musical genre that features salient rhythmic structures. In doing so, we collect audio files of Pop piano music from the Internet. A total number of 775 pieces of piano music played by different people is collected, amounting to approximately 48 hours' worth of data. They are covers <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">10</ref> of various Japanese anime, Korean popular and Western popular songs, playing only with the piano. We then apply "Onsets and Frames" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the state-of-the-art approach for automatic piano transcription, to estimate the pitch, onset time, offset time and velocity of the musical notes of each song, converting the audio recordings into MIDI performances. We select the Pop piano covers such that they are all in 4/4 time signature, simplifying the modeling task. Accordingly, a bar is composed of four beats. Furthermore, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, we consider the 16-th note time grid and quantize each bar into 𝑄 = 16 intervals.</p><p>In our preliminary experiments, we have attempted to use a finer time grid (e.g., 32-th or 64-th note) to reduce quantization errors and to improve the expression of music (e.g., to include triplets, swing, mirco-timing variations, etc). However, we found that this seems to go beyond the capability of the adopted Transformer-XL architecture. The generated compositions using a finer time grid tends to be fragmented and not pleasant to listen to. This is an issue that has to be addressed in the future. We stick with 𝑄 = 16 hereafter.</p><p>Due to copyright restrictions, we plan to make the training data publicly available not as audio files but as the transcribed MIDI files and the converted REMI event sequences.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Baselines &amp; Model Settings</head><p>We consider three variants of the Music Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> as the baselines in our evaluation. The first one, dubbed Baseline 1, follows fairly faithfully the model settings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, except that we use Transformer-XL instead of Transformer (for fair comparison with our model). The other two differ from the first one only in the adopted event representation. While Baseline 1 employs exactly the MIDI-like representation, Baseline 2 replaces Note-Off by Note Duration, and Baseline 3 further modifies the time steps taken in Time-Shift from multiples of 10ms to multiples of the 16-th note. In this way, Baseline 3 has a time grid similar to that of REMI, making Baseline 3 a strong baseline.</p><p>For either the baselines or the proposed model adopting the REMI representation, we train a single Transformer-XL with 𝑁 = 12 selfattention layers and 𝑀 = 8 attention heads. The length of the training input events (i.e., the segment length) and the recurrence length (i.e., the length of the segment "cached" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) are both set to 512. The total number of learnable parameters is approximately 41M. Training a model with an NVIDIA V100 with mini-batch size of 16 till the training loss (i.e., cross-entropy) reaches a certain level takes about 9 hours. We find that Baseline 1 needs a smaller learning rate and hence longer training time. For processing the MIDI files, we use the miditoolkit. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">11</ref>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the training loss of different event types as the training unfolds. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref> shows that Baseline 1 struggles the most for learning Time-Shift. Moreover, Note-Off has higher loss than Note-On, suggesting that they are not recognized as event pairs. In contrast, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref> shows that the Position events in REMI are easy to learn, facilitating learning the rhythm of music. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">12</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Objective Evaluation</head><p>The objective evaluation assesses the rhythmic structure of the generated compositions. Specifically, we employ each model to randomly generate 1,000 sequences, each with 4,096 events, using the temperature-controlled stochastic sampling method with topk <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. We convert the generated sequences into MIDI and then render them into audio via a piano synthesizer. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">13</ref> Then, we apply the joint beat and downbeat tracking model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to the resulting audio clips. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">14</ref>The model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> has two components. The first one estimates the probability, or salience, of observing beats and downbeats for each time frame via a recurrent neural network (RNN). The second one applies a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to the output of the RNN to make binary decisions of the occurrence of beats and downbeats. We use the output of the RNN to calculate the downbeat salience, and the output of the DBN for the beat STD and downbeat STD. Specifically, given a piece of audio signal, the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> returns a time-ordered series of (𝜏 B 𝑡 , 𝑠 B 𝑡 ), where 𝜏 B 𝑡 denotes the estimate time (in seconds) for the 𝑡-th beat by the DBN, and 𝑠 B 𝑡 ∈ [0, 1] the salience associated with that beat estimated by the RNN. It also returns similarly a series of (𝜏 D 𝑡 , 𝑠 D 𝑡 ) for the downbeats; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for examples of such series. From the tracking results, we calculate the following values for each audio clip:</p><p>• Beat STD: the standard deviation of (𝜏 B 𝑡 − 𝜏 B 𝑡 −1 ), which is always positive, over the beat estimates for that clip.</p><p>• Downbeat STD: similarly the standard deviation of (𝜏 D 𝑡 − 𝜏 D 𝑡 −1 ) over the downbeat estimates for that clip. Both beat STD and downbeat STD assess the consistency of the rhythm. • Downbeat salience: the mean of 𝑠 D 𝑡 over the downbeat estimates for that clip, indicating the salience of the rhythm.</p><p>We report the average values across the audio clips, assuming that these values are closer to the values calculated from the training data (which have been quantized to the 16-th note grid) the better. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">15</ref>Tables <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the result of the baselines and a few variants (ablated versions) of the REMI-based model. From Beat STD and Downbeat STD, we see that the result of Baseline 1, which resembles Music Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, features fairly inconsistent rhythm, echoing the example shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The STD is lower when Note Duration is used in place of Note-Off, highlighting the effect of Note Duration in stabilizing the rhythm. Interestingly, we see that the REMI models without the Tempo events have much lower STD than the training data, suggesting that Tempo is important for expressive rhythmic freedom.</p><p>From downbeat salience, the REMI models outnumber all the baselines, suggesting the effectiveness of Position &amp; Bar. Moreover, the gap between the result of Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 further supports the use of the Note Duration events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Subjective Evaluation</head><p>The best way to evaluate a music composition model remains today to be via a listening test. To have a common ground to compare different models, we ask the models to continue the same given prompt. For doing so, we prepare an additional set of 100 Pop piano performances (that have no overlaps with the training set), process them according to the procedures described in Section 5.1, and take the first four bars from each of them as the prompts. The following three models are asked to generate 16 bars continuing each prompt, and got evaluated in an online listening test: 'Baseline 1, ' 'Baseline 3' and 'REMI without Chord. ' We do not use Chord here to make the rhythmic aspect the major point of difference among the models. We distribute the listening test over our social circles globally and solicit the response from 76 participants. 51 of them understand basic music theory and have the experience of being an amateur musician, so we consider them as professionals (denoted as 'pros'). A participant has to listen to two randomly picked sets of samples and evaluate, for each set, which sample they like the most and the least, in any evaluation criteria of their choice. Each set contains the result of the three models (in random order) for a given prompt.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows the aggregated scores, and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> the result of broken-down pairwise comparisons, along with the 𝑝-value of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We see that REMI is preferred by both pros and non-pros, and that the difference between REMI and Baseline 1 is significant (𝑝 &lt; 0.01).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> provides examples of the generated continuations. From the optional verbal feedbacks of the participants, the music generated by REMI are perceptually more pleasing and are more in line with the prompt. Audio examples can be found at our demo website. 16   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Controllable Chord and Tempo</head><p>Finally, we demonstrate the controllability of Tempo and Chord of our model. To achieve this, we can simply force the model not to generate specific events by masking out the corresponding probabilities of the model output. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows the piano rolls, (optionally) the Tempo and Chord events generated by our model under different conditions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref> shows that the model selects chords that are harmonically close to F:minor when we prohibit it from generating F:minor. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c</ref> shows controlling the Tempo Class affects not only the Tempo Value but also the note events. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have presented REMI, a novel MIDI-derived event representation for sequence model-based composition of expressive piano music. Using REMI as the underlying data representation, we have also built a Pop Music Transformer that outperforms that stateof-the-art Music Transformer for composing expressive Pop piano music, as validated in objective and subjective studies. We take this as a proof-of-concept that it is beneficial to embed prior human knowledge of music through including components of music information retrieval (MIR) techniques, such as downbeat estimation and chord recognition, to the overall generative framework. For future work, we plan to incorporate other high-level information of music, such as grooving <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and musical emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, to learn to compose additional tracks such as the guitar, bass, and drums, to further improve the resolution of the time grid, to condition the generative process with other multimedia input such as the lyrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> or a video clip <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, and also to study other model architectures that can model longer sequences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>) and thereby learn better the long-term structure in music.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Examples of piano rolls and 'downbeat probability curves' (cf.
