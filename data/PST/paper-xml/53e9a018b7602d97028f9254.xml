<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper investigates the tracking control of an electrically driven nonholonomic mobile robot with model uncertainties in the robot kinematics, the robot dynamics, and the wheel actuator dynamics. A robust adaptive controller is proposed with the utilization of adaptive control, backstepping and fuzzy logic techniques. The proposed control scheme employs the adaptive control approach to design an auxiliary wheel velocity controller to make the tracking error as small as possible in consideration of uncertainties in the kinematics of the robot, and makes use of the fuzzy logic systems to learn the behaviors of the unknown dynamics of the robot and the wheel actuators. The approximation errors and external disturbances can be efficiently counteracted by employing smooth robust compensators. A major advantage of the proposed method is that previous knowledge of the robot kinematics and the dynamics of the robot and wheel actuators is no longer necessary. This is because the controller learns both the robot kinematics and the robot and wheel actuator dynamics online. Most importantly, all signals in the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. For the dynamic uncertainties of robot and actuator, the assumption of "linearity in the unknown parameters" and tedious analysis of determining the "regression matrices" in the standard adaptive robust controllers are no longer necessary. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a simulation example.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>as time derivatives of some functions of the generalized coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In the literature, the control research for nonholonomic mobile robots has been centered around the stabilization and tracking problems. Due to the Brokett's condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, nonholonomic systems cannot be asymptotically stabilized to an equilibrium point by using continuous static state feedback controls. In accordance with the Brokett's condition, researchers have proposed controllers that utilize discontinuous control laws, smooth time-varying control laws or a hybrid form of the previous controllers to stabilize nonholonomic mobile robots (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and references therein).</p><p>In the tracking problem, the robot is to follow a reference trajectory. Using kinematic models of nonholonomic mobile robots, various approaches such as backstepping <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, pure pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, neural-fuzzy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, linearization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have been proposed to solve the tracking problem. However, the vehicle dynamics has been neglected. Moreover, a mobile robot is an uncertain multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear system, which suffers from the plant uncertainties and external disturbances. Recently, some approaches have been presented to integrate a kinematic controller and a torque controller for nonholonomic mobile robots with uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The adaptive control methods, which linearly parameterize the dynamic models of nonholonomic mobile robots, have been employed to solve the tracking problem of nonholonomic mobile robots with uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The developed approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> combined an adaptive kinematic controller in consideration of unknown parameters in the robot kinematics and an adaptive torque controller. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a robust adaptive controller combining a kinematic controller based on the chained form of the kinematic system and a robust torque controller has been proposed for the trajectory and force tracking problem of nonholonomic systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, a robust adaptive controller was presented for a class of nonholonomic mechanical systems with consideration of the actuator dynamics. One major problem of the adaptive control approaches is that certain functions must satisfy the assumption of "linearity in the parameters", and tedious analysis is required to determine "regression matrices". Furthermore, it is noted that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> external disturbances in the robot dynamics have been neglected, which may seriously degrade the performance of the tracking control. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Fierro and Lewis studied a control structure that integrated a kinematic controller and a feedforward neural network computed-torque controller for a nonholonomic mobile robot, and the neural network weights were tuned online, with no need of "offline learning phase". In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the kinematic and dynamic controllers were designed by using polar coordinates and wavelet networks, respectively, and the parameters and structure of wavelet networks were adapted online.</p><p>Another intensive area of research has been the adaptive control of uncertain nonlinear systems using fuzzy logic system (FLS). FLS with product inference, center-average defuzzifier, and Gaussian membership function is capable of approximating any real continuous functions on a compact set to arbitrary accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The FLS is constructed from a set of IF-THEN rules, and linguistic information from human experts can be incorporated into the FLS. Recently, many adaptive FLS controllers have been developed for various control applications and the closed-loop stability can be guaranteed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a control structure combining a kinematic controller and a dynamic controller based on nonlinear feedback control plus fuzzy compensator has been presented to solve the tracking and stabilization problems of the nonholonomic mobile robot, respectively. The fuzzy compensator, whose parameters were tuned online, was employed to approximate the total uncertainties including the structured and unstructured uncertainties due to the universal approximation property of FLS. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, a robust passivity-based controller using fuzzy logic has been proposed for the position control of nonholonomic mobile robots with plant uncertainties and external disturbances. The proposed controller guarantees that a system with nonholonomic constraints is stabilized to an -dimensional desired manifold. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a control scheme that integrated a kinematic controller and an adaptive fuzzy controller was developed for the trajectory tracking of nonholonomic mobile robots, where the wheel actuator dynamics was combined with the robot dynamics and the wheel actuator voltages were employed as control inputs.</p><p>However, most of the proposed controllers for the tracking control of nonholonomic mobile robots in the literature did not consider the uncertainties in the robot kinematics. Since measurements may be inaccurate and the wheels of the robot may be attrited; in practice, there are uncertainties in the robot kinematics. Moreover, the wheels of the robot are driven by actuators; therefore, the resulting electrically driven robot (the robot kinematics, robot dynamics and wheel actuator dynamics) is represented as a third-order system, and it is more realistic using actuator voltages as control inputs. Most of existing torque controllers neglecting wheel actuator dynamics may degrade the performance of the tracking control.</p><p>This paper addresses the tracking control problem of an electrically driven nonholonomic mobile robot with plant uncertainties and external disturbances. Both the robot kinematic uncertainties and the wheel actuator dynamics are taken into account. It is assumed that in the robot kinematics, there are parameter uncertainties, and in the dynamics of the robot and wheel actuators, there are parameter and non-parameter uncertainties. To solve this tracking problem, a robust adaptive controller is developed by use of the adaptive control technique, backstepping and FLS. The major features of the proposed approach are as follows.</p><p>1) The uncertainties in the kinematic model of the robot are taken into account, which have been neglected in most of existing methods for the tracking control of nonholonomic mobile robots.</p><p>2) The wheel actuator input voltages are chosen as the control inputs, which is more realistic than most of existing torque controllers where wheel torques are chosen as the control inputs. 3) Using the adaptive control technique, in cooperation with backstepping and FLSs, all exact values of the parameters of the robot and wheel actuators are not required to be known a priori. 4) Smooth robust compensators are employed to counteract the approximation errors and external disturbances. Previous knowledge of the robot kinematics and the dynamics of the robot and wheel actuators is not necessary because the developed controller learns both the robot kinematics and the robot and wheel actuator dynamics online. The proposed control scheme can ensure that all signals in the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Compared with standard adaptive robust controllers, lengthy and tedious analysis of determining "regression matrices" is no longer required.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Some basics of system stability, FLS, and nonholonomic systems are described in Section II. Section III discusses the robust adaptive controller design by use of the adaptive control technique, backstepping, and FLS for the tracking control problem of nonholonomic mobile robots. Lyapunov approach will be applied to show that all signals in the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results are presented in Section IV, and conclusions are given in Section V.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Description of FLS</head><p>An FLS is composed of four principal components: fuzzifier, fuzzy rule base, inference engine, and defuzzifier as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The fuzzifier maps the observed crisp input space to the fuzzy sets defined in and the defuzzifier performs an opposite assignment to map fuzzy sets to the crisp output space . The fuzzy inference engine determines a mapping from fuzzy sets in input space to fuzzy sets in output space based on fuzzy rules from fuzzy rule base. The fuzzy rule base consists of a set of linguistic rules in the form of "IF-THEN". In this paper, the fuzzy rule base consists of rules in the following forms:  where , and are the input and output vectors of the FLS, respectively; , , and , , are linguistic terms characterized by their membership functions and , respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ROBUST ADAPTIVE CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR THE NONHOLONOMIC MOBILE ROBOT USING BACKSTEPPING AND FUZZY APPROACH</head><p>Since the 1990's, backstepping <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> has become one of the most popular design methods for a large class of nonlinear systems. Backstepping design procedure is systematic and simple since it breaks down complex nonlinear systems into smaller subsystems, and designs partial Lyapunov functions and auxiliary controllers for these subsystems, and integrates these individual controllers into the actual controller by "back stepping" through the system and reassembling it from its component subsystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In this section, a robust adaptive controller is proposed for the tracking control of an electrically driven nonholonomic mobile robot with the aid of adaptive control technique, backstepping and FLS. First, an auxiliary controller for is designed with the aim to make the error as small as possible in consideration of the uncertainties in the kinematics of the nonholonomic mobile robot. Second, an auxiliary controller for is designed to make the difference between the auxiliary signal and the actual signal as small as possible. Third, the actuator voltage controller is designed to make the error as small as possible. The FLSs are introduced in the auxiliary controller and the actuator voltage controller to learn the behaviors of the unknown dynamics of the robot and actuators, and the external disturbances and approximation errors can be efficiently counteracted by employing smooth robust compensators. Finally, the overall closed-loop stability and performance of the online parameter-tuning algorithms are provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Step 1-Design of the Auxiliary Controller for</head><p>Various approaches have been proposed for solving the tracking problem of nonholonomic mobile robots using the kinematic models of the robots. However, little work in the literature has taken the uncertainties in the robot kinematics into account. Since measurements may be inaccurate and the wheels of the robot may be attrited, there are uncertainties in the kinematic model of the robot. As an efficient technique for nonlinear control design, feedback linearization has been applied to the tracking control of mobile robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, mobile robot systems are not input-state linearizable due to their nonholonomic constraints; however, they are input-output linearizable by selecting appropriate arguments as the robot outputs. In this subsection, an auxiliary controller based on the input-output linearization and adaptive control technique for is designed to make the output error as small as possible with consideration of the kinematic uncertainties.</p><p>Differentiating the robot output defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> The auxiliary controller for is chosen as <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> with a positive definite constant matrix.

Substituting the auxiliary wheel angular velocity controller (30) into ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> where .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Step 2-Design of the Auxiliary Controller for</head><p>Recall the robot dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> (32)</p><p>The auxiliary controller for is chosen as <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> where is a positive definite constant matrix, and is an estimation of that is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> Since there is a coupling term in the error dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, the term in the nonlinear function given by ( <ref type="formula">34</ref>) is adopted to compensate the coupling caused by . The function contains the parameters of the robot such as the masses, moments of inertia, friction coefficients, and so on. These quantities are often imperfectly known and difficult to determine. Therefore, the FLS is employed to learn the unknown function due to its universal approximation property.</p><p>The universal approximation capability of the FLS states that the unknown nonlinear function can be approximated over a compact set by an FLS and a reconstruction error as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> and whose estimate is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> In the adaptive control approaches, the unknown functions in the plant dynamics are assumed to be "linear in the unknown parameters". Therefore, lengthy and tedious preliminary analysis to determine "regression matrices" is required. Moreover, the adaptive control approaches do not solve the problem of unstructured uncertainties. In this work, the FLSs are introduced to approximate the unknown functions in the plant dynamics. An immediate advantage of the use of FLS is that the assumption of "linearity in the unknown parameters" and tedious analysis of determining "regression matrices" are no longer required.</p><p>Substituting the auxiliary torque controller (33) into the robot dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> where , , and denotes the disturbance term including the approximation error and external disturbances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Step 3-Design of the Actuator Voltage Controller</head><p>After the auxiliary torque controller is designed, the actuator voltage controller chosen as <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> where is a positive definite constant matrix, and is an estimation of that is defined by (39</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>Since there is a coupling term in the error dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, the term in the nonlinear function defined by ( <ref type="formula">39</ref>) is adopted to compensate the coupling caused by . The function contains the actuator motor parameters including electrical inductances, electrical resistances, and so on. Since the accurate values of these parameters are difficult to acquire, the FLS is adopted to approximate the unknown function .</p><p>The unknown nonlinear function can be approximated over a compact set by an FLS as follows: </p><p>The stability analysis of the closed-loop system and the parameter-tuning laws will be discussed next. Assumption 3: The optimal weight matrices of the FLSs are bounded so that (53) Theorem 1: Consider the electrically driven nonholonomic system described by ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">23</ref>), and suppose Assumptions 1-3 are satisfied. The control laws are provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> </p><p>All signals in the closed system are UUB. Proof of this theorem is given in the Appendix. Remarks: 1) In this paper, the fuzzy basis functions are used for , , 2. Also, several neural network basis functions can be used for , such as radial basis function <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and sigmoid function <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Gaussian functions are good at characterizing local properties, whereas sigmoid functions are good at capturing global properties. However, the fuzzy basis functions combine the advantages of both Gaussian and sigmoid functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, at the same time, which have the capability of combining numerical data and linguistic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>2) It is should be emphasized that the suggested controller design procedure was motivated by the so-called backstepping control <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In backstepping design procedures, it is crucial to determine regression matrices; therefore, lengthy and tedious preliminary analysis is required. The role of FLSs used in the proposed controller is to approximate the two complicated nonlinear uncertain functions and defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> and (39), respectively. An immediate advantage of the FLS design is that tedious analysis of determining "regression matrices" is not required, and the developed control structure can be applied to the tracking control of different nonholonomic mobile robots within the same class.</p><p>3) Similar to other adaptive FLS control methods, the proposed control scheme does not ensure that will converge to the true , , 2. However, the boundedness of , , 2, can be guaranteed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMULATION STUDIES</head><p>In this section, a simulation example will be provided to show the effectiveness of the developed methods. The adaptive fuzzy control scheme is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. The reference linear and velocities are 1 m/s, 1 rad/s.

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows the robot trajectories by using the proposed method. Though all exact values of the parameters of the robot and wheel actuators are not known a priori and there are external disturbances in the robot dynamics and wheel actuator dynamics, through the FLS learning phase, the tracking error converges to a quite small compact set after 3 s, which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> shows the simulation results using only PD control for the auxiliary torque controller and actuator voltage controller. The control gains are chosen as the same as those of the adaptive fuzzy controller. It can be seen that the performance is not good. Though the tracking errors can be reduced by increasing the control gains, it is well known that high-gain feedback may be highly undesirable since it may excite some high-frequency unmodeled dynamics. However, the control performance can be improved by using the proposed adaptive fuzzy control scheme with no need of high-gain feedback. In addition, these two highly complicated nonlinear functions and defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> and (39) are not required to be known in the proposed controller.</p><p>The responses of and are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. It is shown that and are bounded and approach to their actual values and , respectively. The bounded torque and actuator voltage by using the proposed controller are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>, respectively. These results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.  To illustrate the performance of the controller with regard to the system random disturbances, a 10-kg load disturbance is added at 4 s, and a load with random mass in the interval [0, 5] is applied after 8 s. The results using the proposed method are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> shows the tracking errors using the PD control with random noises. It can be seen that the performance of the proposed control is much better than that of the PD control. These results indicate that the proposed adaptive fuzzy controller is robust to both external disturbances and uncertainties and random disturbances on the system parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The tracking control of a mobile robot is not a simple task. First, the model is a system subjected to nonholonomic constraints. Second, a mobile robot is an uncertain MIMO system since the values of parameters of the robot and wheel actuators are very difficult to determine accurately; however, most of existing tracking controllers have not taken the kinematic uncertainties into account. Third, since the wheels of the robot   are driven by the actuator motors, the resulting electrically driven robot (the robot kinematics, robot dynamics and actuator dynamics) is represented as a third-order dynamic system.   Most of existing torque controllers designed with respect to the second-order, i.e., the wheel actuator dynamics has been neglected, might degrade the performance of the tracking control. To address these problems, a robust controller is proposed for adaptive control of an electrically driven nonholonomic mobile robot using adaptive control technique, backstepping, and FLS. The uncertainties in the robot kinematics have been considered and the wheel actuator voltages are chosen as the control inputs. The FLSs are introduced to learn the behaviors of the unknown dynamics of the robot and wheel actuators due to their universal approximation properties, and the external disturbances and approximation errors can be efficiently counteracted by employing smooth robust compensators. It is shown that all signals in the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error can be kept smaller by choosing appropriate controller parameters. The proposed approach does not require the exact values of the parameters of the robot and wheel actuators. Compared with the standard adaptive robust controllers, the assumption of "linearity in the unknown parameters" and tedious analysis of determining "regression matrices" are no longer required and the developed control structure can be applied to the tracking control of different mobile robots within the same class. Simulations are provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. It is noted that the tracking control problem of industrial manipulators with uncertain kinematics, dynamics, and actuator dynamics can also be solved by using the similar idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
