<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>During the last two decades since the publication of the survey paper in the IEEE Transactions of Automatic Control in 1977 [l], significant interest on Variable Structure Systems (VSS) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) have been generated in the control research community worldwide.</p><p>One of the most intriguing aspects of sliding mode is the discontinuous nature of the control action whose primary function is to switch between two distinctively different system structures (or components) such that a new type of system motion, called Sliding Mode, exists in a manifold. This peculiar system characteristic is claimed to re- sult in superb system performance which includes insensitivity to parameter variations, and complete rejection of disturbances. The reportedly superb system behavior of VSS and SMC naturally invites criticisms and scepticisms from within the research community, and from practicing control engineers alike <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref>. The sliding mode control research community has risen to answer to some of these critical challenges, while at the same time, contributed to the confusion about the robustness of SMC with incomplete analyses, and design fixes for the so-called chattering phenomenon <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Many analytical design methods were proposed to reduce the effects of chattering [4], [5], [6], [7],</p><p>[8]for it remains to be the only obstacle for sliding mode to become one of the most significant discoveries in modern control theory; and its potential seemingly limited by the imaginations of the control researchers <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to the previously works published since the 1977 article <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, which serve as a status overview [l2], a tu-[. Utkin, Umit Ozgiiner torial <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> of design methods, or another more recent state of the art assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, or yet another survey of sliding mode research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive guide to Sliding Mode Control for control engineers. It is our goal to accomplish these objectives:</p><p>Provide an accurate assessment of the chattering phenomenon; offer a catalog of implementable robust sliding mode control design solutions for real life engineering applications; initiate a dialog with practicing control engineers on sliding mode control by threading the many analytical underpinnings of sliding mode analysis through a series of design exercises on a simple, yet illustrative control problem; and establish a frame of reference for future sliding mode control research. The flow of the following presentation conforms to the historical development of VSS and SMC: First we introduce issues within Continuous Time Sliding Mode in Section 11, then in Section 111, we progress to Discrete time Sliding Mode, followed with Sampled Data SMC Design in Section IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">CONTINUOUS TIME SLIDING MODE</head><p>Sliding mode is originally conceived as system motion for dynamic systems whose essential open loop behavior can be modeled adequately with ordinary differential equations. The discontinuous control action, which is often referred to as Variable Structure Control (VSC), is also defined in the continuous time domain. The resulting feedback system, the so-called VSS, is also defined in the continuous time domain, and it is governed by ordinary differential equations with discontinuous right hand side. The manifold of the state space of the system on which sliding mode occurs is the Sliding Mode Manifold, or in brief, Sliding Manifold. For control engineers, the simplest, but vividly perceptible example is a double integrator plant, subject to time optimal control action. Due to imperfections in the implementations of the switching curve, derivable using the Pontrayagon Maximum Principle, sliding mode may occur. Sliding mode was studied in conjunction with relay control for double integrator plants, a problem motivated by the design of attitude control systems of missiles with jet thrusters in the 1950's <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The so-called chattering phenomenon is generally perceived as motion which oscillates about the sliding manifold. There are two possible mechanisms which produce such a motion. First, in the absence of switching nonidealities such as delays, i.e., when the switching device is ideally switching at an infinite frequency. In this case, the existence of parasitic dynamics in series with the plant. This may account for the otherwise negligible fast actuator and sensor dynamics, and cause a small amplitude high frequency oscillation to appear in the neighborhood of the sliding manifold. In control engineering practice, such fast dynamics are often neglected in the open loop model for control design if the associated poles are well damped, and outside the desired bandwidth of the feedback control system. Generally, the motion of the real system is close to that of an ideal system in which the parasitic dynamics are neglected, and the difference between the ideal and real motion, which is on the order of the neglected time constants, decays rapidly. The mathematical basis for the analysis of dynamic systems with fast motion is the theory of singularly perturbed differential equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, and its extensions to control theory have been developed and applied in practice [18]. However, the theory is not applicable for VSS since they are governed by differential equations with discontinuous right hand sides. The interactions between the parasitic dynamics and VSC generate a non-decaying oscillatory component of finite amplitude and frequency, and this is generically referred to as chattering.</p><p>Second, the switching nonidealities alone can cause such high frequency oscillations. We shall focus only on the delay type of switching nonidealities since it is most relevant to any electronic implementation of the switching device, including both analog and digital circuits, and microprocessor code executions. Since the cause of the resulting chattering phenomenon is due to time delays, discrete time control design techniques such as the design of an extrap olator exist to mitigate the switching delays [19]. These design approaches are perhaps more familiar to control engineers.</p><p>Unfortunately, in practice, both the parasitic dynamics and switching time delays exist. Since it is necessary to compensate for the switching delays by using a discrete time control design approach, a practical SMC design may have to be unavoidably approached in discrete time. We shall return to the details of discrete time SMC after we illustrate our earlier points on continuous time SMC with a simple design example, and summarize the existing approaches to avoid chattering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Chattering due to parasitic dynamicsa simple example</head><p>The effects of unmodeled dynamics on sliding mode can be illustrated with an extremely simple relay control system example: Let the nominal plant be an integrator,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">? = U , x ( t o ) = x o # O ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and assume that a relay controller has been designed, U = -sgn(z) .</p><p>(2)</p><p>The sliding "manifold is the origin of the state space x = 0. Given any nonzero initial condition 50, the state trajectory z ( t ) is driven toward the sliding manifold. Ide-s(t = 0 , t 2 t* where t* is the first time instant that z(t*) = 0, a.e., once the state trajectory reaches the sliding manifold, it remains on it for good. However, even with such idealized switching device, unmodeled dynamics can induce oscillations about the sliding manifold. Suppose we have ignored the existence of a second order "sensor" dynamics, and the true system dynamics are governed by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x = -sgn(x,) ,<label>( 3 )</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">p2x, + 2p4, + xs = 5 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">p &lt;&lt; 1 ,</formula><p>where z, and 5, are the states of the sensor dynamics.</p><p>Clearly, sliding mode cannot occur on z = 0 since x is continuous, however, since 4s is bounded, x,(t</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">) -x(t) = O(p)</formula><p>where p is the time constant of the sensor. Furthermore, reaching an O(p) boundary layer of z ( t ) = 0 is guaranteed since:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P, = -sgn(x, + O ( p ) ) .</formula><p>(5)</p><p>The system behavior inside this O ( p ) boundary layer can be analyzed with the infinitely fast switching device replaced with a linear gain approximation whose gain tends to infinity asymptotically:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(6) U = -g x s , g + m .</formula><p>The root locus of this system, with g as the scalar gain parameter, has third order asymptotes as g + CO. Therefore, the high frequency oscillation in the boundary layer is unstable.</p><p>With second order parasitic actuator dynamics in series with the nominal plant, the closed loop dynamics are given bY</p><p>The characteristic equation of this system is identical to that of the parasitic sensor case. This is not surprising since the forward transfer function is identical in both cases. Thus, similar instability also occur with infinitely fast switching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Boundary Layer Control</head><p>The most commonly cited approach to reduce the effects of "chattering" has been the so called piecewise linear or smooth approximation of the switching element in a boundary layer of the sliding manifold <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. Inside the boundary layer, the switching function is approximated by a linear gain. In order for the system behavior to be close to that of the ideal sliding mode, particularly when a significant unknown disturbance is to be rejected, sufficiently high gain is needed. Note that in the absence of disturbance, it is possible to enlarge the boundary layer thickness, and at the same time reduce the effective linear gain such that the resulting system no longer exhibits any oscillatory behavior about the sliding manifold, however, this system no longer behaves as dictated by sliding -~, ally, if the relay controller can switch infinitely fast, then mode, i.e., simply put, in order to reduce chattering, the proposed method of piecewise linear approximation reduces the feedback system to a system with no sliding mode. This proposed method has a wide acceptance by many sliding mode researchers, but unfortunately it does not resolve the core problem of the robustness of sliding mode as exhibited in chattering. Many sliding mode researchers cited the work in [3], <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> as the basis of their optimism that with boundary layer control, the implementation issues of continuous time sliding mode are solved. Unfortunately, the optimism of these researchers was not shared by practicing engineers, and this may be rightly so. The effectiveness of boundary layer control is immediately challenged when realistic parasitic dynamics are considered. An in-depth analysis of the interactions of parasitic actuator and sensor dynamics with the boundary layer control <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> revealed the shortcomings of this approach where parasitics dynamics must be carefully modeled and considered in the feedback design in order to avoid instability inside the boundary layer which leads to chattering. Without such information of the parasitic dynamics, control engineers must opt for a worst case boundary layer control design in which the disturbance rejection properties of SMC are severely compromised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.l A boundary layer controller</head><p>We shall continue with the simple relay control example, and consider the design of a boundary layer controller. We assume the same second order parasitic sensor dynamics as before. The behavior inside the boundary layer is describable by a linear closed loop system,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x = -gx, + d ( t ) , rzx, + 27,xy + x, = 2 , (9)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where d ( t ) represents a bounded, but unknown exogenous disturbance. Whereas discontinuous control action in VSC can reject bounded disturbances, by replacing the switching control with a. boundary layer control, the additional assumption that d be bounded is needed since according to singular perturbation analysis, the residue error is proportional to ldI/g. Given a finite T,, we can compute the root locus of this system with respect to the scalar positive gain g &gt; 0. An upperbound gc exists which specifies the crossover point of the root locus on the imaginary axis. Thus, for 0 &lt; g &lt; gc, the behavior of this system is asymptotically stable, i.e., for any initial point inside the boundary layer , the sliding manifold z = 0 is reached asymptotically as t ---f oc). The transient response and disturbance rejection of this feedback system are two competing performance measures to be balanced by the choice of an optimum gain value. If we assume p = .01, the associated root locus is plotted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> for 0.003 5 9-l 5 0.01 with a step size of 0.001, The critical gain is gc = 200. Thus from the linear analysis, a boundary layer control with g = 100 results in a stable sliding mode,whereas with g = 200, oscillatory behavior about the sliding manifold is predicted.</p><p>IXSI 5 1/91 <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref> Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the simulated error responses of the closed loop system for these two gain values which agree with the analysis. In this simulation, a unity reference command for the plant state and a constant disturbance d ( t ) = 0.5 is introduced. The tradeoff between chattering reduction and disturbance rejection can be observed from the steady state value of -0.005 in x ( t ) whose magnitude (for the stable response), or average value of -0.0025 (for the oscillatory response) is proportional to the gain g. We note that even with g &gt; gc, the resulting responses are only oscillatory, but still bounded. This is because the linear analysis is valid only inside the boundary layer, and the VSC always forces the state trajectory back into the boundary layer region. However, as the gain increases, the frequency of oscillation, related to the magnitude of the imaginary part of the root locus, also increases, hence the general description chattering applies as this frequency reaches the neglected resonant frequencies of the physical plant.</p><p>This example illustrates the advantages of boundary layer control which lie primarily in the availability of familiar linear control design tools to reduce the potentially disastrous chattering. However, it should also be reminded that if the acceptable closed loop gain has to be reduced sufficiently to avoid instability in the boundary layer, the resulting feedback system performance may be significantly inferior to the nominal system with ideal sliding mode. Furthermore, the precise details of the parasitic dynamics must be known and used properly in the linear design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Observer based Slzdzng Mode Control</head><p>Recognizing the essential triggering mechanism for chattering is due to the interactions of the switching action with the parasitic dynamics, an approach which utilizes asymptotic observers to construct a high frequency by pass loop has been proposed <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. This design exploits a localization of the high frequency phenomenon in the feedback loop by introducing a discontinuous feedback control loop which is closed through an asymptotic observer of the plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. Since the model imperfections of the observer are supposedly smaller than that in the plant, and the control is discontinuous only with respect to the observer variables, chattering is localized inside a high frequency loop which bypasses the plant. However, this approach assumes that an asymptotic observer can indeed be designed such that the observation error converges to zero asymptotically. We shall discuss the various options available in observer based sliding mode control in the following design example. C.l Design example of observer based SMC For the relay control example, we examine the utility of the observed based SMC in localizing the high frequency phenomenon. For the nominal plant, the following asymptotic observer results from applying conventional state space linear control design,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">k = h(s, -2 ) + U , (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where h &gt; 0 is the observer feedback gain, and x, is the output of the parasitic sensor dynamics. The SMC and the associated sliding manifold defined on the observer state space is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">U = -sgn(f) . (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>The behavior of the closed loop system can be deduced from the following fourth order system,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">A x = -sgn(z -e ) + d(t) , e = z -2 , (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">e = -he + h(z -a,) + d ( t ) , T;i?# + 2T,k, + 2 , = 5 . (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">) (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>First we consider the case when d(t) = 0. Using an infinite gain linear function g(z -e ) to approximate the switching function sgn(z -e ) , and since p is finite, the above system is a singular perturbed system with g-' being the parasitic parameter. The slow dynamics which are of third order can be extracted by formally setting 9-l = 0, and ze = 0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">1 = -hx,,<label>(17)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">r,"X, + Z T , ~, + z, = e . (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>It is possible to further apply a singular perturbation analysis to insure that given r8, there exists h &gt; 0 such that the asymptotic observer dynamics are of first order, and its eigenvalue is approximately -h. Clearly, the adverse effects of the parasitic sensor dynamics are neutralized with an observer based SMC design. If a switching function is realized in the SMC design, the only remaining concerns will be switching time delays, and if the observer is to be implemented in discrete time, the entire feedback design including the compensation of switching time delays may be best carried out in the discrete time domain. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> is a block diagram of this design. Note that the switching element is inside a feedback loop which passes through only the observer, bypassing both blocks of the plant dynamics. This is the so-called high frequency bypass effects of the observer based SMC [4], <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</p><p>When d ( t ) # 0, its effects on the convergence of asymptotic observers are well known. If d ( t ) is an unknown constant disturbance, a multivariable servomechanism formulation can be adopted to estimate both the state and exogenous disturbance in a composite asymptotic observer. The resulting feedback system is the so-called Variable Structure (VS) Servomechanism design <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>For bounded but unknown disturbances with bounded time derivative, the only known approach to solving the robustness of the asymptotic observer is to introduce a high gain loop around the observer itself to reject the unknown disturbance, e.g., by increasing the gain h in the observer such that the effects of d ( t ) are adequately attenuated. However, the requirements for disturbance attenuation and closed loop stability must be balanced in the design, and if sliding mode is to be preserved in the manifold 2 = 0, g must be sufficiently larger than h. A switching function implementation of the SMC would seem to ensure the necessary time scale separations, however, the condition g &lt;&lt; 117, should also be imposed to avoid adverse interactions with the parasitic dynamics. Note that if the high gain loop in the asymptotic observer is implemented with a switching function, it is referred to as a Sliding Mode Observer [28], [29], [30]. Since two sliding manifolds are employed in the feedback loops, the closed loop system robustness must be carefully examined when less than infinite switching frequencies are to be expected. In such robustness analysis, the relative time scales of the various motions in the system can be managed with singular perturbation methods, similar to that applied to high gain observers.</p><p>The performance of the observer based SMC can be evaluated by simulation. We let the sensor dynamic time constant be T, = 0.01, and assume the same unity reference command and constant disturbance as in the boundary layer control example, d ( t ) = 0.5. A boundary layer of 0.002 is used to approximate the observer based SMC. The closed loop eigenvalues are at {-5lO(due to boundary layer), -12.92(from observer), -59.44, -127.62(shifted sensor poles). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows the error response between the reference and the observed state. The steady state error of -0.001 reflects the attenuation of the disturbance by the high gain of 500. Note that sliding mode in the observer state space can be implemented with high gain with no adverse interactions with the parasitic dynamics. However, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> , the plant state response has a steady state error of 0.05 which is due to the observation error caused by the relatively low feedback gain of the observer, h = 10. This error can be reduced by increasing the value of gain h, provided that the time scales and stability of the system are preserved. Also shown in this figure is the superb rejection of the disturbance in the observer based sliding mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Disturbance Compensation</head><p>In SMC, the main purpose of sliding mode is to reject disturbances and to desensitize unknown parametric perturbations. Building on the observer based SMC, a sliding mode disturbance estimator which uses sliding mode to estimate the unknown disturbances and parametric uncertainties has also been introduced <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. In this approach, the control law consists of a conventional continuous feedback control component, and a component derived from the SM disturbance estimator for disturbance compensation. If the disturbance is sufficiently compensated, there is no longer the need to evoke a discontinuous feedback control to achieve sliding mode, thus, the remaining control design follows the conventional wisdom, and issues regarding unmodeled dynamics are no longer critical. Also chattering becomes a non-issue since a conventional feedback control instead of SMC is applied. The critical design issues are transferred to the SM disturbance estimator and its associated sliding mode. While there are many engineering issues to be dealt with in this approach, simulation studies and experiment results <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> showing that desired objectives are indeed achievable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.l An SM disturbance estimator</head><p>Once again we return to the simple relay example with parasitic sensor dynamics for our design of a disturbance estimator. The plant model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">j. = U + d ( t ) , T Z X , + 27,xs + x,3 = x . (19) (20)</formula><p>We shall design a disturbance estimator with sliding mode as follows:</p><p>From the error dynamics,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">f = U + sgn(x, -2 ) . (21) a e = -sgn(z, -2 ) + d ( t ) + S, -k , (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>if sliding mode occurs on e = 0, since u ( t ) is continuous and differentiable, /Ssj.1 = O ( r S ) . By solving for the equivalent control in d = 0, e = x, -2 , Thus, within this estimator, there exists a signal which, under the sliding mode condition, is O(7,) close to the unknown disturbance d ( t ) . This forms the basis of a feedback control design which utilizes this signal to compensate the disturbance to O ( T ~) .</p><p>The resulting control law has a conventional linear feedback component, and a disturbance compensating component, and for this system</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">U = -kf -[sgn(s, -?)Ieq. (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>The extraction of the equivalent control from the sliding model control signal is by low pass filtering. While theoretically there exists such a low pass filter such that the equivalent control can be found, in practice, the bandwidth of the desired closed loop system, the spectrum of the disturbance, are all important to the selection of the cutoff frequency of this filter.</p><p>For evaluation by simulation, we let the sensor time constant be once again T, = 0.01, and assume the same unity reference command, and constant disturbance d ( t ) = 0.5.</p><p>After canceling the disturbance, we desire a closed loop system with a time constant of one seconds which can be attained with k = 2. A boundary layer of 5 x replaces the switching function in the estimator. The closed loop eigenvalues are { -2000. (from the boundary layer), -1 ,(the dominant closed loop pole), -96.75 i 3101.83(the shifted sensor poles). For low pass filtering, a third order butterworth filter with a 3dB corner frequency of 50 rad./sec. is used to filter the equivalent control. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the error between the reference command and the plant state which exhibits the desired one seconds time constant transient behavior, with the exception of initial minor distortions which are due to the convergence of the disturbance estimate shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Despite the constant disturbance, the steady state error is zero. While standard PID controllers can achieve the same zero steady state error in the presence of unknown constant disturbance, the tracking error is regulated to zero even when d ( t ) is time varying as it is reported before [8].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Actuator Bandluidth Constraints</head><p>Despite its desirable properties, VSC is mostly restricted to control engineering problems where the control input of the plant is, by the nature of the control actuator, necessarily discontinuous. Such problems include control of electric drives where pulse-width-modulation is not the exception, but the rule of the game. Space vehicle attitude control is another example where reaction jets operated in an on-off mode are commonly used. The third example, which is closely related to the first one, is power converter and inverter feedback control design. For this class of applications, the chattering phenomenon still need to be addressed, however, the arguments against using sliding mode in the feedback design are weakened. The issue in this case is whether VSC should be utilized to improve system performance, or standard PWM techniques are to be applied, after a standard PID type design is completed, to realize a low bandwidth servo loop. If VSC is to be used, by adopting an observer based SMC, the high frequency components of the discontinuous control can be bypassed, and consequently, adverse interactions with the unmodeled dynamics which causes chattering are avoided.</p><p>In plants where control actuators have limited bandwidth, e.g., hydraulic actuators, there are two possibilities: First, the actuator bandwidth is outside the required closed loop bandwidth. Thus the actuator dynamics become unmodeled dynamics, and our discussions in the previous sections are applicable. While in linear control design, it is possible to ignore the actuator dynamics, doing so in VSC requires extreme care. By ignoring actuator dynamics in a classical SMC design, chattering is likely to occur since the switching frequency is limited by the actuator dynamics even in the absence of parasitic dynamics. Strictly speaking, sliding mode cannot occur, since the control input to the plant is continuous.</p><p>Second, the desired closed loop bandwidth is beyond the actuator bandwidth. In this case, regardless of whether SMC or other control designs are to be used, the actuator dynamics are lumped together with the plant, and the control design model encompasses the actuator-plant in series. With the actuator dynamics no longer negligible, often the matching conditions which are satisfied in the nominal plant model are violated. This results from having dominant dynamics inserted between the physical input, such as force, and the controller output, usually an electrical signal. The design of SMC which incorporates the actuator dynamics as a prefilter for the VSC was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This design utilizes an expansion of the original state space by including state derivatives, and formulate an SMC design such that the matching condition is indeed satisfied in the extended space. Another alternative approach is to utilize sliding mode to estimate the disturbance for compensation as discussed earlier. Since sliding mode is not introduced primarily to reject disturbances, the matching conditions are of no significance in this design. Provided that a suitable sliding mode exists such that the disturbance can be estimated from the corresponding equivalent control, this approach resolves the limitations imposed by actuator bandwidth constraints on the design of sliding mode based controllers. E.l An SMC Design with Pre-Filter plant, and actuator dynamics, We shall use the example with a nominal integrator</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">x = 2 , + d ( t ) , c y 2 x , + 2aXa + 5 , = U , (<label>25</label></formula><p>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref> to illustrate this design. The actuator bandwidth limitation is expressed in the time constant cy. Given a discontinuous input u(t), the rate of change of the actuator output x a ( t ) is limited by the finite magnitude of cy. However, in order for the disturbance d ( t ) to be rejected, za(t) must be an SMC. Also if x, can be designed as a control input, then the matching condition is clearly satisfied. But since U is the actual input, the matching condition does not holds for finite a. The design begins with an assumption that d ( t ) has continuous first and second derivatives, and the definitions of new state variables,</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">x 1 = x , x 2 = X C , x 3 = x . (<label>27</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>The control U is designed as an VSC with respect to the sliding manifold,</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">4 x 1 , x2, x3) = ClXl + c2x2 + x3 = 0 .</formula><p>With the equivalent control ueq computed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> the resulting sliding mode dynamics are found to be composed of two subsystems in series:</p><p>x</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">+ c2x + c1x = 0 ,<label>(30) (31)</label></formula><p>x, = (c; -Cl)* + c1c2x -di.</p><p>This design shows that although the embedded prefilter in the plant model destroys the matching condition, an SMC can still be designed to reject the unknown disturbance. However, it is necessary to restrict the class of disturbances to those which have bounded derivatives. Furthermore, derivatives of the state are also required in the design.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Frequency Shapzng</head><p>An approach which has been advocated for attenuating the effects of unmodeled parasitic dynamics in sliding mode involves the introduction of frequency shaping in the design of the sliding manifold <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. In stead of treating the sliding manifold as the intersection of hyperplanes defined in the state space of the plant, sliding manifolds which are defined as linear operators are introduced to suppress frequency components of the sliding mode response in a designated frequency band. For unmodeled high frequency dynamics, this approach implants a low pass filter either as a prefilter, similar to introducing an artificial actuator dynamics, or as a post-filter, functioning like sensor dynamics. The premise of this so-called Frequency Shaped Sliding Mode design, which was motivated by flexible robotic manipulator control applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, is that the effects of parasitic dynamics are as critical on the sliding manifold. However, robustness to chattering was not addressed in this design. By combining frequency shaping sliding mode and the SMC designs introduced earlier, the effects of parasitic dynamics on switching induced oscillations, as well as their long term interactions with sliding mode dynamics can be handled.</p><p>F.l A frequency shaped SMC design dynamics, we introduce a frequency shaping post-filter, For the nominal integrator plant with parasitic sensor</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">xp + 2w,xp + w;x, = 2 , ,<label>(34)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">(35) Yp = Plkp + p 2 z p</formula><p>The sliding manifold is defined as a linear operator, which can be expressed as a linear transfer function, Given an estimate of the lower bound of the bandwidth of parasitic dynamics, the post-filter parameter wp can be chosen to impose a frequency dependent weighting function in a linear quadratic optimal design whose solution provides an optimal sliding manifold.

Robust Control Design based on Lyapunov Method</head><p>For plants whose dynamic models are uncertain, robust control design which utilizes Lyapunov functions of the nominal plant has been proposed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(41)</head><p>Since sliding mode is the principle mechanism with which uncertainties and disturbances are rejected in robust control of uncertain systems, the robustness of these feedback controllers with respect to unmodeled dynamics are identical to continuous time SMC, and the respective engineering design issues can be addressed as outlined in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">DISCRETE TIME SLIDING MODE</head><p>While it is an accepted practice for control engineers to consider the design of feedback systems in the continuous time domain -a practice which is based on the notion that, with sufficiently fast sampling rate, the discrete time implementation of the feedback loops is merely a matter of convenience due to the increasingly affordable micropre cessor. The essential conceptual framework of the feedback design remains to be in the continuous time domain. For VSS and SMC, the notion of sliding mode subsumes a continuous time plant, and a continuous time feedback control, albeit its discontinuous, or switching characteristics. However, Sliding Mode, with its conceptually continuous time characteristics, is more difficult to quantify when a discrete time implementation is adopted. When control engineers approach discrete time control, the choice of sampling rate is an immediate, and extremely critical design decision, unfortunately, in continuous time Sliding Mode, desired closed loop bandwidth does not provide any useful guidelines for the selection of sampling rate. In the previous section, we indicate that asymptotic observers or sliding mode observers can be constructed to eliminate chattering. Observers are most likely constructed in discrete time for any real life control design. However, in order for these observer-based design to work, sampling rate has to be relatively high since the notion of continuous time sliding mode is still applied.</p><p>For Sliding Mode, the continuous time definition and its associated design approaches for discrete time control implementation have been redefined to cope with the finite time update limitations of discrete time controllers. Discrete time Sliding Mode (DSM) was introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> for discrete time plants. The most striking contrast between SM and DSM is that DSM may occur in discrete time systems with continuous right hand side, thus discontinuous control and Sliding Mode, are finally separable. In discrete time, the notion of VSS is no longer a necessity in dealing with motion on a Sliding Manifold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SAMPLED DATA SLIDING MODE CONTROL DESIGN</head><p>We shall limit our discussions to plant dynamics which can be adequately modeled by finite dimensional ordinary differential equations, and assume that an apriori bandwidth of the closed loop system has been defined. The feedback controller is assumed to be implemented in discrete time form. The desired closed loop behavior includes insensitivity to significant parameter uncertainties and rejection of exogenous disturbances. Without such a demand on the closed loop performance, it is not worthwhile to evoke DSM in the design. Using conventional design rule of thumb for sampled data control systems, it is reasonable to assume that for the discretization of the continuous time plant, we include only the dominant modes of the plant whose corresponding corner frequencies are well within the sampling frequency. This is always achievable in practice by anti-aliasing filters which are inserted at the plant outputs. Actuator dynamics are assumed to be of higher frequencies than the sampling frequency. Otherwise, actuator dynamics will have to be handled as part of the dominant plant dynamics. Thus, all the undesirable parasitic dynamics manifest only in the between sampling plant behavior, which by default of using sampled data control, is essentially the open loop behavior of the plant. Clearly, this removes any remote possibilities of chattering due to the interactions of sliding mode control with the parasitic dynamics.</p><p>We begin to summarize sampled data sliding mode con-trol designs with the well understood sample and hold process. This may seem to be elementary at first glance, it is however worthwhile since the matching conditions for the continuous time plant are only satisfied in an approximation sense in the discretized models. We shall restrict our discussions to linear time-invariant plants with uncertainties and exogenous disturbances,</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">? = A x + B u + E d , Z E I R ~, Z L E I R ~, ~E I R ' (42)</formula><p>where A , B, E are constant matrices, and d ( t ) is the exogenous disturbance.

The desired closed loop bandwidth is</p><p>given to be about one Hz. A good choice of the sampling frequency would be about 10 Hz (T=0.1) since the sensor dynamics are of 50 Hz, and therefore can be neglected initially in the design. The DSM control takes the form of From an engineering design perspective, the O ( T 2 ) models are adequate since the between sample behavior of the continuous time plant is also O ( T 2 ) close to the values at where x i = z,(kT) is the sampled value of the sensor output z,(t). Note that due to the control bounds, a linear feedback control law is applied inside a boundary layer of thickness 2T about the sliding manifold xi = 0. Without sensor dynamics, the behavior inside the boundary layer is that of a deadbeat controller. The sensor dynamics impose a third order discrete time system inside this boundary layer, and its eigenvalues are inside the unit circle at {-0.002,O.l -f 110.436). For reference, the discrete model of the open loop nominal plant and the sensor dynamics has a pair of double real pole almost at the origin (4.54 x lop5), which result from sampling at a frequency much lower than the sensor's 3dB corner frequency, and a pole at unity which is due to the integrator plant. The third order system response can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> where the sample values of the error between the constant unity reference command and the sensor output is plotted. Note that only the behavior inside the boundary layer is shown, and it agrees well with the predicted third order behavior. The steady state error magnitude of 0.05 is due to the constant disturbance d ( t ) = 0.5 as applied to this plant before, and the effective loop gain being T-l = 10. </p></div>

However, as compared with the ideal continuous time sliding mode, we should also be realistic about the limitations of DSM control designs in rejecting disturbances, and i n its ability to w i t h s t a n d p a r a m e t e r variations.
