<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N response to the demand for higher bit rates in wireless local-area networks (LANs), researchers have explored the use of multiple-element arrays (MEAs) at both the transmitter and the receiver. Signals propagating through the wireless channel experience path loss and distortion due to multipath fading and additive noise. These impairments, along with the constraints of power and bandwidth, limit the system capacity. In the past, multiple antennas have been used at the receiver to combat multipath fading, e.g., using maximal-ratio combining <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, or to suppress interfering signals, e.g., using optimal combining <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Recent studies report that in single-user, point-topoint links, using MEAs at both transmitter and receiver increases the capacity significantly over single-antenna systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Foschini and Gans have analyzed the information-theoretic capacity of MEA systems in a narrow-band Rayleigh-fading environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. They consider independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) fading at different antenna elements, and assume that the transmitter does not know the channel. With transmitting and receiving antennas, the MEA mutual information with equal-power allocation is reported to grow linearly with for a given fixed average transmitter power. An MEA system achieves almost more bits per hertz for every 3-dB increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high SNR, compared to the single-antenna case, which only achieves one additional bit per hertz for every 3-dB increase in SNR.</p><p>In practice, correlation exists between the signals transmitted by or received at different antenna elements. Correlation can arise if the elements are not spaced sufficiently far apart. For example, Lee pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that in order to obtain a correlation coefficient at adjacent elements less than , the elements must be spaced by about 15-20 wavelengths in the broadside case and 70 wavelengths in the inline case. The presence of a dominant line-of-sight component can also affect the MEA capacities. It is important to understand the impact of these factors on MEA system capacity.</p><p>The goal of this paper is to explore the capacities of singleuser MEA systems in a more realistic propagation environment, where the fading is correlated. We consider the performance in two scenarios: 1) the transmitter knows the channel, so that optimal transmit power allocation (also known as water filling) can be used; 2) the transmitter does not know the channel, so that equal power is allocated to each of the transmit antenna elements. In both cases, it is assumed that the receiver knows the channel perfectly. We study the behavior of MEA capacities through analysis and simulation.</p><p>The multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) fading channel is modeled as a random matrix . The water-filling capacity and the mutual information under equal power allocation of a by system are random variables, being functions of the singular values of the random . We construct a fading correlation structure assuming separable transmit/receive correlations, and derive the large system limiting distribution of the singular values of in two cases: a) when the fades between different antenna pairs are independent and b) when these fades are correlated. Using these results, we show almost-sure convergence of the asymptotic growth rate and . In both the independent and correlated fading cases, the capacity and mutual information grow linearly with but the growth rate is different when the fades are correlated. In particular, we show that under correlated fading, the growth rate of is smaller at all SNRs compared to the independent fading case, while the growth rate of is smaller at high SNR but larger at low SNR. Our hypothesized fading correlation structure is studied carefully via simulation based on a ray-tracing propagation model. We use the WiSE (Wireless System Engineering) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> software tool to model explicitly the channel response between a transmitter and a receiver placed inside an office building. Comparing the empirical capacity distribution with the asymptotic theory, reasonable agreement is found even for moderate . Initial results can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We also quantify the capacity improvements achieved by water filling over the equal power strategy empirically at different SNR levels.</p><p>An alternative approach to ray-tracing simulations is to use scattering models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to characterize the spatial fading correlations. In independent work, Shiu et al. quantify the effect of fading correlations on MEA capacity in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> by employing such an abstract scattering model.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we model the channel as a MIMO system with flat frequency response. Using this mathematical model, we define information-theoretic capacity and mutual information of MEA systems in Section III, and analyze their asymptotic behavior as in Section IV. In Section V, we present capacity estimates for the simulated channels and discuss the discrepancies between these results and the asymptotic capacities predicted by theory. We briefly describe how WiSE is used to model the indoor propagation environment that our numerical analysis is based on. We also include details about placements of transmitting and receiving MEAs, arrangement of antennas in an array, and basic assumptions about the antenna elements. Conclusions are presented in Section VI.</p><p>To simplify notations, we will focus exclusively on the case when the number of transmit antenna is equal to the number of receive antenna ( by systems). The extension of the analytical results to the case with unequal number of transmit and receive antennas is straightforward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CHANNEL MODEL</head><p>The following notation is used throughout the paper: for vector transpose, for transpose conjugate, for the identity matrix, for expectation, and underline for vectors. All logarithms are with respect to base .</p><p>We consider a single-user,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> point-to-point communication channel with transmitting and receiving antenna elements, denoted as an -MEA system. We assume that the transmitted signal occupies a bandwidth , over which the channel frequency response is essentially constant. For this assumption to be valid, must be much smaller than the channel coherence bandwidth, which is approximately the reciprocal of the channel delay spread. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> Since the maximum delay spread of our channels is about 25 ns, we require that be much less than 40 MHz. Assuming zero excess bandwidth, this requires a symbol rate much less than 40 Mbaud.</p><p>For the remaining analysis and discussions, we assume that the channel is linear and time-invariant and use the following discrete-time equivalent model:</p><p>(1) is an vector whose th component represents the signal transmitted by the th antenna. Similarly, the received signal and received noise are represented by vectors, and , respectively, where and represent the signal and noise received at the th antenna. The complex path gain between transmitter and receiver is represented by . We further assume the following.</p><p>• The total average power (sum over all transmitting antennas) is , regardless of . • The noise vector is an additive white complex Gaussian random vector, whose entries are i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variables with variance where is the signal bandwidth.</p><p>We consider the following two cases.</p><p>1) is known only to the receiver but not the transmitter. Power is distributed equally over all transmitting antennas in this case.</p></div>

On the other hand, changes if the receiver is moved from one place to the other, and we assume this will happen over a time scale much longer than the duration of communication. The associated capacity and mutual information and for each specific realization of can be viewed as random variables. We are interested in studying the statistics of these random variables, in particular, the averages, and and the values at 5% channel outage, and .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MEA CAPACITY AND MUTUAL INFORMATION</head><p>Channel capacity is defined as the highest rate at which information can be sent with arbitrarily low probability of error. Since the channel is considered quasi-static, it is reasonable to associate the capacity to a specific realization of , given a fixed average total power and noise variance (see Section II for channel model and assumptions). Throughout our analysis, we assume that are identically distributed with the variance normalized to be . Therefore, the average received SNR is defined as When antennas are used, we denote the MEA capacity with water filling and mutual information with equal-power allocation as and , respectively. For the case with , the Shannon capacity is b/s/Hz.</p><p>(2)</p><p>In the high-SNR regime, each 3-dB increase of yields a capacity increase of 1 b/s/Hz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Capacity With Water-Filling Power Allocation</head><p>In this subsection, we derive the MEA capacity assuming the transmitter has perfect knowledge about the channel. With this knowledge of the channel, the total transmit power can be allocated in the most efficient way over the different transmitters to achieve the highest possible bit rate. Based on the model in Section II and definitions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the MEA capacity with optimal power allocation is b/s/Hz <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where is the covariance matrix of and must satisfy the average power constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> The optimal solution is <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and the are the eigenvalues of . The optimal solutions given in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) are analogous to the optimal power allocation calculated through the water-filling algorithm for parallel Gaussian channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Intuitively, ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> suggest that the original MIMO channel can be decomposed into parallel independent subchannels, and we allocate more power to the subchannels with higher SNR . Here, is the "water level" that marks the height of the power that is poured into the "water vessel" formed by the function . Each of these subchannels contributes to the total capacity through . If , we say that this subchannel provides an effective mode of transmission and is called a strong eigenmode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Mutual Information With Equal-Power Allocation</head><p>In this case, we assume that equal power is radiated from each transmitting antenna, which is a natural thing to do when the transmitter does not know the channel. The mutual information of -MEAs with equal-power allocation is b/s/Hz (7)</p><p>Applying singular-value decomposition to , we can write (7) as</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS</head><p>The capacity and mutual information depend on , which is random in a fading environment. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of and as for two cases: a) when the are independent, and b) when the are correlated. Our analysis is based on the channel model and properties described in Sections II and III. In all cases, we normalize for all . For clarity, let us use and to explicitly denote the dependency on .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Independent Fading</head><p>We first assume that the path gains are i.i.d. for all and . We scale up the size of the MEA by letting grow large. For each , let be the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of , i.e., for each the fraction of squared singular values of less than or equal to . Note that since the singular values are random, so is the empirical distribution. An important observation is that, from the expressions ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), both the capacity and the mutual information under equal-power allocation depends on only through the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues. The asymptotic properties of the random variables and hinge on how the (random) empirical distribution of the singular values behaves as . We have the following theorem (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>).</p><p>Theorem IV.1: Define . Then almost surely, converges in distribution to a limit , which has a density given by else.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(8) Moreover, if</formula><p>is the largest eigenvalue of , then almost surely This result says several interesting things. First, the scaling by in the definition of means that the eigenvalues are growing of the order of . After rescaling, the random distribution converges to a deterministic limiting distribution, i.e., for large , the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues looks similar for almost all realizations of . Moreover, the limit does not depend on the distribution of the entries .</p><p>The asymptotic behavior of the mutual information follows directly from this proposition where the convergence is almost surely. This observation was previously made by Foschini <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The integral can actually be computed in closed form, as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in the context of a related capacity analysis problem for randomly spread codedivision multiple-access (CDMA) systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> We now turn to the water-filling capacity. By relabeling the parameter as we can rewrite ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) as where satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> As , the empirical distribution of converges almost surely to a limit with density . From <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, we see that converges to satisfying the equation and converges almost surely to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Thus, when both the transmitter and the receiver have perfect knowledge of the fading channel, the capacity scales like , where can be interpreted as the capacity of a fading channel with fading distribution when water filling over the fading state is performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Similarly, when only the receiver has knowledge of the channel and the transmitter allocates an equal amount of power to each transmit antenna, the achievable mutual information scales like , where can be interpreted as the mutual information achieved by using constant transmit power in a fading channel with the gain distributed as . We conclude that both and scale linearly with but the rate of growth is larger for than is for . Moreover, if we let be the -outage capacity, i.e., such that then the above results implies that for all . This is because almost-sure convergence implies convergence in probability. This means that for large , the capacity becomes insensitive to the realization of . Similar comments apply to the scaling of . We now compare and in both the low-and high-SNR regimes.</p><p>As a first-order approximation, at low SNR <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> We observe that at low SNR, depends only on the average SNR and not on the eigenvalue distribution .</p><p>For the capacity, we calculate <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where is the water-filling level. As approaches , approaches . To first order, at low SNR and we conclude that Hence, the water-filling strategy affords a significant performance gain over the constant-power strategy at low SNR. The intuition is that when there is little transmit power, it is much more effective to expend it on the strongest eigenmode of the system (with gain ) rather than spread the power evenly across all modes.</p><p>Next we consider the high-SNR regime. Using the explicit expression (9), we see that as a result already noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>At high SNR, it is well known that the water-filling and the constant power strategies yield almost the same performance and hence has the same high-SNR approximation of . Although water filling does not always give significant capacity improvements over the equal-power strategy, the perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter often leads to easier and more reliable implementations of the receiver, since the receiver can now be dealing with decoupled channels instead of having to perform cancellation and nulling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Correlated Fading 1) Correlation Model:</head><p>In the previous subsection, we assumed that the fades between different antenna pairs are independent of each other. We will now consider the situation when the fading between antenna pairs is correlated. While the results we obtained for the independent fading case holds for any distribution of the individual , the results we present here for the correlated case are only for the case of a Rayleigh-fading model. Each of the are assumed to be complex, zero-mean, circular symmetric Gaussian random variables with variance . The are jointly Gaussian with the following covariance structure: where and are by covariance matrices. This fading model embodies three assumptions.</p><p>• The correlation between the fading from transmit antennas and to the same receive antenna is and does not depend on the receive antenna;</p><p>describes the transmit correlation.</p><p>• The correlation between the fading from a transmit antenna to receive antenna and to receive antenna is and does not depend on the transmit antenna; describes the receive correlation.</p><p>• The correlation between the fading of two distinct antenna pairs is the product of the corresponding transmit correlation and receive correlation.</p><p>The first two assumptions are usually quite accurate when antenna elements are colocated in the same physical unit at the transmitter and also at the receiver. The product-form assumption is made for analytical tractability and can be thought of as a first-order approximation of the correlation structure when the fading from two transmit antennas to the same receive antenna and the fading from two receive antennas to the same transmit antenna is much more highly correlated than that between two distinct antenna pairs. This product form assumption is studied through simulations in Section V.</p><p>To consider the scaling of capacity and mutual information with the number of antennas, we need to make further assumptions on the covariance matrices and as the system scales. In particular, we assume that the empirical eigenvalue distributions of and converge in distribution to some limiting distributions and , respectively. This will be true if 1) the correlation between the fading at two antennas depends only on the relative and not absolute positions of the antennas; 2) the antennas are arranged in some regular arrays, such as square or linear grids, and as we scale up the number of antennas, the relative position of adjacent antennas are fixed; and 3) the correlation decays sufficiently fast over space.</p><p>For example, if the antennas are arranged in a linear array, and are Toeplitz. If the power spectral densities of the stationary processes and exist at all frequencies, then the limiting eigenvalue distributions and of and exist. For a given , is the fraction of frequencies in the power spectral density of with power less than or equal to . Motivated by this example, we will in general define and defined in this way is always nondecreasing from to . One can think of and as power spectral densities except that the frequencies are reordered such that they are always nondecreasing functions of . In the results to be presented, the ordering is immaterial and only the distribution of powers is relevant. We also observe that because for all . It should be noted that the power spectral densities of some fading correlation models may not exist at all frequencies. An example is Jakes' model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, with the "U-shaped" power spectral density which is bounded over only a finite interval. The reason is that the autocorrelation function decays slowly as a function of distance , like . The results below do not apply to such models.</p><p>2) Analysis: The starting point of the analysis is that can be factorized in the form , where the entries of are i.i.d. complex circular symmetric Gaussian with mean and variance . Hence, For capacity analysis, we are interested in the eigenvalue distribution of , or equivalently . Now is isotropic, i.e., and have the same distribution as for any deterministic unitary matrix . We can factorize and , where and are unitary and are diagonal. The fact that is isotropic allows us to conclude that the matrix has the same eigenvalue distribution as . It should be noted that as , the eigenvalue distributions of and converge to and , respectively. Theorem IV.1 tells us that the distribution of the eigenvalues of , scaled by , converges for large . It turns out that the eigenvalue distribution of converges as well under the same scaling. However, in this case, no explicit expression for the limiting distribution is available. Instead, it is given in terms of its Steltjes' transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> The proof of this result, which is based on random matrix results in Girko <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, is given in Appendix II.</p><p>Using this result, it can now be shown, exactly as in the independent fading case, that almost surely as where ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> with satisfying</p><p>The important conclusion is that even with correlation, the capacity and mutual information still scale linearly with . However, the rate of growth is different from the independent fading case. It should be emphasized that this conclusion is valid only under the specific scaling assumptions we made.</p><p>The constants and depend on the limiting distribution , which is only indirectly characterized via its Steltjes' transform in Theorem IV.2. The following result gives a more direct characterization of the constant without involving the Steltjes' transform of .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem IV.3:</head><p>and for each is the unique solution to the fixed-point equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> For the special case of no correlation at the receiver (i.e., for all ), the fixed-point equation that must satisfy is simplified to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> The proof of this result exploits the fact that the mutual information can be achieved by a combination of successive decoding and linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) demodulation. A sketch of this proof can be found in Appendix III.</p><p>Does correlation always reduce capacity? Let us fix the transmit correlation and compare the performance when there is correlation at the receiver and when there is none. Since the function is concave for , it follows from Jensen's inequality that in Theorem IV.3 for all . Hence, for a given , if and , then</p><p>. By monotonicity of the fixed-point equation , this implies Hence, correlation at the receiver always decreases . By the reciprocity property (see Appendix I), it can be seen that correlation at the transmit antenna always reduces for a fixed receive correlation . A more general statement can be made to compare the performance under two different power spectra. A nondecreasing spectrum is defined to be more spread out than a nondecreasing if and for every Note that the flat spectrum corresponding to independent fading is the least spread out according to this definition: there is the same amount of power at all frequencies. This notion of "spreading out" (also called majorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>) can be taken as a measure of the strength of correlation: the more spread out the spectrum, the stronger the correlation.</p><p>In the theory of majorization, a real-valued function is said to be Schur-concave (resp., Schur-convex) if is more (resp., less) spread out than implies that . A basic result says that the function: is Schur-concave (resp., Schur-convex) if the function is concave (resp., convex). Applying this result to our problem, it follows that the right-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is a Schur-concave function of . It then follows that is, in fact, a Schur-concave function of , i.e., stronger correlation always decreases . The above discussion focuses on the effect of fading correlation on the mutual information . But, in fact, something more basic is going on. It is shown in Appendix IV that the more spread out are the power spectra and , the more spread out is , the limiting spectrum of . The mutual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, being a Schur-concave function of , therefore, decreases with stronger correlation. However, the water-filling capacity is not a Schur-concave function of , and hence similar conclusions cannot be drawn.</p><p>We now focus on the low-SNR and high-SNR regimes. At low SNR, it follows from ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) that depends only on the average received SNR and does not depend on the eigenvalue distribution</p><p>. Hence, at low SNR, fading correlation has no effect on the mutual information achieved by the equal transmit power strategy. On the other hand, the water-filling capacity at low SNR is approximately the average received SNR amplified by the upper limit of the eigenvalue distribution . Since the stronger the correlation, the more is spread out, this upper limit increases and hence the water-filling capacity at low SNR actually increases as the correlation becomes stronger.</p><p>At high SNR, the difference approaches and hence both are reduced by fading. To calculate , let us make the substitution . Taking the limit as in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), we see that and satisfies the fixed-point equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> for . The high-SNR approximation of is therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> This can be simplified further. By the reciprocity property (see Appendix I), we know that . From this we can conclude that Let us set for all . From <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, we get</p><p>On the other hand, Equating these two expressions, we get Now Substituting these equations into <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, we get <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> We observe that the first term is the high-SNR capacity for independent fading. Hence, the second and third terms represent the capacity penalty due to correlation at the transmit and receive sides, respectively. The fact that they are not positive follows directly from Jensen's inequality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Methodology and Assumptions</head><p>We use the WiSE ray-tracing simulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to construct random instances of channel matrix for indoor wireless environment. WiSE allows us to specify the floor plan of a building (e.g., location of vertical walls, ceilings, corridors, etc.) and generate the corresponding propagation models inside the building. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the reflection/refraction coefficients and scattering effect for different building materials are derived from a multilayer dielectric model. For our numerical study, we consider the indoor wireless environment of a two-floor office building at Crawford Hill, NJ (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). We place the transmitting MEA on the first floor ceiling near the middle of the office building throughout our study. Receiving MEAs are placed with random rotations at 1000 randomly chosen positions in Room A, which is at intermediate distance from the transmitter. We consider a carrier frequency of 5.2 GHz, i.e., wavelength 5.8 cm. The MEAs consist of multiple omnidirectional antennas, arranged either in square grids or linear arrays within horizontal planes. The separation between antenna elements is the same at both the transmitting and receiving MEAs. We consider and , unless specified otherwise.</p><p>The power of the rays impinging on the receiving antennas is recorded when the carrier is launched from the transmitting MEA with power dBm. The impulse response between a specific transmitting-receiving antenna pair is modeled as the vector sum of all the rays arriving at the receiving antenna as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> where , , and are the received power, phase angle, and time delay of the th ray, respectively.</p><p>is the total number of rays and is the delta impulse function. With narrow-band assumption, we compute the frequency response at infinitesimally small bandwidth centered at the carrier frequency as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> is computed using <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and , , and are obtained from the WiSE simulation. All the elements are complex numbers in this case.</p><p>Since varies for different receiver locations, we estimate the channel variance by averaging over 1000 realizations of , and over all possible antenna pairs, to . We assume that the average received SNR , as defined in Section III, should be high enough for low-error-rate communication. If SNR is too low, we need very complex codes to provide enough redundancy to combat the noise so that we can recover the desired signal with low error probability at the receiver. The practical constraints on analog-to-digital (A/D) converters that are available with current technology limit the maximum SNR that can be exploited effectively. Thus, we consider SNRs in the 18-22 dB range. For all our simulations, we assume to be 10 MHz, and to be 170 dBm/Hz, giving a total noise variance of 100.8 dBm. When we take expectation with respect to different realizations of , we mean taking the ensemble average over the 1000 sample receiver locations. The capacities with and without water filling, and , are computed for different . The results are presented in terms of complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs), the averages and , and capacities at 5% channel outage, and .</p></div>

For an illustration, we consider the case of a two-antenna MEA system. 1000 realizations of the channel matrix are generated using WiSE for different antenna spacing . Using the notations in Section IV, and are determined. The magnitude of and resemble zero-ordered Bessel functions that decay very slowly, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(a)</ref>. At , a strong correlation of exists between path gains originating from different transmitters. The correlation between path gains arriving at different receivers is . The asymmetry is due to the different local scattering environments around the transmitter and receiver.</p><p>In Section IV, we modeled the two-dimensional correlation function in product form. To verify the appropriateness of this approach, we plot the product of and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b), together with the correlation inferred from WiSE simulation results. Close agreement is found consistently between these two curves over the range of we consider. This implies that our assumption of separable transmit/receive correlations in Section IV-B1 is a reasonable first approximation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Capacity of MEA Systems</head><p>In this subsection, we consider square MEAs, which are more compact than linear arrays for a given . The receiver MEA is placed in Room A. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the CCDFs of and for and , assuming and  18 dB. Recall that and are defined as the capacity with optimal water-filling power allocation and with equal-power allocation, respectively. Examining Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we see that as increases, the CCDFs of both and shift to the right, indicating that MEAs yield a capacity gain that increases steadily with . We see that as increases, the horizontal gap between  is low, it is important to allocate the available power to the strongest subchannels, while as increases, there is sufficient power to be distributed over all subchannels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Asymptotic Behavior of MEA Capacities</head><p>In this section, we study the asymptotic behavior of the capacity as grows large. We focus on the high-SNR regime, considering 22 dB. Since for high SNR, we consider only the water-filling capacity here. We consider linear MEAs for two different values of antenna spacing: and . The transmitting MEA is placed either parallel to the long dimension of the hallway (inline case) or perpendicular to it (broadside case). In all cases, the receiving MEA is placed in a random angular orientation in Room A. In this section, we consider the average capacities obtained on simulated channels as opposed to the 5% outage capacity considered in the previous section.</p><p>In order to compute the asymptotic growth rate of capacity assuming independent fading, as derived in Section IV-A, we use simulated channel matrices whose entries are generated by placing individual transmitter and receiver antenna elements at i.i.d. random locations in Room A, instead of placing them in a linear array separated by a fixed distance (e.g., ) as in the regular case. With such an arrangement, the fades between antenna pairs are almost mutually independent. We use these matrices to estimate the variance and the equivalent SNR . We then compute the asymptotic growth rate using <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. To compute the growth rate of capacity including fading correlation, as derived in Section IV-B, we use simulated channel matrices to estimate the variance of (i.e., ), and . In this case, both the transmitting and the receiving MEAs are linear arrays, and individual elements are placed at a fixed spacing of either or apart. Recall that and are eigenvalues of and , respectively. For each case, we generate 1000 random channel matrices and estimate the covariance matrices and as and , respectively. Since the asymptotic growth rate given by ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) is difficult to compute, we can approximate by computing (since at high SNR) as given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. We can approximate and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> with piecewise-linear curves, and replace the integrals with summations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> where 's and 's are eigenvalues of and , respectively. MEA is placed parallel to the x-axis. The receiving MEA is placed in a random orientation at 1000 random locations in Room A. C is the average capacity obtained when the transmit and receive antenna elements lie at i.i.d. locations within their respective workspaces, i.e., they are not constrained to regular linear arrays. nC and nC are asymptotic results for correlated and independent H , respectively.</p><p>We first consider the inline case. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows the average capacity versus for and . For each grows roughly linearly with , from about 5.57 b/s/Hz at to about 79.3 b/s/Hz for and 84.0 b/s/Hz for at . At each is larger for than for , because the larger reduces fading correlation, which was shown in Section IV-B to reduce capacity. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>, we see that the asymptotic growth rate of capacity, assuming independent fading , significantly exceeds the observed average capacities even for . The discrepancy between and grows with increasing . On the other hand, the asymptotic growth rates of capacity including correlation form better upper bounds for than for both values of . are in better agreement with for than , for all values of .</p><p>To further explore the effects of fading correlation, we have computed channel matrices in which the transmitter and receiver antenna elements lie in i.i.d. random locations within their respective workspaces, rather than lying in a regular linear or square array. Thus, the elements of should be more nearly independent than those of . We have used these to compute the average capacity , which is also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. We observe that at each is larger than , and that is nearly as large as , the asymptotic growth rate assuming independent fading. Similar results are obtained for the broadside case, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The average capacity is generally higher than for the inline case for both and . Indeed, in this case lies closer to the asymptotic value than for the inline case. At and , 91.3% for the broadside case, but only 82.4% for the inline case. This suggests that there is less correlation between path gains for the broadside configuration than for the inline configuration. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Average capacity C versus n for the broadside case. We consider linear arrays with two antenna spacings: d = 0:5 and d = 5 . The transmitting MEA is placed parallel to the y-axis. The receiving MEA is placed in a random orientation at 1000 random locations in Room A. C is the average capacity obtained when the transmit and receive antenna elements lie at i.i.d. locations within their respective workspaces, i.e., they are not constrained to regular linear arrays. nC and nC are asymptotic results for correlated and independent H , respectively.</p><p>Our results indicate that fading correlation can significantly reduce MEA system capacity, even for antenna element spacing as large as . Moreover, our results show that the asymptotic growth rate , which considers correlation, provides a good estimate of the observed average capacity . This tends to validate the assumptions under which the formula for was derived in Section IV-B, including the correlation model for the fades between different antenna pairs. If the assumptions in Section IV-B hold, should converge almost surely to (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>) in the limit of large and high SNR. In Figs. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, we illustrate this asymptotic behavior of by plotting the empirical probability density functions (pdfs) of for and , considering 22 dB. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> considers (where there is strong correlation between elements of ), while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8 considers</ref> (where there is less correlation between elements of ). As increases, the pdf becomes narrower and has a higher peak value, i.e., becomes less random. In the limit of large , we expect the pdf of to converge to an impulse function centered at the value . The narrowing pdfs in Figs. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> illustrate the almost-sure convergence of to . Note that when , the pdfs are narrower and taller than when . This indicates that the rate of convergence is higher when is larger, i.e., when the correlation between elements of is lower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>MEA systems offers potentially large capacity gains over single-antenna systems. With perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter, power can be allocated optimally over different transmitting antennas (water filling) to achieve capacity . The water-filling gain is most significant when there are fewer strong eigenmodes, i.e., when the average received Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Empirical pdf of the normalized capacity for n = 4; 9; and 16. We consider linear arrays with antenna elements separated by 0:5 . The reference value is C as predicted by the asymptotic theory considering correlated H . SNR is small. For example, when 10 dB, but at 50 dB, water-filling gain is negligible, . Assuming i.i.d. path gains between different antenna pairs, theoretical analysis shows that the capacity grows linearly with the number of antennas in the limit of large . In a more realistic propagation environment, correlation does exist between antenna pairs and affects the rate of growth of and , although it was shown that they still grow linearly with . The rate of growth of is reduced by correlation over the entire range of SNRs, while that for is reduced by correlation at high SNR but is increased at low SNR. Our simulation results show that for antenna spacing, the simulated average capacity is only 88.5% of the predicted value based on independent fading assumptions, for in the case of broadside with 22 dB. When the antenna spacing is increased to , the effect of correlations on total capacity is smaller: 91.3%. The approximation based on our asymptotic results for correlated fading forms a close upper bound for the average capacity observed on simulated channels at high SNR. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>.
