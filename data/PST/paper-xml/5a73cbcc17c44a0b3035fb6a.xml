<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>IRTUAL Reality (VR) has been used to train professionals in many different domains (e.g., medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, military <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and firefighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) since its early years. More recently, gaming elements have been added to VR training experiences, turning them into serious games that could be more engaging, especially for the general public <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Several studies showed the benefits of VR applications and serious games in training and education (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for two recent meta-analyses). However, more research is needed to understand which characteristics of these applications, in particular VR fidelity, impact on their effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A framework that categorizes the different aspects of VR fidelity is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and identifies three types of VR fidelity. Interaction fidelity is about the realism of the input devices, and the reproduction of realworld interactions in VR. Display fidelity is about the realism of the output devices, and the reproduction of sensory stimuli ("display fidelity" is sometimes referred to as "immersion", but the former term is preferred to avoid ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). Scenario fidelity is about the realism of the simulated scenario, and the reproduction of behaviors, rules, and properties in the simulation.</p><p>The increasing availability of head-mounted displays (HMDs) for home use motivates the study of the possible effects that adopting this new hardware might have on users. In addition, the effects of different types of display have been scarcely explored in the domain of procedural training, i.e. training that deals with the execution of procedures. For these reasons, the study we describe in this paper compares a new HMD for home VR with other types of displays, using them for training in cabin safety procedures with a serious game that simulates a runway overrun accident in VR. We chose cabin safety as a representative case study, since it requires mastering several skills that are relevant also to other procedural training applications. For example, cabin safety requires subjects: i) to memorize complex procedures that consist of several steps; ii) to analyze the environment, people, and other contextual factors that can affect the execution of the procedure; iii) to react to these factors, and update the execution of the procedure accordingly. Cabin safety is also particularly interesting, because passengers tend not to pay attention to current safety briefings (pre-flight safety briefings and safety card) provided by airlines, and even the few passengers who pay attention show an unacceptable level of safety knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This calls for other, more engaging, solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. A study of an immersive serious game that simulated a water landing scenario showed that VR was more engaging than safety cards, and more effective in helping users retain acquired knowledge a week after training <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, that game was played with an HMD with narrow FOV and a 3-DOF tracker, a typical VR setup often used in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The increasing availability of new HMDs with wide FOV and 6-DOF tracking raises the question of whether such higher fidelity displays could be even more effective. Moreover, we wonder whether the immersive display played a role in the positive effects on engagement and knowledge gain found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or a lower-fidelity desktop monitor could achieve the same results. For these reasons, the study in this paper compares: (i) a standard desktop monitor (representative of desktop VR), (ii) an HMD (Sony HMZ-T3W) with narrow field of view (FOV) and a 3-DOF tracker (representative of many setups for immersive VR used in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>), and (iii) an HMD (Oculus Rift DK2) with wide FOV and 6-DOF tracker (representative of new devices for immersive home VR).</p><p>The paper aims at advancing knowledge in different directions. First, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to explore the possible effects of different types of display on safety knowledge acquisition.</p><p>Second, the study explores the effects of the different types of display on additional variables, namely self-efficacy (i.e., the person's belief in his/her ability to perform a specific behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>), self-reported engagement, and selfreported presence (i.e., the sense of being in the virtual environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>). All these variables can play an important role in the acquisition and application of procedural knowledge. Studies in Social Cognitive Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> show that higher self-efficacy has a positive effect on performance. Presence is instead linked with the arousal of emotions, in particular with negative ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In turn, emotional intensity aroused by an experience, and negative emotions in particular, can increase the retention of memory allowing for a better recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Third, unlike previous studies of the effects of different types of display, our study tests knowledge gain and selfefficacy not only immediately after using the serious game, but also two weeks later. This aspect is fundamental since an emergency can occur a long time after training, so effective training should support recall of procedures over time. Since different studies show connections between type of display and presence (see Section 2 and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), between presence and emotions, and between emotions and retention, we hypothesize that the different types of display might play a role in the retention of procedural knowledge over time, and we assess this aspect in the study.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces previous studies of the effects of displays in VR. Section 3 illustrates the training game we employed in the user study. The study is described in Section 4, while its results are reported and discussed in Section 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper outlining future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Several studies addressed the effects of using different displays in VR (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Some of them contrasted different types of display (e.g., desktop monitor vs. HMD, HMD vs CAVE), others considered a single type of display and manipulated its features (e.g., with or without stereoscopy, with original or reduced FOV).</p><p>In many studies, change in display type included a change in interaction too. For example, head rotation is sensed by the system when using a head-tracked HMD, while it has to be controlled by the user (e.g., with a joystick) when using a desktop monitor. Therefore, in terms of the framework proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, all the studies in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> concern changes in display fidelity, and many of them include also changes in interaction fidelity. The table describes in detail the aspects of VR fidelity assessed in each study as well as the considered independent variables, tasks, dependent variables, and main findings. In the following, we briefly summarize the results that are more relevant to our study.</p><p>Effects of different displays were studied especially with visual search tasks, i.e., tasks that require users to search for one or more targets in a virtual environment. For example, Pausch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> found that users wearing an HMD did not find targets faster than stationary monitor users, but were better at determining if a target was present or not. Ragan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> found that wider FOV led to better target detection while users trained in performing a given scanning strategy, but not in an assessment phase performed five minutes after training. Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> showed that a CAVE and an HMD elicited more emotional arousal than a monitor in terms of both self-reported and physiological (skin conductance) measures. Moreover, presence experienced with the CAVE was higher than with the HMD, and presence with the HMD was higher than with the monitor. However, the HMD caused more simulator sickness than the other conditions, and the CAVE caused more simulator sickness than the monitor.</p><p>The fidelity of the display plays an important role also on tasks involving data visualization. For example, Arns et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> showed that an immersive application for statistical visualization in a CAVE led to better identification of data structures than a traditional desktop statistical tool, but also that users were more comfortable with the latter. However, although the immersive application was developed to offer the same functionality of the desktop tool, the two applications were different, and this could have contributed to the result. Bacim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> studied how the combination of display size, stereoscopy, and head tracking in a CAVE affected user performance in understanding mathematical graphs. The study found better overall task performance with the higher fidelity condition. The effects of different components of fidelity, namely head tracking, stereoscopy, and field of regard (FOR) on different tasks concerning volume data visualization were instead studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. FOR is the total size of the visual field surrounding the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, which depends on FOV and on the possibility to rotate the head. The studies found that increased fidelity generally led to better performance in analyzing volume data, and that the influence of the different components varied with the kind of task. The effects of head tracking, stereoscopy, and FOR were studied also on small-scale spatial judgement tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The study found that increased FOR or the addition of head tracking reduced the number of participants' errors, and the combination of stereoscopy and head tracking allowed participants to perform faster.</p><p>In summary, the different studies on visual search tasks, data visualization tasks, and small-scale spatial judgement tasks indicate a positive overall effect of higher fidelity dis- plays on performance, with an influence of the different components that varies based on the particular task.</p><p>Results in the literature are instead less clear for navigation tasks, which combine spatial and visual skills with the cognitive process of building a mental map. For example, Waller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> tested participants' ability to navigate in a real-world maze blindfolded after training in different conditions. They found that a two-minute VR training in a virtual replica of the maze (either using an HMD or a monitor) was no more effective than maps, while a five-minute VR training with an HMD eventually surpassed training in the real world. However, no difference was found between an HMD and a monitor when used for the same amount of time. McNamara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> found no significant differences in navigation performance between a continuous curve screen and a cheaper alternative of the same size made by tiling off-the-shelf screens. Li and Giudice <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> found that display and rotation method did not affect pointing and navigation performance in a multi-level virtual building. Aoki et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> found that users wearing an HMD were significantly faster than those using a monitor when pointing from destination to start location and from start toward a different destination. However, it is important to note that the input device was different, and no significant differences were found for other navigation performance measures. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, CAVE users performed better than monitor users in navigating without motion constraints, but monitor users outperformed CAVE users when motion constraints were enabled. Kober et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> focused instead on sense of presence: a stereo projected screen produced more sense of presence than a monitor in users navigating a virtual maze. Zanbaka et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> studied presence, cognition, and ability to draw a map of a virtual room. While their focus was on navigation methods using different input devices, they also compared three HMD conditions with a monitor condition. All HMD conditions led to higher presence than the monitor, while only the HMD condition with the highest interaction fidelity led to better cognition and drawing. In summary, in navigation tasks, displays with higher fidelity led to an increase in presence, while an increase in performance was found only in some cases (e.g., in absence of motion constrains).</p><p>In recent years, studies concerning displays with different fidelity have been extended to video games. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, users preferred playing games on a 3D stereo monitor rather than the same monitor in 2D mode, but performance in the games was similar. Lugrin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> contrasted a FPS game on a CAVE and on a monitor. Users' subjective preferences were clearly in favor of the CAVE, but performance in the game was better with the monitor, possibly because of a different input mechanism. Display and interaction fidelity in a FPS game were studied independently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>: users tried a CAVE (high display) with a 6-DOF wand (high input), a single screen (low display) with mouse and keyboard (low input), a low display and high input condition, a low input and high display condition. Results showed that performance in the game was better in low display with low input and high display with high input conditions rather than in the two mixed conditions. Subjective scores for presence, engagement, and usability were higher for the high display with high input condition. In summary, the studies concerning games do not show performance gains due to higher fidelity displays, but indicate that users tend to prefer higher fidelity displays to play games.</p><p>Finally, focusing on studies that assessed knowledge gain using different types of display, Limniou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> found that 3D animations in a CAVE are better than 2D animations on a desktop PC with a projector to understand molecule structure and chemical reactions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, a 15-minute seminar was provided to different groups of users under four conditions: real classroom, 3D desktop, 3D HMD, and audio only. Authors found that only the real classroom was able to obtain presence results that were significantly higher than the other conditions. Moreover, reported presence was not associated with memory recall. Conversely, greater presence was reported as a predictor of better learning in a study that compared an HMD and a desktop monitor to understand water movement and salinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The higher fidelity display was more effective, but the result was found only for water movement. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, an HMD was compared with a large-screen projection display for training in communication skills with two virtual patients. Authors found that users' self-ratings of empathy were higher with the HMD, but users of the large-screen projection display were able to reflect more accurately on their use of empathy. Fassbender et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> studied the effects of two types of display combined with background music for studying a virtual history lesson. The authors found that users remembered a higher number of facts using a 3-monitor setting rather than using a larger curved screen, but they also found an interaction between display and background music.</p><p>Only a few studies considered the effects of different types of displays on procedural knowledge acquisition. Sowndararajan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> tested the effects of using a typical laptop display and a large L-shaped two-screen projection display to memorize a simple and a complex procedure that consisted in moving objects among different spatial locations (e.g., "pick up the purple bottle" in a particular place, use it on a virtual character, and put it back). They found that users who tried the highest fidelity display performed the complex procedure faster and with less mistakes, while no difference was found for the simple procedure. A follow up study by Ragan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> used a CAVE to test independently the effects of different display fidelity components on the memorization of spatial procedures concerning the movement of objects with different forms and colors. They found that matched software FOV (i.e., the FOV set by the software was the same of the hardware), high FOV, and high FOR all contributed to memorization. They also showed that the training could be transferred from the virtual environment to the real world, by asking users to reproduce the procedure on physical objects.</p><p>In summary, no clear effect emerged from the different studies that concerned knowledge: further research is needed to understand the conditions under which different types of display could have an effect on presence and knowledge gain. In particular, the few studies concerning procedural knowledge indicated that using higher fidelity displays improves learning of spatial procedures, but, to the best of our knowledge, no study tested the effects of different displays on procedural training scenarios different from the movement of objects among different spatial locations. Another aspect that was not investigated in the literature concerns display effects on knowledge retention. The reported studies assessed knowledge gain immediately after using the displays, but did not assess if such knowledge was maintained over a longer time span.</p><p>Overall, current studies show that higher fidelity displays could increase presence, be preferred by users, and improve performance, but such effects greatly vary with the nature of the task. Our study aims to advance research on display effects in VR by assessing if, and which of, these effects apply to the largely unexplored domain of procedural training, considering procedures that are different from moving objects among spatial locations. Moreover, unlike previous studies, we extend our attention to a period of two weeks after the training to assess knowledge retention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE CONSIDERED SERIOUS GAME</head><p>The serious game we used to test the effects of the different types of display allows players to experience a full emergency evacuation of a commercial twin-aisle, narrow-body aircraft after a runway overrun. The scenario is partially inspired by the real accident that occurred to Air France Flight 358 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, which crashed into a field near Toronto International Airport after overshooting the runway because of inclement weather. The evacuation of the aircraft was made more complex by fire, which also made some exits unusable. The serious game vividly displays the consequences of players' errors in such scenario. In the following, we present in detail the plot of the game and the effects of players' actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Game Plot and Players' Actions</head><p>The game plot begins on-board the aircraft approaching the destination airport, twenty seconds before the captain announces very bad weather conditions, and ends when the player succeeds in reaching a safe place, after the aircraft overruns the runway and crashes in a nearby field. If players choose correct actions, they progress in the evacuation of the aircraft; if they choose wrong actions or omit right ones, they trigger negative feedback and recommendations about proper behavior. In particular, if the error is irreversible in the real world (e.g., jumping from wings instead of using the slides, or not keeping the brace position during impact), the game shows the negative consequences of the error, and pauses while a brief textual recommendation is displayed for 7 seconds. Then, it restarts from where the player took the wrong decision. On the contrary, if the error is reversible in the real world (e.g., taking luggage or trying to go towards an exit that is not the closest one), then the game does not stop, and nearby characters (passengers or flight attendants) give verbally the recommendation to the player. However, if the player ignores the verbal recommendation, and persists in the error (e.g., keeps luggage or keeps going in the wrong direction), then the game treats the error in the same way as irreversible ones.</p><p>In detail, the game plot develops following this sequence of steps:</p><p>1. The player is on a seat near the left aisle, two seat rows from the closest exit. The aircraft is flying normally, and passengers look calm. The player can hear normal engine sounds, and people chattering. 2. The captain announces that the aircraft is approaching the destination airport. He warns passengers that the weather is bad and can cause turbulence, asking them to fasten their seat belts. If players do not fasten seat belts within a few seconds, turbulence throws their avatar against the forward seat.</p><p>The avatar hits the seat with the head, blood spatters on the view, and the player has to repeat step 2. 3. The aircraft is on the runway, but does not touch down. The captain realizes that the aircraft will overrun the runway, and asks passengers to prepare for an emergency by assuming the brace position (Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Flight attendants keep shouting "Brace!" until the aircraft crashes on a field. If the player does not assume and keep the brace position until the aircraft comes to a complete stop, his/her avatar gets injured (as in step 2), and (s)he has to repeat step 3. 4. After the impact, some passengers are lightly injured, and have bloodstains on their faces (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). The crew orders evacuation, and the player can choose among different actions: unfasten seat belts, take the life vest, and stand up. If the player tries to take the life vest, the nearby passenger tells him/her not to waste time with it, because the aircraft is not on water. If the player persists in wasting time on the seat, then (s)he hears an explosion, is reached by fire, and has to repeat step 4. 5. After the player stands up, (s)he can reach the aisle and possibly take his/her luggage. If the player takes the luggage, avatar movement becomes slow, and other passengers complain about the slowdown of the evacuation, telling the player to drop luggage. If the player does not drop it within a few seconds, then the error becomes irreversible, and the game restarts from the instant before luggage was taken. 6. The player can move towards an exit. If (s)he goes in the direction of the farther exits, a passenger blocks the way (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>) telling the player to go towards the closest exit. If the player persists in the wrong way, (s)he loses time, is reached by fire, and has to repeat step 6. 7. When the player approaches the closest exit, an explosion causes fire and smoke to propagate rapidly from the rear of the aircraft (Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). The flight attendant who assists passengers at that exit orders everyone to go towards the front of the aircraft because fire is coming. The player has to reach an exit on the wings (the closest usable one), while smoke continues to propagate towards the front. If the player does not choose the "bend down" action, and keeps standing in smoke for more than 5 seconds, the avatar starts coughing, and loses consciousness. Then, the game restarts from the instant before coughing. If the player moves too slowly, fire reaches his/her avatar (Figure <ref type="figure">1D</ref>), and the game restarts from 7 seconds before fire reached the player. 8. When the player reaches a wing exit, the flight attendant near the exit tells him/her to exit on the wing, reach the slide, and jump down (Figure <ref type="figure">1E</ref>). If the player hesitates or tries to go towards the front, the flight attendant shouts to order him/her to use that exit. If the player does not comply within a few seconds, the avatar is reached by fire and the player has to repeat step 8. 9. When the player leaves the cabin and is on a wing, (s)he can move towards the wing slide and jump down. If (s)he tries instead to jump down directly from the without using the slide, the avatar gets injured in the fall (Figure <ref type="figure">1F</ref>). Moreover, if the player wastes time on the wing before using the slide, an explosion injures the avatar. In both cases, the player has to repeat step 9. 10. When the player reaches the ground through the slide, (s)he can freely move around the aircraft. However, if (s)he remains close to the burning aircraft, an explosion eventually injures the avatar (as in step 9), and the player has to repeat step 10. The evacuation completes successfully when the player reaches a safe distance from the aircraft.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Interaction with the Game</head><p>Players interact with the game using an Xbox 360 controller (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). To move in the direction they are currently facing (resp. in the opposite direction), players push the left joystick forward (resp. backward). Left and right movement of the left joystick changes one's place when one is in a seat row. To rotate the avatar, players move the right joystick in the left or right direction. When the display is a desktop monitor, the right joystick can be moved backward/forward to rotate the head of the avatar up and down (in the HMD conditions, this rotation is instead controlled by head tracking). Actions described in the previous section (e.g., fastening seat belts, assuming brace position, and so on) are carried out by selecting semitransparent icons superimposed on the scene (see examples in Figure <ref type="figure">1A, B, C,</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). Each time the player has to take an action, between one and three icons appear. Such icons refer to actions that can be taken in the real world at the current location. However, as seen in the previous section, not all actions one can take are appropriate for the emergency scenario, e.g. taking luggage after standing up from the seat. Players select icons using left and right arrows on the D-pad control. The currently selected icon is highlighted on the display by changing its: (i) distance from user's eyes (it becomes slightly closer), (ii) its background (fully opaque), and (iii) its brightness (higher). Players can perform the selected action by pressing the "A" button on the controller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">USER EVALUATION</head><p>To evaluate the effects of the type of display, we carried out a between-groups study. In the following, we will refer to the group of participants who played the game on the desktop monitor as Low Fidelity (LF) group, those who This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication. Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TVCG.2017.2653117, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics used the HMD with narrow FOV and 3-DOF tracker as Medium Fidelity (MF) group, and those who used the HMD with wide FOV and 6-DOF tracker as High Fidelity (HF) group. It is important to remark that, in the group names, "fidelity" refers to display fidelity, but also to interaction fidelity, since the MF and HF conditions used head tracking (with 3DOF and 6 DOF, respectively) and LF used the joystick for head rotation. The other aspects of interaction fidelity as well as scenario fidelity were the same for all groups.</p><p>We formulated four hypothesis for the study. First, we hypothesized that all groups should show a knowledge gain immediately after use, since all participants were exposed to exactly the same scenario, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> we found that playing a cabin safety scenario produced a knowledge gain. Second, since gaining experience in performing a given behavior is a major factor that contributes to increase self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we hypothesized that being able to complete the serious game by successfully evacuating from the aircraft should increase user's self-efficacy immediately after use in all groups. Third, the display should instead play a role in how the scenario is experienced, affecting self-reported engagement (as suggested by previous studies concerning games <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>), and self-reported presence (as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>). In particular, these measures should return higher values as fidelity increases. Fourth, if the previous hypothesis holds, higher fidelity could also result in more knowledge retention, since presence is linked with emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and emotions have a positive effect on memory retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Materials</head><p>The serious game was implemented using the Unity 4.6 game engine, and run on a PC equipped with a 3.60 GHz Intel i7-4790 processor, 16 GB RAM, and an NVidia GTX 970 graphic card. The monitor used by the LF group was an Asus VX279H 27" display with 1920x1080 resolution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). The Sony HMD used by the MF group had two OLED displays with 1280x720 resolution each and 45° FOV), and the 3-DOF sensor was an InterSense Iner-tiaCube3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). The Oculus HMD used by the HF group had an OLED display with 1920x1080 resolution, 100° FOV, and its own 6-DOF tracker (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).

Answers ranged from 1 to 7 (median=4; 15 users never played video games, 15 played less than once a month, 11 played about once a month, 26 played several times a month, 16 played several times a week, and 13 played every day).</p><p>We also assessed individual differences in frequency of air travel by asking participants to count their number of flights in the last two years, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.

Answers were audio recorded and later rated by the experimenter as correct or wrong, following a codebook that listed the possible answers and their rating (right/wrong).

Mean pre-test knowledge score showed that participants were initially able to answer correctly only about half of the questions (M=4.56, SD=1.94). One-way ANOVA showed no significant differences in initial knowledge between the three groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Self-Efficacy</head><p>To measure self-efficacy, we used a questionnaire with six items: 1) I feel able to deal with an emergency evacuation of an aircraft; 2) I would be able to deal with an emergency evacuation even if the aircraft is on fire; 3) I would be able to deal with an emergency evacuation even if one or more exits are blocked; 4) I would be able to deal with an emergency evacuation even if most of the passengers scream or cry; 5) I feel confident of my ability to exit from the aircraft in time; 6) I would be able to help passengers in need. The questionnaire was designed by adapting items from wellknown self-efficacy questionnaires (General Self-Efficacy scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>) to our domain, and following the recommendations on rigorous theory-based semantic structure for specific behaviors proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Each item was rated by participants on a 7-point scale (1=not at all, 7=very). We administered the self-efficacy questionnaire three times (pre-test, post-test, and retention-test). Answers were averaged to form a reliable scale (Cronbach's alpha pre-test=0.92, post-test=0.94, retention-test=0.92). Mean pretest self-efficacy was only 2.91 (SD=1.23).

The six items were: "It was boring", "It was engaging", "It aroused emotions in me", "The depicted situation looked real", "I forgot the passing of time", "I felt immersed in the depicted situation". After inverting the scale of the first item, the six ratings were averaged to form a reliable scale (Cronbach's al-pha=0.87).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4">Self-Reported Presence</head><p>To measure the sense of presence experienced by participants while playing the game, we administered the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The IPQ is a 14-item self-report scale (available at http://www.igroup.org/ pq/ipq/index.php), comprising a general item related to the sense of "being there", and three subscales that evaluate three independent dimensions of the VR experience: spatial presence (5 items), involvement (4 items) and experienced realism (4 items). Participants have to rate their degree of agreement with IPQ statements on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 6.</p></div>

Written consent for participation and for recording verbal answers to the knowledge test was obtained from participants. They were also informed that they were going to be contacted again two weeks later for an additional questionnaire (without specifying what those further questions were going to concern), and that they could refrain from continuing the experiment at any time, without providing a reason to the experimenter. Then, participants filled an initial demographic questionnaire (gender, age, frequency of game use, and frequency of air travel), verbally answered the knowledge questions, and filled the FAS and the self-efficacy questionnaires.</p><p>The experimenter gave participants the game controller, and invited them to memorize the position of the controls highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. This was particularly important for the MF and HF groups, since those participants were not going to be able to see the controller while wearing the HMD. The experimenter helped participants of the MF and HF groups to adjust the HMD until they could see well and feel comfortable with it. Then, for all three groups, the experimenter explained the controls while participants were playing an initial tutorial level, in which they boarded the aircraft and moved in the cabin to reach their seat. When they were close to the seat, they had to perform the following sequence of actions: put their luggage in the overhead bin, sidestep in their seat row to reach the assigned seat, sit down, and fasten seat belts. In this way, participants could familiarize with all game controls needed to play the runway overrun scenario. Then, participants wore the closed earphones, and tried the runway overrun scenario.</p><p>After the experimental condition, participants filled the presence, engagement, and self-efficacy questionnaires. Then, they verbally answered the knowledge questions. Two weeks later, the experimenter contacted participants to assess again knowledge and self-efficacy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>The results confirmed most of our hypotheses. First, the statistical analysis highlighted a significant gain in knowledge between pre-test and post-test. This is consistent with evidence provided by other studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>) about the effectiveness of serious games for learning safety procedures. However, our study considered three displays with different fidelity, and showed that the serious game significantly increased participants' safety knowledge regardless of the display used to play it. It is worth to add that the type of display had no significant effect on playing time: one-way ANOVA showed no significant differences in the amount of time participants spent to complete the scenario (LF: M=258.9 s, SD=104.5; MF: M=266.3 s, SD=106.6; HF: M=237.0 s, SD=66.8), so all participants were exposed to the same safety materials for a similar amount of time. The fact that the HF condition was no better than the two lower fidelity conditions in terms of knowledge gain may seem in contrast with the findings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, which instead showed a positive effect of higher display fidelity on memorization of complex procedures. However, it is important to note that those previous studies concerned memorization of procedures that consisted in moving objects among different spatial locations. Therefore, as discussed in both <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, the displays with higher fidelity could better present spatial cues, allowing users to exploit a spatial memory strategy (similar to the "method of loci" <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>) for memorizing the procedure. Our study, instead, explored the effects of display type on safety procedures that are different from moving objects among different spatial locations. The questions asked in the knowledge test were not focused on assessing spatial abilities, but on the learning of cabin safety procedures. The identification of relations between events (e.g., the presence of smoke) and actions to perform (e.g., bending down), as well as relations between performed or omitted actions (e.g., not bending down) and avatar damage (e.g., coughing and losing consciousness), had thus a more prominent role than the acquisition of accurate spatial information. Therefore, scenario fidelity could have played a more important role than display fidelity in learning the procedures.</p><p>The results confirmed our hypothesis on self-efficacy, which significantly increased between pre-test and post-test in all three groups. After using the game, participants were more confident in their ability to deal with an emergency evacuation of an aircraft. As expected, there was no effect of display type on post-test self-efficacy, since a major factor that contributes to increase self-efficacy is gaining experience in performing the given behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and participants in all the three groups successfully tried the same scenario.</p><p>Display type played instead a role in self-reported engagement and presence. As hypothesized, higher fidelity resulted in higher engagement and higher presence, but the result did not reach statistical significance for all comparisons between displays. More precisely, we found that playing the serious game using the wider FOV HMD with the 6-DOF tracker was significantly more engaging than playing it on the monitor. Mean engagement was also higher using the higher fidelity HMD rather than the narrower FOV HMD with the 3-DOF tracker, but the difference between them did not reach significance. Interestingly, the narrower FOV HMD was not able to produce a significant difference with respect to the monitor. These results advance knowledge about the effects of display type on games: while previous studies compared only two displays, and showed that players' preference went to the higher fidelity display <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, our study compared three types of display, and indicated that only the highest fidelity HMD (wider FOV and 6-DOF head tracking) led to a significant increase in self-reported engagement with respect to the monitor. Participants' feedback elicited by means of short interviews helped us understand this finding: 13 participants in the HF group mentioned immersion aspects (which could be due to both wider FOV and 6-DOF tracking) as one of the features of the experience they liked the most, while four participants in the MF group complained about the display they used. In particular, two of them mentioned that they felt as if a "movie theater" screen was in front of them: the narrow FOV of the HMD might have reduced immersion and engagement, making it similar to a desktop monitor.</p><p>Participants' feedback was consistent with the results we found for presence. There was a statistically significant difference only between the HF group (highest presence scores) and the LF group (lowest presence scores) for the total score and the spatial subscale, and also a difference between HF and MF for the general item about the sense of "being there". The means of the other two subscales (involvement and realism) differed in the same way, but no statistical significance was found. Overall, results confirm previous studies about the positive effects of higher fidelity displays on presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and extend the findings to the domain of procedural training. Moreover, while those studies compared six-screen CAVE vs. single screen <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, desktop vs.  HMD vs. CAVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, desktop vs. single stereo projected screen <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, or desktop vs. HMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, we compared desktop vs. two different types of HMDs and found that the two types of HMDs led to different presence scores. Moreover, we found that the wider FOV HMD with the 6-DOF tracker significantly increased presence with respect to the monitor, while the narrower FOV HMD with the 3-DOF tracker did not. This can be due to both the wider FOV and the 6-DOF tracker. Indeed, the wider FOV HMD allows expanding the peripheral view and likely reduces the possibility that users notice the case that holds the LCD panel. On the contrary, users of the narrower FOV HMD can easily notice the black borders around the LCD panel and feel as if a "movie theater" screen was in front of them. This has likely an impact on the sense of "being there" as well as on the ratings of some items in the spatial subscale of IPQ, such as "I felt like I was just perceiving pictures". At the same time, head tracking can also affect the sense of "being there" and spatial presence. The 6-DOF tracker can reproduce the effect of fully moving the head in the virtual environment. On the contrary, the translation of the head with the 3-DOF tracker can be perceived as "moving the environment" instead of moving inside the environment, because the camera position is not updated and thus the environment has no relative movement with respect to user's head. Further studies can separately address FOV and head tracking to understand how much each of the two affects presence. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the new devices for home VR, such as the Oculus Rift, can enable virtual experiences where users can feel a sense of presence that is significantly higher than the past. This fosters future research work to investigate the exploitation of the new devices for procedural training not limited to the safety domain. Our findings also suggest the need to extend work that studied the effects of with narrow FOV and/or a 3-DOF tracker (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>). In particular, the outcomes of studies that compared presence with such HMDs and other displays (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>) might change using new, wider FOV HMDs with a 6-DOF tracker. Finally, our study extended previous work by considering the effect of display type on the different aspects of presence. On one hand, we found a clear positive effect of high fidelity on the sense of "being there", spatial presence, and overall sense of presence. On the other hand, such positive effect was not so evident for the involvement and realism subscales, suggesting that these measures might be more influenced by other aspects of fidelity that were kept constant for all groups in our study. The notion of involvement assessed by the IPQ was defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> as "a psychological state experienced as a consequence of focusing one's energy and attention on a coherent set of stimuli or meaningfully related activities and events". Therefore, the generally positive scores for involvement could have been affected by the fidelity of the scenario, which presented a coherent sequence of events and required users to perform meaningfully related actions to deal with them.</p><p>The hypothesis about the effect of display type on knowledge retention was not met. The knowledge gained using the serious game was retained two weeks later regardless of display type. This was not expected, since presence was affected by the display used, and presence is linked with emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which have an impact on memory retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Other aspects of the VR experience might have had a larger impact than presence on emotion and retention. For example, the surprising events in the game plot and the vivid depiction of the effects of player errors could have elicited negative emotions (which contribute to memory consolidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>) in all participants, including those who used lower fidelity displays and reported lower levels of presence. Unlike our previous work on knowledge retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which assessed retention of safety procedures after 1 week, the present study considered a longer time span, showing that knowledge was retained even after 2 weeks.</p><p>Similarly, there was no effect of type of display on self-efficacy assessed after 2 weeks, and self-efficacy significantly increased also between post-test and retention-test in all groups. The fact that all participants succeeded in the evacuation and were successful at remembering over time how they did it might have contributed to the further increase in self-efficacy.</p><p>In summary, we found that changing the type of display affected users' engagement and sense of presence, while it did not significantly affect the increase in knowledge and self-efficacy obtained by playing the serious game. Although this result suggests that using desktop VR setups could be sufficient for procedural safety training, it must be noted that our participants spent a similar amount of time in the game, and none of them had the possibility to try it again between posttest and retention-test. On the contrary, in non-experimental settings, the availability of high-fidelity VR displays that -as we have seen -produce more engagement and presence could make users more likely to play the game again, refreshing and reinforcing the knowledge acquired as well as acquiring more knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we studied the effects of different types of display in a VR-based procedural training scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the topic on safety procedures, and we found that changing the type of display affected users' engagement and sense of presence, while it did not significantly affect the increase in knowledge and self-efficacy. Analysis of the different aspects of presence found that overall presence, spatial presence, and the sense of "being there" were highest using the highest fidelity display, while no significant differences were found on the involvement and realism aspects of presence. It is worth noting that only the highest fidelity HMD led to significantly higher engagement and presence with respect to the monitor. Finally, our study was the first to explore the effects of different types of display at two weeks after the experimental condition, and showed that the acquired benefits in terms of knowledge and self-efficacy were retained, regardless of the display used.</p><p>Further research is needed to investigate the role of interaction fidelity. While this study investigated the overall effects of three typical VR display setups, we plan to carry out a study that will focus on the highest fidelity display, and assesses its effects with 3-DOF vs. 6-DOF head tracking enabled. This will allow us to explore how much of the presence and engagement results could possibly be due to the head tracking component.</p><p>We should also consider that different input devices for home VR are going to reach the market (e.g., Oculus Touch, Virtuix Omni,…), so it would be interesting to test the effects of further increases in interaction fidelity. In particular, using the same high fidelity display, we plan to compare the use of a joystick vs. hand tracking for activating actions, assessing if higher interaction fidelity will result in higher presence and engagement. Finally, it will be interesting to study if higher interaction fidelity could have a positive effect on procedural knowledge gain and retention, especially for procedures that require to perform physical actions.</p><p>Fabio Buttussi received his PhD in computer science from the University of Udine.
