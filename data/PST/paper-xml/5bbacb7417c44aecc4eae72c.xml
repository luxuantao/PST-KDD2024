			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Due to the expanding system scale and increasing operational complexity, the cascade hydropower reservoir operation balancing benefit and firm output is becoming one of the most important problems in China's hydropower system. To handle this problem, this paper presents a parallel multi-objective particle swarm optimization where the swarm with large population size is divided into several smaller subswarms to be simultaneously optimized by different worker threads. In each subtask, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization is adopted to finish the entire evolutionary process, where the leader particles, external archive set and computational parameters are all dynamically updated. Besides, a novel constraint handling strategy is used to identify the feasible search space while the domination strategy based on constraint violation is used to enhance the convergence speed of swarm. The presented method is applied to Lancang cascade hydropower system in southwest China. The results show that PMOPSO can provide satisfying scheduling results in different cases. For the variation coefficient of generation in 30 independent runs, the presented method can bettered the serial algorithm with about 66.67% and 61.29% reductions in normal and dry years, respectively. Hence, this paper provides an effective tool for multi-objective operation of cascade hydropower system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>As one of the most significant renewable and clean sources öf energy, hydropower has been experiencing a rapid development period throughout the world in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. China has abundant hydropower resources with a technical exploitation amount of about 400 G W <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. To satisfy the huge energy demand caused by the booming economic development of China, a large number of hydroplants have been placed in service while many more are being under construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. By the end of 2015, the total installed capacity of hydropower in China has reached up to about 320 G W, while the gross generation of hydropower exceeds 1.0 trillion kilowatt hours. Nowadays, China is entering a new era of large-scale hydropower system composed of numerous hydropower bases equipped with giant hydroplants and generating units <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Hence, due to the unprecedented system scale, the cascade hydropower reservoirs operation (CHRO) is becoming one of the most important and challenging tasks for China's power system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Generally, the main goal of hydropower system operated by a central dispatching authority is to determine the optimal operation process of all hydroplants that can maximize the total generation benefit of system in the scheduling horizon <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, while satisfying a group of complex equality and inequality constraints, like water balance equations and output limits <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. However, due to the limited water resources, the results obtained by conventional benefit maximization model tend to store more water so as to raise the water levels and hydraulic heads of hydropower system. This mode will help the system operate at high efficiency zones as long as possible, but inevitably lead to the risk that there is no enough water for energy supply in some periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. To achieve a compromise between economy and reliability, the operation model that simultaneously considers energy production and firm output is becoming increasingly popular in the cascaded hydropower system of China <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Thus, to meet the actual demand of the CHRO problem, the multi-objective model balancing generation benefit and firm output is chosen as the focus of this paper.</p><p>Mathematically, the CHRO problem balancing generation benefit and firm output is classified as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). To solve the MOOP problem, many effective algorithms have been successfully developed by researchers around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and these techniques can be broadly divided into two different groups: single-objective optimization and multiobjective optimization. In the first category, some conversion tricks (like weighting method, constraint method and penalty factor) are firstly adopted to transform the multi-objective problem into a single-objective optimization problem, and then some classical mathematical methods (like linear programming and dynamic programming) are employed to resolve it <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. For instance, In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the weighting coefficient is incorporated into linear programming to allocate the quarter-hourly generation of hydro-thermal-nuclear plants among multiple power grids; Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. proposes a multi-objective ecological reservoir operation model combining the merits of statistical water quality models, multi-objective reservoir operations and a self-adaptive genetic algorithm; based on differential evolution and utility function; Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. proposes a multi-objective best compromise decision model for multi-objective real-time flood operations in multiple reservoir system; Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. proposes a novel search method fusing a feasible search space into the particle swarm optimization for multi-objective cascade reservoir optimization. Although the first group can effectively reduce the optimization difficulty in most cases, it is often affected by the artificial conversion coefficients and cannot provide enough information on the optimal tradeoff front <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In the second group, all the objectives are often simultaneously addressed by multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, such as multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), multi-objective differential evolution and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II).</p><p>MOEAs have no strict requirements on the mathematical properties of optimization problems and can generate a group of non-dominated solutions in a single run, which has attracted a great of attention from scholars. For instance, Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. presents a multi-objective particle swarm optimization to handle hydropower system operation considering the maximization of gross generation and firm output; Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. uses a cascade reservoir input variable selection strategy to choose the most valuable input variables for decision-making in multiple-objectivity cascade reservoir operation; Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. uses MOEAs to derive operating rules for pumped water storage with the objectives of minimizing the water shortage index and maximizing the net revenues of consumed and produced energy; Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. uses a multi-objective reservoir optimal operation model to discuss the individual and joint effects of operation factors on the trade-off between flood control and water conservation. However, due to the loss of swarm diversity, it is difficult for MOEAs to avoid the premature convergence problem in many cases, which often produces dissatisfactory nondominated set. In addition, the computational cost of MOEAs often increases sharply or even become intolerable with the expansion of problem scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Thus, some certain spaces to enhance the performance of MOEAs still exist in practice. Generally, the possible feasible ways include the improvement of search mechanism, exploration of new search strategies or utilization of efficient computing technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Here, the parallel computing technique is chosen to improve the search capacity of MOEAs.</p><p>With the rapid development of computer technology, the multicore processor has become the standard configuration of personal computers, workstation and servers, providing the necessary hardware foundation for parallel computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In addition, many famous parallel frameworks represented by Fork/Join and MPI (message passing interface) have been developed by different organizations and companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, providing indispensable software basis for the implementation of parallel computing. Hence, in many scientific and engineering fields, the parallelization design has become a popular tool to reduce the execution time of traditional tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. For instance, Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. develops a parallel multi-swarm algorithm based on comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization for global numerical optimization problems; Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. develops a parallelized version of genetic algorithm for the optimal distribution of shopping centers; Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. uses parallel technique and progressive optimality algorithm to handle the peak operation problem of hydropower system; Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. verifies the feasibility of parallel computing in stochastic dynamic programming for long term operation planning of hydrothermal power systems. However, for the best of our knowledge, even to this day, there are still a few open reports about using the parallel technique to improve the computational efficiency of algorithms for cascade hydropower reservoir operation balancing benefit and firm output. Hence, for the purpose of enriching the existing optimization techniques, this paper aims at incorporating the advanced parallel technology into MOEAs for the hydropower operation problem.</p><p>Compared with other heuristic approaches, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) was found slow at the beginning, but will become effective when approaching to a higher model run iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, which can effectively guarantee its global search capability. With the advantages of fewer computing parameters, higher execution efficiency and less computational burden, PSO has been widely adopted to address many complex engineering optimization problems. Moreover, the PSO method encoded in Java language has been successfully developed in our previous literatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, which will greatly promotes research progress. Thus, PSO was chosen as the standard method for parallelization, and the parallel multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PMOPSO) based on the Fork/Join framework is introduced to solve the complicated CHRO problem. The feasibility of PMOPSO was demonstrated by the simulations of Lancang hydropower system in several cases with dry, wet and real runoff. To be mentioned, for a given region, the dry years means that the runoff in the target hydrologic year is less than its average annual runoff, and the drought years denote a long period of below-average precipitation. Both of the drought years and dry years will lead to water resources shortages and harm to the local economy, ecosystem as well as agriculture.</p><p>Finally, to better understand this paper, the key points are summarized as below: (1) a practical model balancing power generation and firm output of hydropower system is presented; (2) based on the principles of MOPSO, small population and parallel computing, PMOPSO is proposed to diversify the population and reduce the execution time of MOPSO, which is the main contribution of this study to the field of optimization studies; (3) Based on the strict theoretical derivation, a novel constraint handling technique is used to ensure the feasibility of particles; (4) the proposed approach can obtain satisfactory results when applied to the optimal operation of Lancang cascade hydropower system in China.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as below. Section 2 gives the mathematical model of CHRO. The basic information of PMOPSO is introduced in Section 3. Then, Section 4 shows the details of PMOPSO for the CHRO problem.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Brief introduction of multi-objective optimization problem</head><p>In general, many real-world optimization problems with two or more conflictive objectives can be treated as multi-objective optimization problems. In MOOP, no one solution is better than any other solutions with respect to all the objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Thus, MOOP aims at finding out the Pareto optimal solutions consisting of compromise solutions for numerous objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Without loss of generality, the MOOP in this paper can be described as below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">max F (X) = f 1 (X) , f 2 (X) , • • •, f N O (X) s.t. ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ g m (X) ≤ 0, m ∈ 1, N g h n (X) = 0, n ∈ [1, N h ] X = X 1 , X 2 , • • •, X N d ∈ R N d (13)</formula><p>Where N O is the number of objectives. N d is the number of variables. X and F are the decision vector and objective vector, respectively. g m (X) is the m th inequality constraint. h n (X) is the n th equality constraint. N h and N g are the number of equality and inequality constraints, respectively.</p><p>In MOOP, the possible relationships for two solutions are as below: none dominates the other solution or one is dominated by the other. For the maximization problem, when the condition in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) holds, solution X 1 is said to dominate solution X 2 and it can be denoted as X 1 ≺ X 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Then X 1 and X 2 are called non-dominated and inferior solutions, respectively; otherwise, X 1 does not dominate X 2 as Eq. ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) is violated. All the non-dominated solutions formed the Pareto optimal solution set, and their objective values are known as the Pareto optimal front <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">{ ∀ i = 1, 2, • • •, N O : f i (X 1 ) ≥ f i (X 2 ) ∃ i = 1, 2, • • •, N O : f i (X 1 ) &gt; f i (X 2 ) (14)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Overview of particle swarm optimization</head><p>Inspired by the social behaviors of bird groups in nature, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a famous population-based evolutionary approach. Due to its feasibility and effectiveness, PSO has been widely used to address complex, nonlinear and nondifferential constrained optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. In PSO, each particle is considered as a potential solution of the optimization problem, and a set of candidate particles continue to search for the optimal solution in the problem space <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Each particle has two important indicators: position vector representing the possible solution and velocity vector representing the possible moving direction. The swarm will repeat the iteration process until the preset terminal condition is reached. In the evolutionary process, each particle uses Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">15</ref>) to dynamically adjust its position and velocity vectors by following its own personal best position (PBest) and the global best position (GBest) of population.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">V c+1 i = c • V c i + a c 1 • r 1 • PBest c i -X c i + a c 2 • r 2 • GBest c -X c i X c+1 i =X c i + V c+1 i , i ∈ [1, I] , c ∈ 1, c max (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>Where I is the number of particles. c max is the maximum iteration.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">X c i ∈ R N d and V c i ∈ R N d</formula><p>are the position and velocity vectors of the ith particle at the cth iteration, respectively. r 1 and r 2 are two random numbers distributed uniformly in the range of [0,1]. c is the inertia factor at the cth iteration, which is used to control the influence of previous velocity on the current velocity. a c 1 and a c 2 are the cognitive and social learning factors in the cth cycle, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO)</head><p>This section gives the details of MOPSO for solving MOOP, including the dynamic updating of leader particles and archive set, self-adaptive adjustment parameters and mutation operator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Update of personal best positions</head><p>The personal best position denotes the optimal solutions found by the particle itself by far. For each particle, once its personal best position in memory is dominated by the current position, it will be replaced by the current position; otherwise, nothing needs to be done. Then, the personal best positions can be updated by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">PBest c i = PBest c-1 i , if PBest c-1 i ≺ X c i X c i otherwise<label>(16)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Update of global best positions</head><p>The global best position denotes the best solution found by all the particles by far. Different from single-objective optimization problems, it is difficult or even impossible to choose a global optimal solution due to the inherent conflicting nature of MOOP. Inspired by other MOEAs, an external archive set with fixed size is introduced to maintain non-dominated solutions obtained by particles. At each loop, the crowding distance of particles in external archive set will be calculated to evaluate the diversity, and then the binary tournament is used to select a global optimal position for each individual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3.">Update of external archive set</head><p>As mentioned above, the external archive set plays an important role in the selection of global best position. At each iteration, to avoid the omission of good solutions and keep the size of elite archive set unchanged, these particles in elite archive set should be updated dynamically based on the following rules: 1 if there is no solutions in the elite archive set, add the new solution into it directly; 2 if the new solution is dominated by some solutions in the elite archive set, abandon it; otherwise, add the new solution into the elite archive set and remove those solutions dominated by it from the elite archive set; 3 if the size of the elite archive set exceeds the maximum capacity, abandon those individuals with poor performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4.">Update of computational parameters</head><p>In PSO, for the inertia weight c , the higher value can increase the global searching ability of swarm in the search space, while the lower value can improve the neighborhood search ability of particle <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Fork/Join parallel framework</head><p>As a famous framework for parallel computing, Fork/Join uses the divide-and-conquer strategy to recursively divide the complex problem into several subtasks with smaller computational scale, and then merges the results of all subtasks to obtain the final solution. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the schematic of the divide-and-conquer strategy. In Fork/Join, the threshold is a key parameter to control the scale of subtasks. During the implementation of Fork/Join, if the size of the split subtasks is less than the predefined threshold, the decomposition process will be stopped and the existing simple methods are used to solve those subtasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Obviously, the performances of parallel algorithms are affected by the threshold: a smaller value often leads to unnecessary management overhead of spilt subtasks, while a larger value will reduce the utilization efficiency of parallel resources. Thus, some numerical tests are necessary to obtain an appropriate threshold value for different tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. To achieve better parallelization performance, the threshold value T v here is defined as below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">T v = S v /P<label>(21)</label></formula><p>Where S v is the size of the father task. P is the number of computing units for parallelization. S v /P denotes the minimum integer bigger than S v /P. In Fork/Join framework, to reduce the excessive consumption caused by the frequent opening and closing of worker threads, the thread pool where the number of threads is equal to the number of computing units is often created before the calculation. During the parallel computation process of Fork/Join, the work-stealing strategy is designed to address the work queue contention problem and help the parallel algorithm make full use of multiple processors in computers. To reduce the realization difficulty of parallel algorithms, the universal Application Programming Interface (API) is provided in the Fork/Join framework. Without knowing too much on the parallelization details of complicated tasks, programmers can conveniently develop application procedures or decision support systems by calling the standard API. Besides, as the Fork/Join is a classical open source project for parallel computing, all the procedures under this framework is possessed the good cross-platform capabilities and can be executed on a lot of executive systems supporting the operations of Java Virtual Machine. Thus, given the above outstanding advantages, the Fork/Join framework is chosen for the parallelization of the MOPSO algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Parallel multi-objective particle swarm optimization</head><p>Although the MOPSO has been widely used to solve the multiobjective optimization problems in practice, there are still some shortcomings in the standard MOPSO: (1) the swarm with a large population size is easy to implement but will no doubt bring about high computational burdens; (2) the swarm use the serial computing mode to evaluate the performances of individuals but fails to use abundant parallel resources of multiple-core machine, reducing the utilization efficiency of computing resource; (3) as the evolutionary process goes on, the swarm diversity will be reduced gradually and particles may be easily trapped into local optima, resulting in the severe premature convergence problem. As a result, when employed to handle with large and complex hydropower operation problems, MOPSO may take a long time to finish the calculation process but generate pseudo Pareto optimal solutions with a high probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Thus, to avoid the above defects, the evolutionary algorithms using small population size to diversify the swarm are becoming popular in electrical power system. Meanwhile, with the rapid development of computer technologies in hardware and software, parallel computing is becoming an increasingly popular way to reduce the time of traditional algorithms. Thus, inspired by earlier research findings on multi-core parallel technique and small population-based strategy, a novel PMOPSO method displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is proposed to address the hydropower operation problem.</p><p>In PMOPSO, the evolutionary process of the swarm with large population size is treated as a father task. After generating the initial population, the divide-and-conquer strategy is employed to divide the original father task into several smaller subtasks. At this time, each subtask is seen as a subpopulation using the same evolution equation as that of the father population. Then, the main thread transmits all the subtasks and necessary basic data to the corresponding child threads, like the basic attributes, characteristic curves and operational constraints of all the hydropower plants. Each subpopulation will be executed in the allocated child thread and independently search for Pareto solution set in the solution space. If the computations of all the subpopulations are finished, the main thread will collect and then choose better particles from the results obtained by each subpopulation to form the optimal Pareto solutions for the original problem. In essence, the PMOPSO combines the advantages of small population, parallel technology to improve the population diversity and convergence speed of MOPSO at the same time. On the one hand, using the small population-based mechanism, each sub-swarm can evolve in an independent way and the individual diversity can be well maintained in the evolutionary process, effectively avoiding the premature convergence problem. On the other hand, when performed in a multi-core environment, PMOPSO can take full advantage of all the computing units for calculations, rather than a single processor in MOPSO. In such a way, the PMOPSO's execution time can be reduced significantly while its computational efficiency will be enhanced in comparison with MOPSO. In addition, the maximum scale problem of PMOPSO will show an obvious growth as the number of computing units for parallelization increases. Thus, PMOPSO is capable of finishing more tasks within the same computing time or uses less execution time to address the same task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Performance of PMOPSO in standard test functions</head><p>Here, three classical benchmark functions (ZDT1, ZDT2 and ZDT6) and two advanced indexes (convergence and diversity) are employed to testify the performance of PMOPSO. The number of particles and iterations of MOPSO and PMOPSO are set as 400 and 800, while there are 4 worker threads in PMOPSO for parallel computing. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> draws the Pareto front by PMOPSO and the true Pareto front for three standard test functions. It can be observed that the presented method can generate a set of non-dominated solutions that are distributed uniformly in the objective space, demonstrating the effectiveness of the presented approach in solving multi-objective optimization problems.

For instance, as compared with two other algorithms, the presented method can make about 0.13473 and 0.05413 reductions in the average diversity metric of ZDT2, respectively. Thus, the feasibility and practicality of PMOPSO is successfully proved by the numerical experiment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Modified domination strategy</head><p>Theoretically, the particles adjusted by the modification in above section will satisfy most of the constraints imposed on hydropower system. However, due to unreasonable scheduling process, some solutions may still violate the constraints in practice, such as power output limits or turbine discharge limits. Thus, to make the method become more workable, the total constraint violation is set as a criterion for evolutionary selection. For MOOP in Eq.

The Lancang River originates from Qinghai Province, crosses through Tibet and flows to Yunnan Province. With abundant runoff and huge vertical drop, 14 hydroplants with 24,800 MW installed capacity are planned on the main stream of Lancang River, making it become one of the 13 giant hydropower bases in China. Besides, there is no strong water supply demand in Lancang River due to the less population and relatively backward economy in surrounding cities. Then, the way to balance generation benefit and system reliability is attracting growing attention in the daily operation of the Lancang hydropower system, which will help provide stable and reliable energy for the interconnected provincial and regional power networks of China.</p><p>Nowadays, six primary hydroplants with 15,000 MW installed capacity have been built and put into operation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Parameter setting</head><p>Similar to other evolutionary algorithms, the results of PMOPSO is tightly associated with the basic parameters. To obtain appropriate parameters, the suggested values from previous literatures and some necessary numerical tests are considered simultaneously. Then, the parameters of PMOPSO and MOPSO are set as below: the number of particles is 1500; the maximum iteration is 2000; the size of external archive set is 30; ¯ and are set to be 0.9 and 0.4, respectively; the values of a 1i and a 1f are 2.6 and 0.5, respectively; the values of a 2i and a 2f are 0.5 and 2.6, respectively. Then, two methods are encoded in Java language and executed on a fourcore personal computer, while the number of worker threads in PMOPSO is equal to the number of cores in the testing machine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2.">Performance of the proposed method in dry year</head><p>In the first case, the local runoff in dry year is chosen to the Lancang hydropower system. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the objectives values of Pareto front obtained by PMOPSO. In addition, the 15 th scheme   listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> is chosen as the compromise plan for further analysis, and the detailed results are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, including water level, inflow, outflow and output. It can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> that the Pareto solutions of PMOPSO are evenly distributed in the objective space, demonstrating the strong search capability of the proposed algorithm; while the variation tendency of the data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> indicates that two optimization objectives conflict with each other because one increasing values will reduce that of the other one. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, it can be apparently seen that for the compromise solution of PMOPSO, the boundary constraints of water level and power output are well satisfied. As a leading reservoir with multi-year regulation ability, Xiaowan can in advance lower its own water level at non-flood season to keep other downstream hydroplants operating at high efficiency zones as long as possible, increasing the synergistic effect of the cascade hydropower system in the long run.

Thus, PMOPSO turns out to be an effective method to deal with the CHRO problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3.">Performance of the proposed method in normal year</head><p>In the second case, the local inflow in normal year is selected as the input of the hydropower system. The non-dominated schemes obtained by PMOPSO in normal year are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, while the Pareto optimal front obtained by three methods is drawn in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. To demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, the detailed operation results (energy storage and power output) of three schemes (1 st , 15 th and 30 th ) in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> are drawn in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, where the energy storage are calculated by the "large and medium sized hydropower reservoir scheduling specification of China".</p><p>The data listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows that there is a competitive relationship between two objectives because the more the generation, the less the firm output. From Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, it can be observed that the solutions of MOPSO and NSGA-II are dominated by PMOPSO when solving the complex CHRO problems, proving the feasibility of the present method. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, it can be clearly observed that for the energy stored in the hydropower system, there is significant difference between three schemes from January and July. Thus, more water should be stored to obtain more generation benefit; otherwise, a smoother operation process is preferred to ensure the scheduling stability of system. Besides, the total execution time of PMOPSO and MOPSO are 30.4 and 116.2 s, proving the effectiveness of parallel technique to improve the execution efficiency of traditional evolutionary algorithms. Thus, the above analysis again demonstrates the feasibility of PMOPSO for multi-objective CHRO problems. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4.">Comparison with the current method</head><p>In order to further show its superiority, the proposed method and the current method in use are applied to solve the Lancang hydropower system in a real year. The results of two methods are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>. It can be clearly seen that PMOPSO can obtain a group of solutions distributed uniformly in the objective space, while the results of the current method are dominated by that of PMOPSO. Hence, it can be concluded that as compared with the current practice used in Lancang River, PMOPSO is able to provide satisfactory scheduling results with significant improvements in generation and firm output, providing a new possibility for hydropower operation problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Robustness testing of the proposed method</head><p>To testify the robustness of the PMOPSO method for the CHRO problem, 30 independent runs are executed to observe the variations of power generation and firm output. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> displays the statistical indicators of two objectives obtained by 30 trials in both normal and dry years, while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> shows the distribution outline of the solutions in different trials. As indicated by Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>, it can be observed that in 30 runs, the solutions of PMOPSO at each trail is better than that of MOPSO, while varies in a small scope that is rather close to the best objective values. For instance, in normal year and dry year, the standard deviations of PMOPSO are far less than that of MOPSO with respective to two objectives. Thus, as compared with MOPSO, PMOPSO has better robustness in terms of the variations of initial population. Given that there are multiple computational parameters in the proposed method, it is of great importance to carry out the sensitivity analysis so as to find the most influencing parameters of the optimization problem. Thus, the classical orthogonal experi-    ment design method is adopted to test the effects of parameters on experimental results <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> shows the possible values of nine parameters for sensitivity analysis in a relative wet year, while the L 27 (3 13 ) orthogonal array is introduced to guide the experiments. Then, the detailed results of nine parameters with two singleobjective models are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>, where each data is obtained from the average of 10 independent runs. It can be observed that:</p><p>(1)for the generation maximization problem, the max inertia factor and initial social factor are two most important indexes, and the rank of parameters' importance are "Max inertia factor &gt; Initial social factor &gt; Iteration &gt; Initial cognitive factor &gt; Pop size &gt; Final cognitive factor &gt; Min inertia factor &gt; Elite particles &gt; Final social factor"; (2) for the problem with the second objective, the Pop size and max inertia factor are two most important parameters, while the importance of nine parameters are "Pop size &gt; Max inertia factor &gt; Final cognitive factor &gt; Iteration &gt; Final social factor &gt; Elite particles &gt; Min inertia factor» Initial cognitive factor &gt; Initial social factor". Thus, it can be concluded that the influences of parameters on the objectives will change with the problem features, and some numerical tests is necessary so as to determine the reasonable parameter combination.</p></div>

It can be found that the Pareto optimal front of three other methods are obviously dominated by the proposed method; besides, with an even distribution on the objective space, the proposed method can provide abundant information for operators in the daily operation of hydropower system. Moreover, the global search ability of MOPSO-I in the solution space are limited due to the changeless parameters; the execution time and solution quality of MOPSO-II are not obviously improved when the number of computing units increase, wasting the abundant resource in normal computers; in MOPSO-III, the preset size of Pareto optimal solutions cannot be generated as the values of iterations or particles are inappropriate. Thus, this case demonstrates the effectiveness of three modified strategies in enhancing the search capability of the swarm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Discussion</head><p>Form the above scenarios, it can be seen that the proposed method can provide satisfactory and stable Pareto optimal results within less execution time for different scenarios. The superi-ority of the proposed method lies in the dynamic integration of hybrid search strategy, small-population evolutionary strategy, high-performance parallel computing and constraint handling method. The time-varying parameters and mutation operator will be helpful to increase the global search ability of particles, while the small-population search strategy is adopted to diversify the swarm and increase the differences of individuals. Then, the dynamic updating elite set is able to keep better solutions and provide multiple directions for different particles, while the problem-based space identification and modified domination strategy can observably increase the feasibility of particles during the evolutionary process, while the parallel technology can take full advantage of abundant multi-core resources in computers to reduce the execution time of hydropower operation problem. In such a way, the premature convergence problem can be effectively avoided and the presented method has a strong ability to find solutions closer to the true Pareto optimal front.</p><p>To be mentioned, no quality problem is available for the river water and reservoir in the study area and our model just work for a case study in which no water quality problem is occurred. However, in practice, except for the power generation and system reliability mentioned here, other kinds of utilization requirements may be involved in the operation of cascade hydropower system, such as water supply-quality management <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, peak shaving operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, ecological protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> and pollution abatement <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Thus, it is necessary to develop a generalized multi-objective optimization model to fully reflect all the possible scheduling requirements involved in the target hydropower system. In addition, given that there are several parameters, the performance of this presented method may be affected by the problem features. Then, some numerical experiments should be done to obtain an approximate parameter combination in the practical engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, a new parallel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed and applied successfully to resolve the cascade hydropower reservoirs operation balancing benefit and firm output. By combining the merits of parallel technique and small-population evolutionary mechanism, the PMOPSO method can improve the search ability and reduce the execution time of MOPSO in a multi-core environment. Besides, the time-varying parameters, dynamic updating of leader individuals and mutation strategy are used to avoid the premature convergence; while the knowledge-based constraint handling method and the modified dominated strategy are used to improve the feasibly of particles during the evolution process. The present method is applied to the Lancang cascade hydropower reservoir in southwest China, and the results indicate that the proposed method can achieve approving performance in different cases, which may be a feasible tool for the multi-objective hydropower system operation problem. In the future, the feasibility of the presented approach in other cascade hydropower system or similar complex problems needs to be studied.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
