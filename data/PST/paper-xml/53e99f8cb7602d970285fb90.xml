<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Over the past few years, distributed control of multi-agent systems has attracted much attention from various scientific communities, due to its higher robustness, less communication cost, greater efficiency, and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. One interesting and important issue arising from distributed control of multi-agent systems is to design distributed protocols based only on the local relative information to guarantee the states of all agents to reach an agreement, known as the consensus problem.</p><p>Motivated by the pioneering work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, a general framework of the consensus problem for first-order multi-agent systems was suggested and studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The consensus conditions derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> were further relaxed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It was shown that consensus of first-order multi-agent systems can be achieved if and only if the time-varying network topology contains a directed spanning tree frequently enough as the network evolves. Recently, the consensus problem for second-order multi-agent systems has received increasing attention, partly due to its wide potential applications. Motivated by this observation, a class of second-order multi-agent system models were introduced and analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, where some sufficient conditions were obtained for achieving consensus asymptotically. By using tools from eigenvalue analysis and bifurcation theory, some necessary and sufficient conditions for second-order consensus in directed networks containing a directed spanning tree were derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The above-mentioned literature mainly focuses on consensus for a group of agents without any leader. However, in some practical applications, there might exist one or even multiple leaders in the networks. It is thus important to study consensus tracking problem in multiagent systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a distributed neighbor-based estimator was designed to solve consensus tracking problem for multi-agent systems with an active leader. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a distributed coordinated tracking problem for multiple Euler-Lagrange systems with a dynamic leader was investigated. Furthermore, several novel distributed tracking controllers were designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for multiagent systems with general linear node dynamics.</p><p>Convergence rate, as a significant performance index to evaluate the effectiveness of the control algorithms in the study of consensus tracking problem, is a hot research topic in the area of consensus problem. To obtain faster convergence rate, various consensus protocols with larger coupling strength, better communication topology and the optimal gain were designed and analyzed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, it can be observed that most of the above-mentioned consensus algorithms can only guarantee the states of agents to converge to agreement asymptotically. In practical applications, it may be desirable to achieve consensus tracking in finite time. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate the finite-time consensus tracking problem in network systems. Compared with asymptotic control for the consensus problem of multi-agent systems, finite-time control is an effective approach to construct effective protocols with high performance such as a faster convergence rate. Besides, systems under finite-time controller usually demonstrate better robustness to uncertainty and disturbance rejection. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, some continuous state feedback control laws were developed to solve finite-time synchronization problem of chaotic systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, a finite-time consensus algorithm for discrete-time systems was studied by using the property of minimal polynomial of weight matrix. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the finite-time state consensus problem under switching topology for continuous-time multi-agent systems was investigated by using a continuous protocol. Finite-time consensus problems for secondorder dynamics were also addressed by many researchers. For example, some necessary and sufficient conditions for finitetime semi-stability of homogeneous multi-agent systems were addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a simple but efficient framework was proposed to achieve finite-time decentralized formation tracking of multi-agent systems by using a decentralized sliding mode estimators.</p><p>Motivated by the above-mentioned results, this paper discusses the finite-time tracking problem of second-order multi-agent systems by using an observer-based approach. We first propose a class of finite-time tracking protocols based on the relative state information. Then, a framework for constructing a finite-time tracking protocol based only on the relative output measurements of neighboring agents is developed. It is shown that the separation principle of traditional observer-based controllers still holds in finite-time control for multi-agent systems. In contrast to the previous works related to finite-time tracking by using static state feedback, the present protocols rely only on the relative position measurements, which can be regarded as an extension of the traditional observer-based controller of a single system to the one for multi-agent systems. By using tools from homogeneous theory, it is theoretically proved that finite-time consensus tracking can be achieved for multi-agent systems with a single leader, if the topology is connected and at least one follower can obtain the position states of the leader. Furthermore, the finite-time containment control problem for multi-agent systems in the presence of multiple leaders is addressed. It is theoretically shown that the states of the followers will reach the convex hull formed by those of the leaders in finite time, if for each follower there exists at least one leader that has a directed path to that follower. Finally, an application to finite-time formation control is provided to extend the main results.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Notations and some basic preliminaries are presented in Section 2. Main theoretical results are provided in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Main results</head><p>In this section, the distributed finite-time consensus tracking control for multi-agent systems is considered. Consider a group of second-order integrator agents given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">qi = p i , ṗi = u i , i = 1, . . . , N,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where q i ∈ R n is the position of agent i, and p i ∈ R n is the velocity.

It is assumed that the leader can only be observed by a small fraction of the followers. And, if follower i can obtain the information from the leader, we refer to node i with a i(N+1) = 1 as a pinned node. Denote the Laplacian matrix between the followers as L p and matrix P as P = diag{a 1(N+1) , . . . , a N(N+1) }. The following property can be obtained by using matrix theory.</p></div>

Consider a multiagent system described by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">4</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. It is first assumed that the relative states between each agent and its neighbors can be used in this subsection.

By substituting ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">7</ref>) into (4), the closed-loop system of the multi-agent system is transformed into</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">qi = p i , ṗi = -l 1 sig  N  i=1 a ij (q i -q j ) + a i (N+1) (q i -q d N+1 )  α 1 -l 2 sig  N  i=1 a ij (p i -p j ) + a i (N+1) (p i -p d N+1 )  α 2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where i = 1, . . . , N. Denote q = (q T 1 , . . . , q T N ) T , p = (p T 1 , . . . , p T N ) T , q l = ((q d N+1 ) T , . . . , (q d N+1 ) T ) T and p l = ((p d N+1 ) T , . . . , (p d N+1 ) T ) T . Then, it follows from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">9</ref>) that the closed-loop system of the multi-agent system can be rewritten in matrix form as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">q = p, ṗ = -l 1 sig[(L p ⊗ I)q + (P ⊗ I)q l ] α 1 -l 2 sig[(L p ⊗ I)p + (P ⊗ I)p l ] α 2 ,</formula><p>where L p and P are defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.

Taking linear transformation X = (L f ⊗ I)x and Y = (L f ⊗ I)y, one gets Ẋ = Y , Ẏ = -(L f ⊗ I)(l 1 sig(X ) α 1 + l 2 sig(Y ) α 2 ). (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>According to Lemma 2 and (8), one obtains that system (10) is globally finite-time stable. Therefore, there exists T &gt; 0, such that lim t→T X = lim t→T Y = 0. By Lemma 4, one has that (L f ⊗ I) is positive definite. Thus, lim t→T x = lim t→T y = 0 since X = (L f ⊗I)x, and Y = (L f ⊗I)y, namely, q and p will converge to q l and p l in finite time, respectively. It implies that the global finite-time consensus tracking control problem of the multi-agent systems (4) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is solved by finite-time protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. This complete the proof.</p><p>Remark 2. A finite-time protocol based on relative state information is proposed in this subsection. It is assumed that the relative position and velocity information can be obtained. However, this assumption is strict with the case where only the position can be got without velocity measurement. Therefore, a novel observerbased protocol is proposed in the following context based only on the relative position measurement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, the distributed finite-time tracking control problem for a class of second-order multi-agent systems under a time-invariant communication topology has been investigated via a observer-based approach. Two new kinds of distributed finitetime protocols based on relative state of output information have been presented and analyzed, respectively. In the case of a single leader, it has been proved the position states of the followers will converge to that of the leader in a finite-time. While, the position of the followers will converge to a convex hull formed by those of the leader in finite time in the case of multiple leaders. Future work will focus on the finite-time consensus of more realistic models, such as multi-agent systems with Euler-Lagrange dynamics, and finite-time consensus under directed topologies. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
