<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>to provide secure communications. This line of work was pioneered by Wyner <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, who introduced the wiretap channel and showed that when the wiretap channel is a degraded version of the main channel, the two legitimate users can exchange secure messages at a nonzero rate without relying on a private key. In follow-up work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Wyner's result was generalized to a nondegraded discrete memoryless broadcast channel with common messages sent to both receivers and the confidential messages sent to only one of the receivers. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wiretap channel was studied, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the secrecy capacity of the quasi-static fading channel was investigated in terms of the outage probability.</p><p>Motivated by the fact that if the wiretap channel is less noisy than the main channel the secrecy capacity will be zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, some recent work has been devoted to overcoming this limitation utilizing relay cooperation, which can mainly be classified into two type methods, i.e., cooperative relaying <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and cooperative jamming <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, effective Decode-and-Forward (DF)-and Amplify-and-Forward (AF)-based cooperative relaying protocols for an improved physical layer security are proposed. Cooperative jamming is regarded as a promising approach to improve the secrecy capacity by confusing the eavesdropper with codewords independent of the confidential messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, several cooperative jamming schemes were investigated for different scenarios to increase the physical layer security. In addition, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, joint conventional relay and friendly jammer selection schemes were studied to improve the physical layer security for one-way DF relay communications and two-way AF relay communications, respectively.</p><p>Untrusted relay channels with confidential messages were first studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, where the intermediate relay acts as both an eavesdropper and a helper. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, it is indicated that cooperative transmission, even with an untrusted relay, could be beneficial in relay channels with orthogonal components. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a two-hop communication system with an untrusted intermediate relay is investigated, and it is shown that a cooperative jammer enables a positive secrecy capacity that would be otherwise impossible. Recently, two-way relay channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> have attracted lots of interest from both academic and industrial communities due to its advantage in saving bandwidth efficiently. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, both AF and DF protocols for one-way relay channels were extended to general full-duplex discrete two-way relay channel and halfduplex Gaussian two-way relay channel, respectively. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, different relay strategies consisting of AF, DF, and Estimateand-Forward for uncoded two-way relay channels were investigated. Although two-way relay systems have received much attention so far, their physical layer security issues, particularly in the two-way untrusted relay scenario, have not been well investigated.</p><p>Game theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> offers a formal analytical framework with a set of mathematical tools to study the complex interactions among interdependent rational players. Recently, there has been significant growth in research activities that use game theory for analyzing communication networks, mainly due to the need for developing autonomous, distributed, and flexible mobile networks where the network devices can make independent and rational strategic decisions, as well as the need for low complexity distributed algorithms for competitive or collaborative scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, some recent studies on signal processing and communication networks using game theory are introduced. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, game theory is employed to physical layer security to study the interactions between the source and the friendly jammers who can assist the source by distracting the eavesdropper, and some distributed game-based solutions are obtained.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate physical layer security issues in a two-way untrusted relay system with friendly jammers. The two sources can exchange information only through an untrusted intermediate relay as there is no direct communication link between them. The untrusted AF relay acts as both an essential relay and a malicious eavesdropper that has the incentive to eavesdrop on the information transmission. For comparison, we first investigate the two-way untrusted relay system without friendly jammers as a special case and find that a nonzero secrecy rate is indeed available, even without the help of external friendly jammers. Optimal transmitting power of the two sources is also derived to maximize the secrecy rate in this special case. As for the system with friendly jammers, after further analysis, we can obtain that the secrecy rate of the sources can effectively be improved by utilizing proper jamming power from the friendly jammers. Then, the problem comes to how to effectively utilize the jamming power from different friendly jammers to maximize the secrecy rate. Thus, we formulate a Stackelberg game between the sources and the friendly jammers as a power control scheme. In the proposed game, the sources as the sole buyer pay the friendly jammers for the jamming power that confuses the untrusted relay to increase the secrecy rate, whereas the friendly jammers charge the sources with the asking prices for their jamming services. Furthermore, the optimal solutions of the jamming power and the asking prices are given, and a distributed updating algorithm to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium is provided for the proposed game. In addition, a centralized scheme for the jamming power control problem is also given for comparison with the proposed Stackelberg-game-based distributed updating algorithm. Finally, the properties and efficiency of the proposed Stackelberg-game-based scheme are verified by simulations.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the two-way untrusted relay system with friendly jammers is described, and the corresponding secrecy rate is formulated. In Section III, the two-way untrusted relay system without friendly jammers as a special case is investigated. In Section IV, we propose a Stackelberg type of buyer/seller game to study the optimization problem of physical layer security in the two-way untrusted relay system with friendly jammers and provide a distributed updating algorithm to obtain the optimal solutions. Simulation results are provided in Section V, and the conclusions are drawn in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we consider a two-way relay scenario consisting of two sources, one untrusted intermediate relay, and N friendly jammers, which are denoted by S k , k = 1, 2, R, and J i , i = 1, 2, . . . , N, respectively. Denote the set of indices {1, 2, . . . , N} by N . Each node here is equipped with a single omnidirectional antenna and operates in a half-duplex manner, i.e., it cannot receive and transmit simultaneously. Then, the complete transmission can be divided into two phases. During the first phase, shown with solid lines, both sources transmit their information to the intermediate relay. Simultaneously, the friendly jammers also transmit the jamming signals to distract the malicious relay. During the second phase, shown with dashed lines, the intermediate relay broadcasts a combined version of the received signals to both sources. Note that in the investigated system, there is only one intermediate relay, and we assume that no direct link exists between the two sources. Thus, this sole untrusted relay is necessary for the two-way relaying data transmission. A key assumption 1 we make here is that the sources have perfect knowledge of the jamming signals transmitted by the friendly jammers for they have paid for the jamming service.</p><p>Let s 1 , s 2 , and s J i , i ∈ N , denote the signals transmitted by S 1 , S 2 , and the friendly jammers J i , i ∈ N , respectively. Suppose S 1 and S 2 transmit with power p 1 and p 2 , respectively, and the channel gains from the sources to the intermediate relay 1 We can guarantee this by using some pseudo-random codes that are known to both the friendly jammers and the sources but not open to the malicious relay. Beyond this, we can also use some cryptographic signals at the friendly jammers for jamming, where the decryption book is a secret key only open to the sources. Then, the sources can have perfect knowledge of the jamming signals if each friendly jammer sends some additional bits consisting of the information of the jamming signals transmitted (e.g., which code or which encryption method to be used) to the sources periodically. are h S k ,R , k = 1, 2. Each friendly jammer J i transmits with power p J i , and the channel gain from it to the intermediate relay is h J i ,R , i ∈ N . Here, the channel gains contain the distance-dependent path loss and the small-scale fading. In addition, we assume that the small-scale fading is quasi-static Rayleigh fading with zero mean and unit variance, i.e., the fading coefficients stay the same within one data frame and vary independently from one data frame to another.</p><p>In phase 1, the received signal at the intermediate relay can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y r = n r + √ p 1 s 1 h S 1 ,R + √ p 2 s 2 h S 2 ,R + i∈N p J i s J i h J i ,R<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where n r represents the thermal noise at the intermediate relay, which is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance σ 2 , i.e., CN (0, σ 2 ). Furthermore, we assume that the thermal noise at S 1 , S 2 , and R, denoted by n 1 , n 2 , and n r , respectively, are independent identically distributed.</p><p>In phase 2, the intermediate relay, working in AF mode, amplifies the received signal y r by a factor β and then broadcasts the signal to both S 1 and S 2 with power p r . The power normalized factor β at the intermediate relay can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">β = p 1 |h S 1 ,R | 2 +p 2 |h S 2 ,R | 2 + i∈N p J i |h J i ,R | 2 + σ 2 -1/2 .</formula><p>(2) Then, the corresponding signal received by S 1 , denoted by y 1 , can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y 1 = β √ p r h S 1 ,R y r +n 1 = ξ 1 s 1 +υ 1 s 2 + i∈N µ 1,i s J i +ω 1 (3)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ξ 1 ∆ = β √ p r p 1 h 2 S 1 ,R , υ 1 ∆ = β √ p r p 2 h S 1 ,R h S 2 ,R , µ 1,i ∆ = β p r p J i h J i ,R h S 1 ,R , and ω 1 ∆ = β √ p r h S 1 ,R n r + n 1 .</formula><p>Similarly, the signal received by S 2 , which is denoted by y 2 , can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y 2 = β √ p r h S 2 ,R y r +n 2 = ξ 2 s 1 +υ 2 s 2 + i∈N µ 2,i s J i +ω 2 (4)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ξ 2 ∆ = β √ p r p 1 h S 1 ,R h S 2 ,R , υ 2 ∆ = β √ p r p 2 h 2 S 2 ,R , µ 2,i ∆ = β p r p J i h J i ,R h S 2 ,R , and ω 2 ∆ = β √ p r h S 2 ,R n r + n 2 .</formula><p>Assuming that both the sources and the friendly jammers are independent, from (1), in phase 1, using the matched filter, 2 the untrusted intermediate relay has the capacity with respect to S 1 and S 2 as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">C m 1 = W 2 log 2   1 + p 1 g S 1 ,R σ 2 + p 2 g S 2 ,R + i∈N p J i g J i ,R   (5) C m 2 = W 2 log 2   1 + p 2 g S 2 ,R σ 2 + p 1 g S 1 ,R + i∈N p J i g J i ,R  <label>(6)</label></formula><p>2 For simplicity, here, we use the matched filter for signal detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> while many other advanced detectors can be applied and the analysis can be done in a similar way.</p><p>where W represents the channel bandwidth, g S 1 ,R</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∆ = |h S 1 ,R | 2 , g S 2 ,R ∆ = |h S 2 ,R | 2 , and g J i ,R ∆ = |h J i ,R | 2 , i ∈ N .</formula><p>In phase 2, at S 1 , since s 1 as well as s J i , i ∈ N , is known to the source, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ỹ1 = υ 1 s 2 + ω 1 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SECRECY RATE OF TWO-WAY RELAY CHANNEL WITHOUT FRIENDLY JAMMERS</head><p>For comparison, we first investigate the special case without friendly jammers in this section. We indicate that there indeed exists a positive secrecy rate for the two-way untrusted relay channel even without the help of friendly jammers. Furthermore, we obtain an optimal power vector of the sources and the relay that maximizes the secrecy rate.</p><p>From ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">16</ref>), and the expressions of K 1 in (10) and K 2 in (8), we can write the probability of the existence of a nonzero secrecy rate as</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">P Cs 1 &gt; 0, Cs 2 &gt; 0 = P(K 1 &lt; p 2 g S 2 ,R , K 2 &lt; p 1 g S 1 ,R ) = P p r &gt; max Q p 2 g 2 S 2 ,R , Q p 1 g 2 S 1 ,R<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Q = (p 1 g S 1 ,R + p 2 g S 2 ,R + σ 2 )σ 2 .</formula><p>From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">17</ref>), we can obtain that the probability of the existence of a nonzero secrecy rate is equivalent to the probability that the inequality <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">17</ref>) is only a function form representing the probability that event X happens and thus we do not need to provide the detailed closed-form expression of it. Considering the power constraints 0 &lt; p 1 ≤ p max , 0 &lt; p 2 ≤ p max , and 0 &lt; p r ≤ p max , we have that there exists at least one pair of (p r , p 1 , p 2 ) that satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">p r &gt; max{(Q/p 2 g 2 S 2 ,R ), (Q/p 1 g 2 S 1 ,R )} holds.

Then, the problem comes to how to control the jamming power from different friendly jammers when optimizing the secrecy rate of the sources. In general, in a cooperative wireless network with selfish nodes, nodes may not serve a common goal or belong to a single authority. Thus, a mechanism of reimbursement to the friendly jammers should be employed such that the friendly jammers can earn benefits from spending their own transmitting power in helping the sources for secure data transmission. For the source side, the sources aim to achieve the best performance of secrecy rate with the least reimbursements. For the friendly jammer side, each friendly jammer aims to earn the payment not only covers its transmitting cost but also gains as many extra profits as possible. Therefore, we employ a Stackelberg game model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> as a power control scheme jointly considering both benefits of the sources and the friendly jammers. In the proposed Stackelberg game model, the two sources as a unity is the sole buyer that starts the Stackelberg game process, and the friendly jammers act as the sellers; therefore, the sources are treated as the leader, whereas the friendly jammers are the followers. Furthermore, the optimal solutions of the jamming power and the asking price are investigated, and a corresponding distributed updating algorithm is provided. Finally, a centralized scheme is given for performance comparison.</p></div>

Secrecy Rate Improved Using Friendly Jammers</head><p>From ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">14</ref>), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">C s 1 = W 2   log 2   1+ p 1 g S 1 ,R σ 2 +K 1 + i∈N σ 2 g J i ,R p r g S 2 ,R p J i    -log 2   1+ p 1 g S 1 ,R σ 2 +p 2 g S 2 ,R + i∈N g J i ,R p J i     + (23) C s 2 = W 2   log 2   1+ p 2 g S 2 ,R σ 2 +K 2 + i∈N σ 2 g J i ,R p r g S 1 ,R p J i    -log 2   1+ p 2 g S 2 ,R σ 2 +p 1 g S 1 ,R + i∈N g J i ,R p J i     + . (24)</formula><p>From ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>), we can see that both C k and C m k , k = 1, 2 are decreasing and convex functions of p J i , i ∈ N . However, if C m k decreases faster than C k as p J i increases, C s k may increase in some region of p J i . However, when p J i further increases, both C k and C m k will approach zero. As a result, C s k approaches zero. Compared with ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">16</ref>), we can obtain that if (σ 2 g J i ,R /p r g S 2 ,R ) &lt; g J i ,R and (σ 2 g J i ,R /p r g S 1 ,R ) &lt; g J i ,R , ∀i ∈ N , i.e., (σ 2 /p r ) &lt; min{g S 1 ,R , g S 2 ,R }, the gain of the secrecy rate will be above zero in some region of the jamming power. Then, the problem comes to how to utilize the jamming power from different friendly jammers effectively to maximize the secrecy rate. Thus, we propose a Stackelberg game model to achieve effective jamming power control in the following sections. Note that synchronization among the sources and the friendly jammers is important in the investigated system with friendly jammers. Much work has been devoted to the synchronization issues among distributed nodes in cooperative networks, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, effective synchronization schemes among distributed sensors and cooperative relays with low complexity and good performance were proposed. Thus, the synchronization issue among the sources and the friendly jammers can effectively be addressed using methods similar to those proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. However, this is not the key investigated issue in this paper; therefore, we assume that perfect synchronization among the sources and the friendly jammers is implemented in the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Source Side Game</head><p>We consider the two sources as two buyers who expect to optimize the secrecy rate with the help of the friendly jammers, whereas the cost paid for the jamming service, i.e., the jamming power p J i , i ∈ N , should also be taken into consideration.

When considering the optimal transmitting power vector of S 1 and S 2 , i.e., (p 1 , p 2 ) to achieve the maximum utility in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, the jamming power p J i , i ∈ N can be treated as constant since all the nodes transmit with independent power. Thus, we can obtain similar results of the optimal power solutions as given in Section III. However, to obtain the optimal solutions of p 1 and p 2 is not our main purpose in this section. Instead, we formulate the source side game to investigate how to effectively utilize the jamming power from different friendly jammers achieving the maximum utility of the sources.</p><p>Then, the source side game can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">max U s = max (a (C s 1 + C s 2 ) -M ) s.t.

The solutions to the high-order equation ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>) can be expressed in closed form, but the closed-form expressions of the solutions are extremely complex and have little necessity for our following work. Actually, our particular interest are not the closed-form expressions of the optimal jamming power solution but the parameters that affect these optimal solutions.

Note that there may be up to eight roots of the polynomial equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>; the selected solution should be a real root and can lead to a higher value of U s in (28) than the other real ones.

In this special case, we assume that there is one friendly jammer in the system staying very close to the untrusted relay so that the interference from the friendly jammer is much stronger than the received signals from the sources at the untrusted relay. Meanwhile, we also assume that the received signal power is much higher than the noise, i.e., high SNR assumption, which means</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">σ 2 p 1 g S 1 ,R p J 1 g J 1 ,R and σ 2 p 2 g S 2 ,R p J 1 g J 1 ,R .

The simulation results indicate that the sources always prefer to buy jamming power from only one friendly jammer when there exists at least one sufficiently effective friendly jammer, which is more effective to perform jamming than the other friendly jammers and is simultaneously asking for a proper price. Therefore, this special case with one friendly jammer experiencing severe interference is valid in analyzing the proposed game. Under this special case, we can get a property of the proposed game that the optimal jamming power p J * 1 is a monotonous function of the asking price m 1 , which can help to prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium in Section IV-D.

Friendly Jammer Side Game</head><p>For each friendly jammer, we can define the utility function as</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">U i = m i p J i c i , i ∈ N (<label>39</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_63">)</formula><p>where c i ≥ 1 is a constant to balance the payment m i p J i from the sources and the transmission cost p J i of the friendly jammer itself.

Note that the jamming power p J i is also a function of the vector of asking prices (m 1 , m 2 , . . . , m N ), as the amount of the jamming power that the sources will buy also depends on the prices that the friendly jammers ask.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Stackelberg Equilibrium of the Proposed Game</head><p>In this section, we investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium of the proposed game, at which neither the sources nor each friendly jammer can further improve its utility by changing its own strategy only. From the game definitions of the source side in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> and the friendly jammer side in (40), we can define the Stackelberg equilibrium as follows.</p><p>Definition 1: p J i_SE and m i_SE are the Stackelberg equilibria of the proposed game if when m i is fixed</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">U s p J i_SE = sup 0≤p J i ≤p max ,i∈N U s p J i (<label>45</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_71">)</formula><p>and when</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">p J i is fixed U i (m i_SE ) = sup m i U i (m i ), ∀i ∈ N . (<label>46</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_73">)</formula><p>From the analysis in the previous two sections, we have that {p J i_opt } N i=1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> and {m i_opt } N i=1 in (44) are the optimal solutions of the jamming power needed by the sources and the asking prices given by the friendly jammers when solving the utility optimization problem in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">27</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_64">40</ref>). Thus, we can obtain the property that the pair of {p J i_opt } N i=1 and {m i_opt } N i=1 is the Stackelberg equilibrium of the proposed game. We can easily prove this property theoretically in the special high interference case with one efficient friendly jammer close to the untrusted relay. In Section IV-B, we have proved that in this special case, the optimal jamming power solution p J 1_opt is monotone decreasing and convex with the asking price m 1 when the other friendly jammers' prices are fixed. Therefore, we can obtain that there exists a unique Stackelberg equilibrium that is just the optimal solution of the jamming power and the asking prices. However, due to the extremely complex closedform expressions of the optimal solutions, for more general cases, the proof in theory is intractable, and thus instead, we prove by simulations in Section V that the proposed game can effectively converge to a unique Stackelberg equilibrium, which are the optimal solutions of the jamming power and the asking prices when maximizing the utilities of the sources and the friendly jammers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Distributed Updating Algorithm</head><p>In this section, we construct a corresponding distributed updating algorithm for the proposed game to converge to the Stackelberg equilibrium defined above. By rearranging (43), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">m i = I i (m) = - p J i_opt c i ∂p J i_opt ∂m i (<label>47</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_75">)</formula><p>where m = [m 1 , m 2 , . . . , m N ] T , p J i_opt is a function of m, and I i (m) is the price updating function for friendly jammer J i , i ∈ N . The information for updating can be obtained from the sources, which is similar to the distributed power allocation scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The distributed updating algorithm can be expressed in vector form as</p><formula xml:id="formula_76">m(t + 1) = I (m(t))<label>(48)</label></formula><p>where I = [I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I N ] T is the updating function in the proposed distributed updating algorithm, and the iteration here is from time t to time t + 1. Furthermore, we can obtain the convergence of the proposed algorithm by proving that the updating function in (48) is a standard function <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> defined as follows.</p><p>Definition 2: A function I(m) is standard if, for all m ≥ 0, the following properties are satisfied:</p><p>1) Positivity: I(m) ≥ 0.</p><p>2) Monotonicity: If m ≥ m , then I(m) ≥ I(m ), or I(m) ≤ I(m ). 3) Scalability: For all η &gt; 1, ηI(m) ≥ I(ηm). Similar to the situation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, we can get that each friendly jammer's asking price will converge to a fixed point, i.e., the Stackelberg equilibrium in the proposed game, from any feasible initial asking price vector m(0). The positivity property of the updating function is easy to prove. We have that if the asking price m i goes up, the sources will buy less jamming power from the friendly jammer J i . Therefore, (∂p J i_opt /∂m i ) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_74">47</ref>) is negative, and thus, we can prove the positivity property of the updating function as</p><formula xml:id="formula_77">I i (m) = -((p J i_opt )/c i (∂p J i_opt /∂m i )) &gt; 0, ∀i ∈ N .</formula><p>Because of the complexity of the optimal solutions in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_46">31</ref>) and (44), the monotonicity and scalability properties of the updating function can only be shown in the special high interference case. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_55">35</ref>) and (47), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">I 1 (m) = - p J * 1 c 1 ∂p J * 1 ∂m 1 = - D 1 m 1 -c 1 2 √ D 1 m -3 2 1 = 2m 1 c 1<label>(49)</label></formula><p>which is monotone increasing with the asking price m 1 and scalable.</p><p>For more general cases, the analysis is intractable. However, in Section V, we employ the general case setups for simulations, and the simulation results show that the proposed distributed updating algorithm can converge to a unique distributed optimal solution and outperform the case without friendly jammers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Centralized Scheme for Comparison</head><p>In this section, assuming that all the channel information is known by a virtual centralized controller, we formulate the centralized scheme by optimizing the secrecy rate as</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">max p J i C s = max p J i (C s 1 + C s 2 ) s.t. 0 ≤ p J i ≤ p max , i ∈ N (<label>50</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_80">)</formula><p>where C s 1 and C s 2 can be obtained from ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, respectively. The centralized optimal solution is found by maximizing the secrecy rate only.</p><p>In Section V, we compare the proposed Stackelberg-gamebased distributed updating algorithm with this centralized scheme. From the simulation results, we can see that the distributed solution and the centralized solution are asymptotically the same, particularly when the gain factor a in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">27</ref>) is sufficiently large. However, the centralized scheme needs to solve an N-arguments optimization problem that has high computational complexity. Instead, the distributed solution can be obtained through a distributed iteration process with low computational complexity. Moreover, the distributed solution only needs to update the difference of the jamming power and the asking prices to be adaptive, whereas the centralized one requires all the channel information in each data frame. Therefore, the proposed Stackelberg-game-based distributed updating algorithm is more efficient in practical applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS</head><p>To evaluate the performances, we conduct the following simulations. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we consider a two-way relay system where S 1 , S 2 , and the intermediate relay R are located at (-1, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 0), respectively. The other simulation parameters are set up as follows: the maximum power constraint p max = 10; the transmission bandwidth W = 1; the noise variance σ 2 = 0.01; the distance-dependent path loss factor is 2; and a = 1 for the source side utility in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>For the special case without friendly jammers, we set the jamming power equal to zero. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref> show the performance of the secrecy rate as a function of the two sources' transmitting power p 1 and p 2 in this special case, which we have that the optimal power solution of (p 1 , p 2 ) is (0.22p max , p max ) when g S 1 ,R = 0.3857 and g S 2 ,R = 0.0443, and (p max , 0.32p max ) when g S 1 ,R = 0.0508 and g S 2 ,R = 0.3018. After further calculation, we see that the results agree with the optimal power solutions given in Section III.</p><p>For the single-jammer case, we consider two friendly jammer locations, i.e., (0.3, 0.4) and (0.6, 0.8). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows the performance of the secrecy rate as a function of the jamming power when p 1 , p 2 , and p r are all set up to p max . We can see that with the increase of the jamming power, the secrecy rate first increases and then decreases. There indeed exists an optimal point for the jamming power. Moreover, the optimal  point depends on the location of the friendly jammer, and we can find that the friendly jammer close to the untrusted relay is more effective to improve the secrecy rate. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows that the optimal jamming power bought by the sources depends on the price asked by the friendly jammer. We can see that the optimal jamming power gets reduced if the asking price goes high and that the sources will even stop buying after some asking price point. Thus, there is a tradeoff for the friendly jammer to set the asking price. If the asking price is set too high, the sources will buy less jamming power or even stop buying.</p><p>For the multiple-jammer case, we consider two friendly jammers that are located at (0.3, 0.4) and (0.5, 0.5), respectively. Note that in the simulations of this scenario, the friendly jammers are both sufficiently effective jammers. Here, we define the friendly jammer J i as a sufficiently effective jammers if it on its own can offer a jamming power p J i , p J i ∈ (0, p max ], making the secrecy rate improved up to the maximum value. In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, the secrecy rate C s , the sources' utility U s , the first friendly jammer's utility U 1 , and the second friendly jammer's utility U 2 as functions of both the friendly jammers' asking  prices are shown, respectively. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, we can see that there exists an upper bound and a lower bound for the secrecy rate when the channel conditions are settled. When one of the two friendly jammers' asking prices is low enough, the sources can buy sufficient jamming power from the corresponding friendly jammer to the secrecy rate up to the upper bound. When both the friendly jammers' asking prices are beyond the sources' payment ability, the secrecy rate will stay at the lower bound, which is the same as that of the case without friendly jammers as the sources no longer buy jamming power from the friendly jammers. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, we can see that if at least one of the two friendly jammers sets a low asking price, the sources' utility is high as the sources can achieve high secrecy rate at a low cost. With both the friendly jammers' asking prices going high, the sources' utility decreases. When the asking prices of both friendly jammers are so high that the sources can no longer benefit from the jamming service at such a high cost the sources will stop buying. In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, we can find that under this condition (i.e., both of the friendly jammers are sufficiently effective ones), the sources will always prefer to buy jamming service from only one of the friendly jammers for the best performance. The selected friendly jammer is either the one more effective to improve the secrecy rate when the asking prices of both friendly jammers are comparable or the one whose asking price is low enough. For the friendly jammer side, if a friendly jammer asks a too low price, its utility will be very low. However, if a friendly jammer asks a price that is too high, the sources might buy the jamming service from the other friendly jammer. Therefore, there is an optimal asking price for each friendly jammer, and the sources will always select the one that can provide the best performance improvement.</p><p>For the multiple-jammer case, we also discuss how the optimal secrecy rate changes with the number of friendly jammers increasing. We conduct simulations under two different scenarios, i.e., there exists at least one sufficiently effective friendly jammer, and there is no sufficiently effective friendly jammer. Here, no sufficiently effective friendly jammer means that the sources cannot achieve the maximum secrecy rate with only one friendly jammer's help. Therefore, the sources have to first sort the current friendly jammers in an order of effectiveness and then buy the jamming power from the most effective friendly jammer one by one until the secrecy rate reaches the maximum value. From ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>), we have that if the channel conditions and the transmitting power of the sources and the intermediate relay are settled, the maximum achievable secrecy rate will not change, no matter how many friendly jammers are used and how much jamming power bought by the sources from each friendly jammer. For the nonsufficiently effective friendly jammer scenario, we set the friendly jammer J i located at (x i , y i ), i ∈ N , where x 2 i +y 2 i &gt; 4. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>, the optimal secrecy rate as a function of the number of friendly jammers is shown. We can see that if there exists sufficiently effective friendly jammers, the optimal secrecy rate does not change as the number of friendly jammers increases. For the sources, they will always choose the most effective friendly jammer to achieve the maximum secrecy rate. In other words, in this scenario, the optimal secrecy rate can reach the maximum value with the most effective friendly jammer's help only. On the other hand, if there are no sufficiently effective friendly jammers, the optimal secrecy rate will be improved up to the maximum value as the number of friendly jammers increases.  Finally, we compare the proposed Stackelberg-game-based distributed updating algorithm with the centralized scheme in terms of secrecy rate. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> shows the optimal secrecy rate with the distributed updating algorithm and the centralized scheme as a function of gain factor a in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> with the friendly jammer located at (1, 1). When a is large, the sources will care the gain of the secrecy rate more than the jamming service cost in the Stackelberg-game-based algorithm. We can see that the performance gap between the distributed updating algorithm and the centralized scheme in terms of the optimal secrecy rate shrinks as a increases. Moreover, the performances are asymptotically the same when a is sufficiently large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have investigated the physical layer security issue for two-way relay communications with an untrusted intermediate relay and friendly jammers. As a special case, the two-way relay system without friendly jammers was first studied. In this special case, we indicated that a nonzero secrecy rate for the two-way untrusted relay system is indeed available and further derived the optimal transmitting power of the two sources maximizing the secrecy rate. As for the two-way relay system with friendly jammers, we first found that the secrecy rate can be effectively improved by utilizing proper jamming power from the friendly jammers and then formulated a Stackelberg game between the sources and the friendly jammers to solve the optimization problem in a distributed manner. From the simulation results, we can see the efficiency of the proposed Stackelberg-game-based distributed updating algorithm, which has similar performance but much lower computational complexity compared with the centralized scheme.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
