<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N the past decade, adaptive control design for stochastic systems has received increasing attention. Based on the Itô stochastic differential equation, many stochastic nonlinear system control results and the methods, such as sliding mode control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, Lyapunov function approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and T-S fuzzy control <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, have been reported in the literature. In recent years, the well-known backstepping technique has been applied to solve the control problem of stochastic nonlinear systems in strict-feedback form (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>). The backstepping design for stochastic single-input and single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> by introducing Quartic Lyapunov function. The robust adaptive backstepping design approaches were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for stochastic SISO nonlinear systems with unmodeled dynamics by changing supply function and small-gain theorem. The obtained results were extended to stochastic nonlinear largescale systems and adaptive decentralized backstepping control approaches were developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. It should be pointed out that the above mentioned results are only suitable for those stochastic nonlinear systems, in which the nonlinearities are known exactly or can be linearly parameterized. Therefore, they can not be applied to those stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear functions.</p><p>Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) or neural networks (NNs) have been proved to be universal approximators, i.e., they can approximate any nonlinear functions. Therefore, FLSs and NNs have been widely adopted for nonlinear identification and control <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Using the idea of adaptive backstepping technique with the help of FLSs and NNs, many approximatorbased adaptive control approaches were developed for uncertain stochastic nonlinear systems, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and references therein. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed adaptive fuzzy or NN state feedback control approaches for a class of SISO stochastic nonlinear systems with or without time delays; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> developed adaptive output feedback controllers for SISO stochastic nonlinear systems without unmeasured states, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> investigated the adaptive fuzzy or NN decentralized output feedback stabilization problem for a class of stochastic large-scale nonlinear systems. To handle the unmodeled dynamics involved in the considered stochastic systems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> developed a robust adaptive output-feedback controller based on small-gain theorem, and the obtained adaptive control scheme not only guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system, but also has strong robustness to the unmodeled dynamics. The main features of these adaptive approaches are: (i) they can be used to deal with those nonlinear systems without satisfying the so-called the matching condition, and (ii) they do not require that the unknown nonlinear functions are linearly parameterized. Instead, the fuzzy logic systems or neural networks are utilized to approximate them adaptively.</p><p>Note that the aforementioned approximator-based adaptive control approaches assume that all the components in the considered stochastic nonlinear systems are in good operating conditions. In fact, there always exist some faults, such as actuators and sensors in the real processes, which often degrade the control performances and even result in the instability of the control system or even catastrophic accidents. It is thus necessary to develop a robust controller or a fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme against actuator or sensor failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>To handle the problem of nonlinear system with actuator or sensor faults, many FTC approaches have been developed, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and references therein. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> presented adaptive fault-tolerant controllers for linear systems with both loss of effectiveness and lock-in-place actuator faults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> developed adaptive fault-tolerant controllers for a class of SISO nonlinear systems and MIMO nonlinear systems with the same actuator faults as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> developed observer-based adaptive backstepping fault-tolerant control approaches for some nonlinear systems with additive profile faults. However, the above mentioned fault-tolerant control schemes require that the considered nonlinear systems satisfy the matching conditions. To remove these limitations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> investigated a class of unknown SISO nonlinear strict-feedback systems with both loss of effectiveness and lock-in-place actuator faults, in which fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate the unknown functions, and based on the backstepping technique, two adaptive fuzzy backstepping FTC schemes were developed. The proposed control schemes guarantee not only the stability of the control system, but also have the robust performance of the failed system. On the basis of the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> proposed an adaptive fuzzy backstepping FTC scheme for a class of unknown MIMO strict-feedback nonlinear systems, and the stability of the control system was proved. However, the adaptive FTC methods described previously suffer from their requirements to measure the state variables directly. To solve the states unmeasured problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> developed two fuzzy adaptive output feedback FTC methods for a class of nonlinear systems with actuator faults. It should be mentioned that the proposed adaptive control approaches are only restricted to a class of uncertain deterministic nonlinear systems, while the stochastic disturbances and the unmodeled dynamics are neglected. As stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, the robustness of adaptive failure compensation designs with respect to system modeling errors such as unmodeled dynamics and disturbances is an important issue, thus motivated us for this study.</p><p>Inspired by previous work, this paper focuses on the fuzzy adaptive actuator failure compensation control for a class of uncertain stochastic nonlinear systems in strict-feedback form. These stochastic nonlinear systems contain the actuator faults of both loss of effectiveness and lock-in-place, unmodeled dynamics, and without direct measurements of state variables. With the help of fuzzy logic systems to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, a fuzzy state observer is established to estimate the unmeasured states. By introducing the dynamical signal and the changing supply function technique design into the backstepping control design, a robust adaptive fuzzy fault-tolerant control scheme is developed. It is shown that the proposed control approach can guarantee that all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are bounded in probability. Comparing with the existing results, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (i) this paper first investigates an adaptive fuzzy FTC approach for a class of uncertain stochastic nonlinear systems with actuator failures and unmodeled dynamics. The same problems are also addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, however, the adaptive FTC approaches in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> all focus on the deterministic linear or nonlinear systems. They can not be applied to control the stochastic nonlinear systems considered in this paper; (ii) the nonlinear systems under consideration in this paper include actuator failures, unmodeled dynamics and stochastic disturbances. Consequently, the proposed adaptive controller can not only accommodate the actuator faults, but also has the robustness to the unmodeled dynamics and stochastic disturbances, while the existing results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> can only compensate the actuator faults. (iii) The proposed fuzzy adaptive FTC approach cancels the restricted condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> that all states of the controlled systems are available for measurement. Instead, a fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states, and the whole control system stability is proved by using Lyaponuv function and the changing supply function methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has developed an adaptive fuzzy control method for accommodating actuator faults in a class of uncertain stochastic nonlinear systems with both unmodeled dynamics and unmeasured states. The considered faults are modeled as both loss of effectiveness and lock-in-place. With the help of fuzzy logic systems approximating the unknown nonlinear functions, a fuzzy state observer has been designed for estimating the unmeasured states. Combining the backstepping technique with changing supply function, a novel adaptive fuzzy faults-tolerant control approach has been developed. The proposed control approach can not only guarantee that all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are bounded in probability, but also have the robustness to the unmodeled dynamics and stochastic disturbances. Simulation results have been provided to show the effectiveness of the control approach. Future research will be concentrated on the adaptive FTC methods for uncertain MIMO stochastic nonlinear sys- </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>From (70) and (71), one has d(e Ct V k-1 ) ≤ e Ct Ddt + e Ct n i=1 M i dw (66) Integrating (65) over [T k-1 , T k ], we get</figDesc></figure>
