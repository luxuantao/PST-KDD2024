<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In this paper by graph we mean a simple graph. The vertex set and edge set of a graph G are denoted by V (G) and E(G), respectively. The length of a path between two vertices is the number of edges on that path. We define the distance between two vertices to be the length of the shortest path between them. The square of a graph G, denoted by G 2 , is a graph on the same vertex set such that two vertices are adjacent in G 2 iff their distance in G is at most 2. The degree of a vertex v is the number of edges incident with v and is denoted by d G <ref type="bibr">(v)</ref> or simply d(v) if it is not confusing. We denote the maximum degree of a graph G by (G) or simply . If the degree of v is i, at least i, or at most i we call it an i-vertex, a i-vertex, or a i-vertex, respectively. By N G (v), we mean the open neighborhood of v in G, which contains all those vertices that are adjacent to v in G. The closed neighborhood of v, which is denoted by N G <ref type="bibr">[v]</ref>, is N G (v) ∪ {v}. We usually use N(v) and N [v] instead of N G <ref type="bibr">(v)</ref> and N G <ref type="bibr">[v]</ref>, respectively.</p><p>A vertex k-coloring of a graph G is a mapping C : V -→ {1, . . . , k} such that any two adjacent vertices u and v are mapped to different integers. The minimum k for which a coloring exists is called the chromatic number of G and is denoted by (G). The well known result of Appel and Haken <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> states that: Theorem 1.1 (The Four Color Theorem). For every planar graph G: (G) 4.</p><p>The question of finding the best-possible upper bound for the chromatic number of the square of a planar graph seems to first have been asked by Wegner <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21]</ref>. He posed the following conjecture: Conjecture 1.2. For a planar graph G,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(G 2 ) + 5 if 4 7, 3 2 + 1 if 8.</formula><p>Wegner gave examples illustrating that these bounds are best possible. He also showed that if = 3 then G 2 can be 8-colored and conjectured that 7 colors would be enough. Very recently, Thomassen <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref> has solved this conjecture for = 3, by showing that the square of every cubic planar graph is 7-colorable, but the conjecture for general planar graphs remains open.</p><p>Wegner's conjecture is mentioned in [14, Section 2.18], followed by a brief history of it. One might think that since every planar graph has a 5-vertex then this trivially implies a greedy algorithm for (5 + 1)-coloring of G 2 . See <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref> why this straightforward argument does not work. Jonas <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[13]</ref> in his Ph.D. Thesis proved (G 2 ) 8 -22. This bound was later improved by Wong <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref> to (G 2 ) 3 + 5. Then van den Heuvel and McGuinness <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref> proved (G 2 ) 2 + 25. For large values of , Agnarsson and Halldórsson <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> have a better asymptotic bound. They showed that if G is a planar graph with 749, then (G 2 ) 9 5 + 2. Recently, Borodin et al. <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref> have been able to extend this result further by proving (G 2 ) Remark. The constants 78 and 25 in the above theorems can be improved. For example with an extra page of proof the first constant can be brought down to 61 but we do not know how to bring it down to a number close to 1, using this proof.</p><p>The technique we use is inspired by that used by Sanders and Zhao <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[17]</ref> to obtain a similar bound on the cyclic chromatic number of planar graphs.</p><p>A generalization of ordinary vertex coloring is L(p, q)-labeling. Let dist(u, v) denote the distance between u and v. For integers p, q 0, an L(p, q)-labeling of a graph G is a mapping L : V (G) -→ {0, . . . , k} such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• |L(u) -L(v)| p if dist(u, v) = 1, and • |L(u) -L(v)| q if dist(u, v) = 2.</formula><p>The p, q-span of G, denoted by p q (G), is the minimum k for which an L(p, q)-labeling exists. It is easy to see that for any graph G: (G 2 ) = 1 1 (G)+1. The problem of determining p q (G) has been studied for some specific classes of graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">22]</ref>. The motivation for this problem comes from the channel assignment problem in radio and cellular phone systems, where each vertex of the graph corresponds to a transmitter location, with the label assigned to it determining the frequency channel on which it transmits. In applications, because of possible interference between neighboring transmitters, the channels assigned to them must have a certain distance from each other. A similar requirement arises from transmitters that are not neighbors but are close, i.e. at distance 2. This problem is also known as the Frequency Assignment Problem. Because of the motivating application for this problem, it is quite natural to consider it on planar graphs. Since the case q = 0 corresponds to labeling the vertices of a graph with integers such that adjacent vertices receive labels at least p apart, the upper bound 3p for p 0 of planar graphs follows from the Four Color Theorem (if we use colors from {0, p, 2p, 3p}). So let us assume that q 1. For any planar graph G, a straightforward argument shows that p q (G) q + p -q + 1. There are planar graphs G for which p q (G) 3  2 q + O(p, q). The best-known upper bound for p q (G), for a planar graph G, is proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>). For any planar graph G and positive integers p and q, such that p q: p q (G) (4q -2) + 10p + 38q -24.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 1.5 (van den Heuvel and McGuiness</head><p>We sharpen the gap between this result and the best-possible bound asymptotically, by showing that: Theorem 1.6. For any planar graph G and positive integers p and q: p q (G) q 5   3 + 18p + 77q -18.</p><p>Sections 2 and 3 contain the proof of Theorem 1.3. In Section 4 we show how to modify the proof of Theorem 1.3 to prove Theorem 1.4. In Section 5 we explain why any modifications of the lemmas used in the proof of Theorem 1.3 are not sufficient to improve this theorem asymptotically, and one has to come up with a new configuration. These arguments will be cleared later in the paper. We generalize the proof of Theorem 1.3 in Section 6 to prove Theorem 1.6. Finally, in Section 7 we describe an O(n 2 ) time algorithm for finding a coloring as described in Theorems 1.3, 1.4, and 1.6. <ref type="bibr">47</ref>, otherwise we call it a small vertex. From now on we assume that G is a counter-example to Theorem 1.3 with the minimum number of vertices. By a coloring we mean a coloring in which vertices at distance at most two from each other get different colors. Trivially G is connected. Proof. By way of contradiction assume that this is not true. Then there is a 5-vertex v which is adjacent to at most one big vertex and all its other neighbors are 46vertices. Then, using Observation 2.2, v along with one of these small vertices will contradict Lemma 2.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preliminaries</head><formula xml:id="formula_2">A vertex v is called big if d G (v)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">Lemma 2.1. For every vertex v of G, if there exists a vertex u ∈ N(v), such that d G (v) + d G (u) + 2 then d G 2 (v)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">Corollary 2.4. Every vertex of G is a 2-vertex. Lemma 2.5. G is 2-connected.</formula><p>Proof. By contradiction, let v be a cut-vertex of G and let C 1 , . . . , C t (t 2) be the connected components of G -{v}. By the definition of G, for each 1 i t, there is a coloring</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">i of G i = C i ∪ {v} with 5 3</formula><p>+ 78 colors. We can permute the colors in each i (if needed) such that v has the same color in all i 's, and the sets of colors appearing in N G i (v), 1 i t, are all disjoint. Now the union of these colorings will be a coloring of G, a contradiction.</p><p>The proof of Theorem 1.3 becomes significantly simpler if we can assume that the underlying graph is a triangulation, i.e. all faces are triangles, and has minimum degree at least 4. To be able to make these assumptions, we begin by modifying the graph G in two phases.</p><p>Phase 1: In this phase we transform G into a (simple) triangulated graph G , by adding edges to every non-triangle face of G. Let G be initially equal to G. Consider any non-</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">triangle face f = v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k of G . Because G is 2-connected, we cannot have both v 1 v 3 ∈ E(G ) and v 2 v 4 ∈ E(G )</formula><p>at the same time since they both have to be outside of f. So we can add at least one of these edges to E(G ) inside f, without creating any multiple edges. We follow this procedure to reduce the faces' sizes as long as we have any non-triangle face in G . At the end we have a triangulated graph G which contains G as a subgraph. Proof. By Corollary 2.4 and Observation 2.6 all the vertices of G are 2-vertices. Suppose that we have a 2-vertex v in G having neighbors x and y. Since G is triangulated, the faces on each side of edge vx must be triangles, call them f 1 and f 2 . So we must have xy ∈ f 1 and also xy ∈ f 2 . Since G has at least 4 vertices, f 1 = f 2 and so we have a multiple edge. But G is simple.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Lemma 2.8. Each 4-vertex v in G can have at most d(v)</formula><p>2 neighbors which are 3-vertices.</p><p>Proof. Let x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x d G (v)-1 be the sequence of neighbors of v in G , in clockwise order. We show that we cannot have two consecutive 3-vertices in this sequence. If there are two consecutive 3-vertices, say d(x i ) = d(x i+1 ) = 3, where addition is in mod d G (v), then there is a face containing x i-1 , x i , x i+1 , x i+2 . But G is a triangulated graph.</p><p>Phase 2: In this phase we transform graph G into another triangulated graph G , whose minimum degree is at least 4. Initially G is equal to G . As long as there is any 3-vertex v we do the following switching operation: let x, y, z be the three neighbors of v. At least two of them, say x and y, are big in G by Lemma 2.3 and Observation 2.6. Remove edge xy. Since G (and also G ) is triangulated this leaves a face of size 4, say x, v, y, t. Add edge vt to G (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This way, the graph is still triangulated.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Observation 2.9. If v is not a big vertex in G then N G (v) ⊆ N G (v). Lemma 2.10. If v is a big vertex in G then d G (v) 24.</formula><p>Proof. Follows easily from Lemma 2.8 and the definition of the switching operation. So a big vertex v in G will not be a 23-vertex in G . Let v be a big vertex in G and x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x d G (v)-1 be the neighbors of v in G in clockwise order. We call x a , . . . , x a+b (where addition is in mod d G (v)) a sparse segment in G iff:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">• b 2, • Each x i is a 4-vertex.</formula><p>In the next two lemmas, we assume that x a , . . . , x a+b is a maximal sparse segment of v in G , which is not equal to the whole neighborhood of v. Also, we assume that x a-1 and x a+b+1 are the neighbors of v right before x a and right after x a+b , respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 2.11.</head><p>There is a big vertex in G other than v, that is connected to all the vertices of x a+1 , . . . , x a+b-1 , in G (and in G).</p><p>Proof. Follows easily from Observation 2.9, Lemma 2.3, and the definition of a sparse segment.</p><p>We use u to denote the big vertex, other than v, that is connected to all x a+1 , . . . , x a+b-1 .</p><p>Lemma 2.12. All the vertices x a+1 , . . . , x a+b-1 are connected to both u and v in G. If x a-1 is not big in G then x a is connected to both u and v in G. Otherwise it is connected to at least one of them. Similarly if x a+b+1 is not big in G, x b is connected to both u and v in G, and otherwise it is connected to at least one of them.</p><p>Proof. Since the only big neighbors of x a+1 , . . . , x a+b-1 in G are v and u, by Lemma 2.3 they must be connected to both of them in G as well. For the same reason x a and x a+b will be connected to u and v in G, if x a-1 and x a+b-1 are not big.</p><p>We call x a+1 , . . . , x a+b-1 the inner vertices of the sparse segment, and x a and x a+b the end vertices of the sparse segment. Consider vertex v and let us denote the maximal sparse segments of N(v) by Q 1 , Q 2 , . . . , Q m in clockwise order, where Q i = q i,1 , q i,2 , q i,3 , . . . . The next two lemmas are the key lemmas in the proofs of Theorems 1.3 and 1.4. They provide two reducible configurations for a graph that is a minimum counter-example to theorem.</p></div>

Assume that for some i,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">|Q i | &gt; d G (v)-2 3 -73.</formula><p>Let u i be the big vertex that is adjacent to all the inner vertices of Q i (in both G and G ).

Otherwise it is only adjacent to v and u i in G, therefore has degree 2, and so along with v or u i contradicts Lemma 2.1.</p><p>Lemma 2.14. Consider G and suppose that u i and u i+1 are the big vertices adjacent to all the inner vertices of Q i and Q i+1 , respectively. Furthermore, assume that t is a vertex adjacent to both u i and u i+1 but not adjacent to v (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>) and there is a vertex</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">w ∈ N G (t) such that d G (t) + d G (w) + 2. Let X(t) be the set of vertices at distance at most 2 of t that are not in N G [u i ] ∪ N G [u i+1 ]. If |X(t)| 6 then: |Q i | + |Q i+1 | 1 3</formula><p>-67.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof. Again we use contradiction. Assume that |Q</head><formula xml:id="formula_14">i | + |Q i+1 | 1 3</formula><p>-66. Using the argument of the proof of Lemma 2.1 we can color every vertex of G other than t. Note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">d G 2 (t) d G (u i ) + d G (u i+1 ) + |X(t)| 2 + 6. If all the colors of the inner vertices of Q i have appeared on the vertices of N G [u i+1 ] ∪ X(t) -Q i+1 and all the colors of inner vertices of Q i+1 have appeared on the vertices of N G [u i ] ∪ X(t) -Q i then there are at least |Q i | -2 + |Q i+1 | -2 repeated colors at N G 2 (t). So the number of colors at N G 2 (t) is at most 2 + 6 -|Q i | -|Q i+1 | + 4 5 3</formula><p>+ 76 and so there is still one color available for t, which is a contradiction. Therefore, without loss of generality, there exists an inner vertex of Q i+1 , say q i+1,2 , whose color is not in N G [u i ] ∪ X(t) -Q i . If there are less than 5   3   + 77 colors at N G 2 (q i+1,2 ) then we could assign a new color to q i+1,2 and assign the old color of it to t and get a coloring for G. So there must be 5   3   +77 or more different colors at N G 2 (q i+1,2 ). From the definition of a sparse segment N G (q i+1,2 ) ⊆ {v, u i+1 , q i+1,1 , q i+1,3 }. There are at most d G (u i+1 )+7 colors, called the smaller colors, at</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">N G [u i+1 ]∪X(t)∪N G [q i+1,1 ]∪ N G [q i+1,3 ] -{v} -{q i+1,2 } (note that t is not colored). So there must be at least 2 3 + 70 different colors, called the larger colors, at N G [v] -Q i+1 . Since |N G [v]| -|Q i | - |Q i+1 | + 1 -1 3 + 66 2 3</formula><p>+ 67, one of the larger colors must be on an inner vertex of Q i , which without loss of generality, we can assume is q i,2 . Because t is not colored, we must have all the 5   3   + 78 colors at N G 2 (t). Otherwise we could assign a color to t. As there are at most + 6 colors, all from the smaller colors, at N G [u i+1 ] ∪ X(t), all the larger colors must be in N G [u i ], too. Let L be the number of larger colors. Therefore, the number of forbidden colors for q i,2 that are not from the larger colors, is at most</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">d(u i ) -L + d(u i+1 ) -L 2 -2L</formula><p>. By considering the vertices at distance exactly two of q i,2 that have a larger color and noting that q i,2 has a larger color too, the total number of forbidden colors for q i,2 is at most 2 -L 4 3</p><p>-70, and so we can assign a new color to q i,2 and assign the old color of q i,2 , which is one of the larger colors and is not in N G 2 (t) -{q i+1,2 }, to t and extend the coloring to G, a contradiction.</p></div>

A 5-vertex v sends charges as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(11)</ref> If d G (v) = 4 and its neighbors in clockwise order are u 0 , u 1 , u 2 , u 3 , such that u 0 , u 1 , u 2 are big in G and u 3 is small, then v sends 1 2 to each of u 0 and u 2 through</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">u 1 .

From now on, by "the total charge sent from v to one of its neighbors u", we mean the total charge sent from v to u or through u. Similarly, by "the total charge v received from u", we mean the total charge sent from or through u to v. Proof. If u 2 is big and one of rules 3 or 5 applies then it is easy to verify that it is the only rule by which u 2 gets charge from v. If u 1 and u 3 are both 5-vertices then rule 5 may apply twice, one for sending charge to a neighbor of u 1 and one for sending charge to a neighbor of u 3 , so overall u 2 gets at most 1 2 from v. It is straightforward to check that there is no configuration in which we can apply rule 3 twice.</p><p>The only other way for v to send charge to u 2 is by rule 4. Note that if this rule applies then none of the other rules apply. Also, v can send charge to u 2 twice by rule 4 since it might apply under clockwise and counter-clockwise orientations of neighbors of v. This happens if d G (u 0 ) = 5, 5 d G (u 1 ) 6, 5 d G (u 3 ) 6, d G (u 4 ) = 5, v, u 1 , x 2 , x 1 , x 0 are neighbors of u 0 in clockwise order where d G (x 0 ) = 4, and y 0 , y 1 , y 2 , u 3 , v are neighbors of u 4 in clockwise order where d G (y 0 ) = 4. In this case v sends 1  2 to x 1 through</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">y i x i z i u i,1 u i,l i x i+1 z i+1 y i+1 v Fig. 5.

This proves the lemma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 3.3. Every vertex v that is not big in G will have non-negative charge.</head><p>Proof. By Lemma 2.3 every 4-vertex gets a total of at least 2 units of charge by rule 1 and each 5-vertex gets a total of at least 1 unit of charge by rule 2. Also, the 5-vertices that send charges by rules 11 and 12 will have non-negative charges, since they are adjacent to at least three 12-vertices. If d G (v) 12 then it sends 1  2 d G (v) d G (v) -6 by rule 10 and so will have non-negative charge. It is straightforward to verify that there is no configuration in which a 7-vertex v sends more than 1 unit of charge in rule 8 or 9. Finally, it is not difficult to see that by rule 8 and 9, a vertex sends at most 1  2 for every two neighbors that it has. So if 8 d G (v) &lt; 12 it sends at most</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">d G (v) 4</formula><p>d G (v) -6, and therefore it will have non-negative charge in any of these cases. Finally, rules 3-7 do not apply to the vertices that are not big in G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 3.4. Every big vertex v that is not pseudo-big will have non-negative charge.</head><p>Proof. Suppose that v is such a vertex. So d G (v) d G (v)-12 and therefore v was involved in at least 12 switching operations, in each of which the edge between v and another big vertex of G was removed. Since G is simple, these big vertices are distinct. Call them y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y k , where k 12, in clockwise order. Let x i z i be the edge that was added during the switching operation that removed vy i , and the order of x i 's and z i 's is such that x i comes before z i in clockwise order. Note that all x i 's and all z i 's are neighbors of v in G (see Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p><p>Let us call the vertices between z i and x i+1 , u i,1 , u i,2 , . . . , u i,l i , starting from z i . For consistency, let us relabel temporarily z i and x i+1 to u i,0 and u i,l i +1 , respectively. Recall that k 12 and v sends a total of no more than 1 to any vertex. Thus, in order to show that v sends no more than its initial charge of d G (v) -6, it is enough to show that for each 1 i k, either (a) v sends a total of at most 1  2 to a vertex from z i to x i+1 ; or (b) v sends a total of at most l i+1 + 1 to the l i+1 + 2 vertices from z i+1 to x i+2 . First we show that there is at least one 5-vertex in u i,0 , . . . , u i,l i +1 , for each 1 i k. If u i,0 is a 4-vertex we must have y i u i,1 ∈ G , because G is a triangulation. Assuming that u i,1 is a 4-vertex we must have y i u i,2 ∈ G and so on, until we have y i+1 u i,l i +1 ∈ G and so u i,l i +1 will be a 5-vertex. So for every 1 i k, there is a 5-vertex between z i and x i+1 ; take any such vertex and call it u i,j i . By Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 and rule 10, it can be seen that v sends a total of at most 1  2 to u i,j i , unless 7 d G (u i,j i ) 11. So assume that 7 d G (u i,j i ) 11 and v sends 1 through u i,j i . By Lemma 3.2 both of the neighbors of v before and after u i,j i are 5-or 6-vertices and so to each of them v sends a total of at most 1  2 . If z i = x i+1 then at least one of these lies between z i and x i+1 and therefore we satisfy (a) above.</p><p>So we can assume z i = x i+1 . Thus u i,j i = z i = x i+1 , and so (i) 5 d G (z i+1 ) 6, and (ii) 1  2 from z i+1 by rule 12 and so sends a total of at most 0 to it. If d G (z i+1 ) = 6 then it is easy to verify that v sends nothing to z i+1 by any rule and so sends a total of at most 0 to it. Either way, we satisfy (b), above.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">d G (u i+1,1 ) = 5 if z i+1 = x i+2 , or d G (z i+2 ) = 5 otherwise. First assume that z i+1 = x i+2 .

Assume that v is a pseudo-big vertex of G whose neighborhood sequence in clockwise order is x 1 , . . . , x k .

Since R does not overlap with any maximal sparse segment, from every three consecutive vertices x i , x i+1 , x i+2 in R (where we consider the neighbors cyclicly if R = N G (v)), at least one of them is a 5-vertex.

So v is sending a total of at most 0, so far. Let t be the other vertex that makes a triangle with edge u i u i+1 . Assume that d G (t) = 4, and w 1 , w 2 are the two neighbors of t other than u i and u i+1 . If d G (w 1 ) 4 and d G (w 2 ) 4 then since Q i and Q i+1 are sparse segments and u i and u i+1 are big vertices in G, by Lemma 2.14 Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">2</ref>) holds. Otherwise, assume that d G (w 1 ) 5. Then by rule 3 u i will be sending extra 1  2 to v through u. So overall, v sends a total of -1 2 to u. If d G (t) 5 then each of u i and u i+1 will send an extra 1  4 to v through u by rule 5 and therefore v sends a total of -1 2 to u. Now assume d G (u) = 6 and that the neighbors of u are v, u i , u i+1 , t and the end vertices of Q i and Q i+1 . Note that in this case v will send nothing to u. Assume that d G (t) = 4 and its other neighbor is w. If d G (w) 6 then by Lemma 2.14 Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">2</ref>) holds.

If d G (t) 6 then both u i and u i+1 send an extra 1  4 charge to v through u by rule 7. So v sends a total of -1 2 to u. If 7 d G (u) 11, or 12 d G (u) and u was not big in G, then u sends 1  2 to v by rule 8 or 10 and so v sends a total of -1 2 to u.

We prove the following theorem: Proof. Analogous to the proof of Lemma 2.13.</p><p>The next lemma is analogous to Lemma 2.14. The key difference is that we require a bound on the degree of t. This is because each vertex adjacent to t can forbid for t up to 2p-1 colors. Thus we have to be more careful about controlling the number of such vertices. Lemma 6.6. Suppose that u i and u i+1 are the big vertices adjacent to all the vertices of Q i and Q i+1 , respectively. Furthermore, assume that t is a 6-vertex adjacent to both u i and u i+1 but not adjacent to v (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>) and there is a vertex w ∈ N(t) such that d G (t) + d G (w) + 2. Let X(t) be the set of vertices at distance at most two of t that are not in</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">N [u i ] ∪ N [u i+1 ]. If |X(t)| 6 then |Q i | + |Q i+1 | 1 3 -60.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Proof. Again, by way of contradiction, assume that</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">|Q i | + |Q i+1 |<label>1 3</label></formula><p>-59. Using the same argument as at the beginning of the proof of Lemma 6.2, we can color every vertex of G other than t using colors in {0, . . . , C -1} such that the vertices that are adjacent receive colors that are at least p apart and the vertices at distance two receive distinct colors. Consider such a coloring.</p><p>Note. We often focus on the inner vertices of Q i . So recall that there are exactly |Q i | -2 such vertices (similarly for Q i+1 ). Also, for a set S of vertices each of which has a color, we sometimes use "the colors in S" to refer to the set of colors that appear on the vertices of S.</p><p>We say that a vertex u ∈ N G 2 (w) forbids a color for w if either (i) u is a distance 2 from w and u has colour or (ii) u is adjacent to w and u has a colour that differs from by less than p; i.e., if an assignment of to w would create a conflict with the colour on u. A set S of vertices forbids a set T of colours for w if for each colour ∈ T , some vertex in S forbids for w. A colour is forbidden for w if some u ∈ N G 2 (w) forbids it for w. Claim 1. There are at least 5   3   + 78 colors in N G 2 (t) and N G 2 (t) forbids all the C colors for t.</p><p>Proof. Trivially, if there is a non-forbidden color for t then we can extend the coloring to t, which contradicts the minimality of G.</p><p>If there are at most 5   3   + 77 colors in N G 2 (t) then (because t is not colored and has degree at most 6) they forbid at most 5 Claim 2. There exists an inner vertex of Q i or Q i+1 whose color is distinct from the color of every other vertex in N G 2 (t) and differs from the color of every vertex in N(t) by at least p. So, SF contains S along with at most 18(p -1) colors which differ from the color of some neighbor of t or some neighbor of q i+1,2 by at most p -1.</p><p>Claim 5. Every color that is not in SF differs from every color in N(t) ∪ N(q i+1,2 ) by at least p.</p><p>Proof. By the definition of SF, every color which differs from the color of a vertex in N(t) ∪ N(q i+1,2 ) by less than p is in SF.</p><p>We will use Claim 5 at the end of the proof of this Lemma. By Claim 3, there are at least C -1 -|SF | colors, different from the smaller forbidden colors, in N(v) -Q i+1 . We call this set the larger colors and denote it by L. Claim 6. |L| + 61 &lt; |L|, one of the larger colors must be on an inner vertex of Q i , which without loss of generality, we can assume is q i,2 .</p><p>Claim 7. The vertices in N(v) -Q i+1 -{q i,2 } forbid for q i,2 all the colors in L, except the one that appears on q i,2 .</p><p>Proof. All the larger colors appear in N(v) -Q i+1 and so they are at distance at most two of q i,2 .</p><p>Claim 8. The number of forbidden colors for q i,2 is at most 4   3   + 8p -68 &lt; C.</p><p>Proof. By noting that d(q i,2 ) 4, neighbors of q i,2 forbid at most 4(2p -1) colors for q i,2 . Now let us count the number of forbidden colors for q i,2 by the vertices at distance exactly two of it.</p><p>N[u i+1 ] ∪ N(t) ∪ X(t) forbids for t only colors that are in SF. Thus, by Claim 1, all the larger colors must appear in N [u i ] -N(t). Remember that the larger colors appear in N(v) -Q i+1 , too. Therefore, the number of colors that are not in L and are forbidden for q i,2 by the vertices at distance exactly 2 of q i,2 is at most: d(u i ) -1 -(|L| -1) + d(v) -1 -(|L| -1) 2 -2|L|. By considering the vertices at distance exactly two of q i,2 that have a larger color and noting that q i,2 has a larger color too, and using Claim 6, the total number of colors forbidden for q i,2 is at most By Claim 8, we can produce a valid labelling of G by assignning the color of q i,2 to t (because it is a larger color and so it is different from the colors in X(t) and, by Claim 5, That this algorithm works follows easily from the proofs of Lemmas 3.3, 3.4, and 3.7. Since in a planar graph the number of edges and faces is linear in the number of vertices we may let n = |V | be the size of the graph. Finding a cut-vertex in a graph takes linear time. To see if there is a 5-vertex with less than 2 big neighbors we spend at most O(n) time. Also, applying the initial charges and the discharging rules takes O(n) time. After finding a vertex with negative charge, finding the suitable edge and then contracting it can be done in O(n). Since there are O(n) iterations of the main procedure, the total running time of the algorithm would be O(n 2 ).</p><p>The algorithms for Theorems 1.4 and 1.6 work almost identically.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Observation 2 . 6 .Lemma 2 . 7 .</head><label>2627</label><figDesc>For every vertex v, N G (v) ⊆ N G(v).

Noting that p q p+q-1 q yields q(c -1) q 5   3 + 18p + 77q -18 which in turn completes the proof.</p><p>In the rest of this section we give the proof of Theorem 6.1. The steps of the proof are very similar to those of proof of Theorem 1.3. Let G be a planar graph which is a counter-example to Theorem 6.1 with the minimum number of vertices. We set</p><p>and throughout this section we use colors from {0, . . . , C -1}. Recall that a vertex is said to be big if d G (v) 47.</p><p>Proof.

The resulting graph has maximum degree at most and because G was a minimum counter-example, the new graph has an L(p, 1)-labeling with at most C colors. Now consider such a labeling induced on G, in which every vertex other than v is colored. Every vertex at distance (exactly) two of v in G forbids one color for v, and every vertex in N(v) forbids at most 2p -1 colors for v. So the total number of forbidden colors for v, i.e. the colors that we cannot assign to v, is at most</p><p>The last inequality follows from the assumption that p 1. Therefore, there is still at least one color available for v whose absolute difference from its neighbors in G 2 is large enough and so we can extend the coloring to G. Observation 6.3. By Theorem 1.5 we can assume that 162, otherwise (4q -2) + 10p + 38q -24 C -1 (with q = 1). Lemma 6.4. Every 5-vertex must be adjacent to at least 2 big vertices.</p><p>Proof. By way of contradiction assume that there is a 5-vertex v which is adjacent to at most one big vertex and so all its other neighbors are 46-vertices. Then, using Observation 6.3, v along with one of these small vertices will contradict Lemma 6.2. Now construct graph G from G and then G from G in the same way we did in the proof of Theorem 1.3. Also, we define the sparse segments in the same way. Consider vertex v and let us call the maximal sparse segments of it Q 1 , Q 2 , . . . , Q m in clockwise order, where Q i = q i,1 , q i,2 , q i,3 , . . . . Proof. By way of contradiction assume the above statement is false. Let us count the number of forbidden colors for t. The neighbors of t forbid at most d G (t) × (2p -1) colors for t. Let us denote this set of forbidden colors by R. The vertices at distance exactly two of t are in N(u i ) ∪ N(u i+1 ) ∪ X(t) -N(t), and each of them forbids its own color for t. However, by assumption, at least |Q i | -2 + |Q i+1 | -2 of these forbidden colors (for t) are counted twice. This is because we assumed the claim is false; i.e. for every color that appears on an inner vertex of Q i or Q i+1 there is a neighbor of t whose color differs from by less than p (and so ∈ R) or there is another vertex in N G 2 (t) with color . Since</p><p>Thus, without loss of generality, we can assume there exists an inner vertex of Q i+1 , say q i+1,2 , whose color is different from the color of every vertex in N G 2 (t) and differs from the color of every vertex in N(t) by at least p. Claim 3. There are at least 5   3   + 77 colors in N G 2 (q i+1,2 ) and they forbid for q i+1,2 , C -1 colors (all the colors except the one that appears on q i+1,2 ).</p><p>Proof. First we show that the vertices in N G 2 (q i+1,2 ) must forbid all the colors (except the one that appears on q i+1,2 ) for q i+1,2 . Otherwise, we can produce a valid labelling of G by removing the color of q i+1,2 and assigning it to t, and then assigning a new color to q i+1,2 (from the other colors that are not forbidden for it). Hence, the number of forbidden colors for q i+1,2 must be C -1.</p><p>If there are fewer than 5   3   + 77 different colors in N G 2 (q i+1,2 ) then, since d G (q i+1,2 ) 4, the vertices in N G 2 (q i+1,2 ) forbid fewer than 4(2p -1) + 5 3</p><p>This contradicts what we proved in the previous paragraph.</p><p>From the definition of a sparse segment N(q i+1,2 ) ⊆ {v, u i+1 , q i+1,1 , q i+1,3 }.

Follows from the definition of S.</p><p>3 ] is of distance at most 2 from either t or q i+1,2 , and therefore forbids some colors for t or for q i+1,2 . Let us call the set of colors that are forbidden for t or q i+1,2 by those vertices the smaller forbidden colors, and denote them by SF. Since d(t) 6 and d(q i+1,2 ) 4 and u i+1 is a common neighbor of t and q i+1,2 ,</p><p>differs from all the colors in N(t) by at least p) and then finding a new color for q i,2 that is not forbidden for it. This completes the proof of Lemma 6.6. The rest of the proof is almost identical to that of Theorem 1.3. We use Lemmas 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6, instead of Lemmas 2.3, 2.13, and 2.14, respectively. The initial charges and the discharging rules are the same. Without any modifications, Lemmas 3.1-3.5 hold in this case, too. In Lemma 3.6 we should replace Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) with Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and use Lemma 6.6 instead of Lemma 2.14. To do so, it is important to note that whenever we used Lemma 2.14 in the proof of Lemma 3.6, the degree of t was at most 6; thus, we can use Lemma 6.6, instead. After doing these modifications, the calculations for the proof of this revised version of Lemma 3.6 are fairly straightforward.</p></div>
