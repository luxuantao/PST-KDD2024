<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Given a 3D mesh, many computer graphics applications map texture onto it in order to produce more realistic renderings. Since the texture map is typically a 2D image, this operation requires assigning 2D plane coordinates to each of the mesh vertices. This is a planar parametrization or embedding of the mesh. If the mesh consists of triangles, the texture pixels are then mapped in a piecewise affine manner from the texture plane to the 3D triangle faces. Since a texture map is topologically equivalent to a disk, the most natural result is obtained when the 3D mesh also has the topology of a disk (i.e. manifold, genus-0 with a boundary). Many such parametrizations exist, each a distorted version of the 3D mesh. <ref type="figure">--------------------------------------------</ref>Hence the challenge is to produce a planar triangulation that best matches the geometry of the 3D mesh, minimizing some measure of distortion, yet is still valid. In this context, valid means that the individual planar triangles are disjoint and do not overlap. Most of the recent works on the subject of parametrization (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>) have focused on defining the distortion, and showing how to minimize it. The different parametrization methods published may be classified into two categories: Those that require that the boundary parameter values be pre-defined and form a convex shape (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>) and those who impose no special shape on the boundary (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>).</p><p>While parametrizing to the plane is the most natural way to perform texture-mapping, this is less natural for other mesh processing operations which also require a parametrization. For applications such as morphing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and remeshing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> it is best to parametrize the mesh over a domain which is topologically equivalent to it. This significantly reduces the distortion introduced by the parametrization, allowing successful manipulation or resampling of the mesh geometry. So if the mesh has the topology of a sphere, it is best to use a spherical parameter domain. Parametrizing a 3D triangle mesh over the sphere is equivalent to embedding its connectivity graph on the sphere, such that all the resulting spherical triangles do not overlap. A classical result due to Steinitz is that a graph may be embedded on the sphere if and only if it is planar and 3-connected. Thus a closed genus-0 triangulation can always be mapped to a spherical triangulation, which is a triangulation on the sphere, such that the edges are geodesics forming non-overlapping spherical triangles.</p><p>The simplest way to map a closed triangulation to the sphere is to reduce the problem to the planar case. First cut out one triangle to serve as a boundary. Then parametrize the resulting open mesh over the unit triangle using any planar parametrization method, and finally use the inverse stereo projection to map the plane to the sphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The boundary triangle will contain the north pole of the sphere. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. The main problem with this method is that most planar parametrization methods, when faced with a tri-angular boundary (containing only three vertices), tend to cluster all the interior vertices in the center of the triangle, leading to significant distortion in both the planar and spherical parametrizations. Another problem is that, although the inverse stereo projection is conformal, namely, preserves angles in the continuous case, it does not preserve angles precisely in the discrete case. It also certainly does not preserve other geometric properties that the planar triangulation might have had. Beyond this, the identity and exact position of the bounding triangle in the plane will affect the spherical result significantly, so a considerable amount of trial and error is required to produce a satisfactory result (e.g. such that the vertices are distributed well over the sphere). A more elaborate boundary may be formed by cutting along mesh edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. This, however, usually introduces discontinuities where the edges are cut and does not eliminate distortion entirely.</p><p>Another straightforward method to parametrize to the sphere is to cut the mesh into two pieces, each topologically equivalent to a disk, parametrize each over a planar disk with a common boundary, and then map each disk to a hemisphere (by adding an appropriate z component to each vertex). The common boundary guarantees that the two hemispheres fit together at the equator. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>. Since this boundary will presumably contain more than just three vertices, each of the two disk parametrizations will be less distorted than the one obtained by using a single triangle as the boundary, so the spherical result will also be less distorted. However, the result will depend strongly on the specific cut used to obtain the two disks, so it can be difficult to optimize. In addition the cut will show up as a parameterization artifact. This method may be extended by cutting the given mesh into more than two pieces <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. It is most natural to parametrize a mesh directly on the sphere without reducing to the planar case. Several methods for direct parametrization on the sphere have been developed. The only one to date that seems to guarantee a valid spherical triangulation (i.e. with no triangle foldovers) is that of Shapiro and Tal <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, similar to that of Das and Goodrich <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This method works by simplifying the mesh by vertex removal until only a tetrahedron remains. The tetrahedron is easily embedded on the sphere, and then the vertices are inserted back one by one, so that the validity of the triangulation is preserved throughout the process. While this is quite an efficient process, it is difficult to optimize the parametrization, due to its greedy nature, and impossible to steer it to have any desirable mathematical properties. Other direct parametrization methods were proposed by Kobbelt et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Alexa <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These are heuristic iterative procedures, attempting to converge to a valid parametrization by applying local improvement (relaxation) rules. These work well in many cases, but there is no guarantee that they will terminate, and, even if they do, that the resulting embedding will be valid, or have any desirable mathematical properties. A method which guarantees a valid embedding was recently proposed by Sheffer et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. This is a highly non-linear optimization procedure, working with the angles of the spherical triangulation (as opposed to the vertex positions), inspired by the angle-based method of Sheffer and de Sturler <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for planar parametrizations. So far it lacks an efficient numerical computation procedure, so it is not very practical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Our contribution</head><p>The problem of mesh parametrization is a problem of mapping a piecewise linear surface with a discrete representation onto a continuous spherical surface. The theory of mappings between various Riemann surfaces is well understood in the continuous case using classical differential geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Probably the most notable example of this is the so-called conformal mapping theory which shows how to map any continuous Riemann surface to another such that angles are preserved. However, the discrete case of meshes is much less understood. In the limit it obviously converges to the continuous case, but in practical applications the meshes involved may be far from this limit. Hence there is a need to treat the discrete case separately in a combinatorial manner, albeit inspired by the classical theory. This paper introduces a precise mathematical characterization of all possible spherical parametrizations of a closed genus-0 triangle mesh. We show that it is a natural non-linear extension of the linear theory of barycentric coordinates used in the planar case. The correctness of this methodology is proved by establishing a link to the so-called Colin de Verdiere matrices associated with planar graphs. We also describe an efficient numerical method for generating and controlling these parametrizations.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the method of barycentric coordinates and its extension to the spherical case. Section 3 proves the correctness of this theory using recent results from spectral graph theory. Section 4 discusses the various degrees of freedom present in the spherical embedding space. Section 5 describes numerical methods for computing spherical parametrizations. We illustrate with some experimental results in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Method of Barycentric Coordinates</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The planar case</head><p>Floater <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> described a generic method to embed a manifold 3D mesh with a boundary in the plane without foldovers. Floater's method is a generalization of the basic procedure originally proposed by Tutte <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for a planar graph, which can be traced back as far as I. Fary in 1948 and J.C. Maxwell in 1864. This method makes use of so-called barycentric coordinates (or convex combinations) and proceeds as follows:</p><p>1. To each interior (directed) edge e = (i,j), assign a positive weight w ij , such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 ) ( = ∑ ∈ i N j ij w</formula><p>where N(i) is the list of vertices neighboring the i'th vertex.</p><p>2. To all other entries (i,j), assign w ij = 0. 4. Solve the following two linear systems for the x and y coordinates of the n interior vertices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y x b y W I b x W I = - = - ) ( , ) (</formula><p>, where W is a nxn matrix containing w ij , and b x and b y vectors with non-zero entries corresponding to vertices adjacent to the boundary.</p><p>The cornerstone of this theory is the following theorem, first proven by Tutte <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and reproven over the years in different ways (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">25 Chap 3]</ref>):</p><p>Theorem 1: Given a planar 3-connected graph with a boundary fixed to a convex shape, the positions of the interior vertices form a planar triangulation (i.e. none of the triangles overlap) if and only if each vertex position is some convex combination of its neighbor's positions.</p><p>Theorem 1 implies that the method of barycentric coordinates generates all possible valid embeddings of the graph in the plane, given the (convex) positions of the boundary. Tutte proposed using w ij =1/deg(i) for all edges (i,j), in effect placing each interior vertex at the centroid of its neighbors (deg(i) is the degree, or valence of the i'th vertex). This choice of W does not take into account the geometry of the mesh, just its connectivity. When the mesh is given with 3D geometry, a number of recipes for W have been proposed, each aiming for some effect related to reflecting the geometry of the mesh in the parametrization, namely, minimizing its metric distortion when flattened to the plane. The most popular methods seem to be the shape-preserving method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the conformal, or harmonic method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> and the mean-value method <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. These methods all have the desirable 2D reproduction property <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, namely that when applied to a 2D triangulation, the embedding procedure will produce an output identical to the input. However, some of the methods, most notably the conformal method, do not always result in positive weights, hence cannot guarantee a valid embedding.</p><p>In general, the method of barycentric coordinates may be formulated as the solution to the 2D vector Laplace equation on the interior vertices: (1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">b x L W =</formula><p>with boundary conditions derived from the convex boundary vertex positions, which prevents the trivial zero solution. This is a linear system. L W = I-W is the general normalized Laplacian operator, general because the weights of W are arbitrary positive values, and normalized because the rows of W all sum to unity. The special case of w ij =1/deg(i) proposed by Tutte will be called the Tutte Laplacian.</p><p>A simple numerical procedure to solve (1) is a relaxation procedure, where the boundary vertices are placed on a convex boundary, and the interior vertices repeatedly updated to be at the weighted average of their neighboring vertices positions, as dictated by W. Since L W is diagonally dominant, this Gauss-Seidel procedure is guaranteed to converge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The spherical case</head><p>Note that L W has unit diagonal, negative entries for each mesh edge, and vanishes otherwise. Also, all rows sum to zero, hence L W is singular. L W is, however, not symmetric. In what follows, we restrict the discussion to the class of symmetric Laplacians, which corresponds to sets of barycentric coordinates which are edge-symmetric up to normalization of each row. These are: Note that the Tutte Laplacian is symmetric. Its symmetric version is the matrix with -1's at entries corresponding to edges, and the vertex degrees along the diagonal. Symmetric systems such as these can be given the physical interpretation of a mass-spring system at rest, where the vertices are point masses joined by springs along the edges. In this case, the Laplace equations are just the normal equations for minimizing the quadratic spring energy. Tutte and conformal barycentric coordinates have the symmetry property, but mean value coordinates unfortunately do not.</p><p>Generalizing the barycentric coordinates theory to spherical embeddings is not straightforward. Being non-planar, it will be impossible in general to express a vertex on the sphere as a convex combination of its neighbors (e.g. if a vertex's neighbors are all co-planar, this will imply that the vertex should also be on the same plane).</p><p>Inspired by classical differential geometry operator theory, Gu and Yau <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proposed to embed a mesh on a curved 3D surface using the generalization of the Laplacian to the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Intuitively, this is just the tangential component of the Laplacian at that point of the surface. Namely, they propose to embed a closed manifold genus-0 mesh on the unit sphere by defining a Laplacian operator L W as in the planar case, and solving the following non-linear system:</p><p>(2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">n i x t s x L i W ,.., 1 , 1 . . 0 || = = =</formula><p>where L || is the tangential component of L. The right hand side of (2) is zero, as opposed to the non-zero b in (1), because there is no boundary. However, Gu and Yau did not prove that these are indeed necessary and sufficient conditions to obtain a spherical triangulation in the discrete case, and did not translate (2) to a set of explicit equations for the vertex coordinates on the sphere. See Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> for a geometric interpretation of (2): the vector difference between the i'th vertex and the weighted average (as dictated by L) of its neighbors is collinear with the vector difference between the vertex and the sphere's center. The latter vector's length is unit, and the former's α i . This may be posed as the following set of 4n quadratic equations on the 3n positions of the vertices (x i , y i , z i ) and the n auxiliary variables α i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">n i z i L z n i y i L y n i x i L x n i z y x W i i W i i W i i i i i ,.., 1 0 ] [ ,.., 1 0 ] [ ,.., 1 0 ] [ ) 3 ( ,.., 1 1 2 2 2 = = - = = - = = - = = + + α α α L W [i]</formula><p>denotes the i'th row of the matrix L W , and x, y, and z are column vectors. n is the number of vertices in the mesh. </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">       = &gt; ∉ ∈ &lt; - = ∑ = j i j i E j i E j i j i k i L i j L number negative j i L n k W W W ) , ( ) ,<label>( , ) , ( ) , ( 0 )</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Correctness</head><p>While Gu and Yau showed that solving (2) results in a one-to-one embedding of a continuous Riemann surface on the sphere, they did not show that this also holds for the discrete case of a piecewise-linear mesh, in the sense that the result is a valid spherical triangulation. We now show how some recent deep results in spectral graph theory may be applied to establish this, manifesting in the following analog of Theorem 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 2: Given a planar 3-connected graph, the positions of the vertices form a spherical triangulation (i.e. none of the spherical triangles overlap) if and only if each vertex position is some convex combination of the positions of its neighbors, which is then projected on the sphere.</head><p>Theorem 2 means that the barycentric coordinate theory holds also on the sphere up to a radial residual, consistent with (2) and (3). In the following sections we will prove this theorem. We start with some preliminaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Colin de Verdiere number</head><p>In 1990, Colin de Verdiere <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> established an algebraic invariant for certain families of graphs. Given a n-vertex graph G = &lt;V,E&gt;, consider the class M(G) of symmetric matrices with element M ij such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">j i E j i E j i anything number negative M ij = ∉ ∈      = ) , ( ) , (<label>0</label></formula><p>Note that M(G) is a superset of the symmetric Laplacians for G, allowing the diagonal entries to assume arbitrary values (so that the rows do not necessarily sum to zero). Denote by λ(M) = {λ 0 ,.., λ n-1 } the spectrum of M with corresponding eigenvectors {ξ 0 ,.., ξ n-1 }. Let r = r(G) be the maximal integer such that λ 1 =λ 2 =..=λ r over all matrices in M(G). Let M be a matrix which attains this maximum. This r(G) is called the Colin de Verdiere (CdV) number of G, the matrix M a CdV matrix for G, its r identical eigenvalues CdV eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenvectors CdV eigenvectors. Colin de Verdiere showed that: G is a 3-connected planar graph if and only if r(G) = 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Connection to spectral graph theory</head><p>An important extension of the results of Colin de Verdiere was obtained by Lovasz and Schrijver <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, who showed that CdV eigenvectors of a graph G may be used to embed G in R r . For the special case r(G) = 3, this translates to: G describes the edges of a convex polyhedron in 3D containing the origin when the three eigenvectors ξ 1 , ξ 2 and ξ 3 of a CdV matrix of G are used as coordinate vectors for its vertices.</p><p>The fact that the polyhedron is convex and contains the origin is a key fact, since convexity implies star-shapedness. This in turn implies that by normalizing the vertices, the polyhedron may be projected onto the unit sphere to form a (valid) spherical triangulation.</p><p>Since the spectrum of a matrix may be shifted arbitrarily by adding an appropriate constant to the diagonal entries, we may assume, without loss of generality, that the three CdV eigenvalues are zero. Thus the corresponding CdV matrix has just one negative eigenvalue and co-rank 3. In this case the three CdV eigenvectors are independent non-trivial solutions to what looks like Laplace equations: Mx = 0.</p><p>Using eigenvectors of matrices as coordinate vectors for embedding graphs is not new. The traditional way of doing this is taking the eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest positive eigenvalues of the Tutte Laplacian (the smallest eigenvalue is zero, due to this matrix being singular). This dates back to Fiedler <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Hall <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for a discussion on the different ways of using the Laplacian for "drawing" graphs. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Tutte Laplacian of a graph are the cornerstone of spectral graph theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and have also been used for coding 3D mesh geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, the embeddings resulting from eigenvectors of this Laplacian do not have very appealing geometric properties, and, specifically, the triangles overlap. The Colin de Verdiere theory reveals that more powerful generalizations of the Laplacian must be used, resulting in eigenvectors which are more "symmetric", since they correspond to identical eigenvalues. On an intuitive level, this symmetry guarantees the validity of the embedding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Generating spherical triangulations</head><p>It is difficult to use the Colin de Verdiere theory directly to embed on a sphere, since, given a 3-connected planar graph G, there is no easy recipe to generate a CdV matrix for G. However we will now show that solving (3) is equivalent to generating such a matrix, hence also guarantees a spherical triangulation. This is the key observation of this paper.</p><p>Assume that L is a symmetric Laplacian for G and that (3) has been solved for column n-vectors x, y, z and α. This means that the i'th row</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L[i] of L satisfies L[i](x, y, z) = α i (x i , y i , z i ). Define the matrix M as:    = - ≠ = j i L j i L M i ii ij ij α , obtaining M(x, y, z) = 0.</formula><p>Hence M is a CdV matrix for G with vanishing CdV eigenvalue and CdV eigenvectors x, y and z, implying that x,y,z form a valid spherical triangulation when used as coordinate vectors.</p><p>A similar argument shows the converse: If the three vectors (x,y,z) are a spherical triangulation of a 3-connected planar graph G, then these three vectors span the nullspace of a suitable CdV matrix M, which may easily be translated into L and α satisfying (3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The Solution Space</head><p>In the planar case, once the boundary of the triangulation has been fixed and the barycentric coordinates chosen, the positions of the interior vertices are uniquely determined. However, this is not the case for the spherical scenario, and this poses a number of interesting questions. We elaborate on these in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Existence</head><p>Steinitz's theorem guarantees that any planar 3-connected mesh has a valid spherical triangulation. The theory of Colin de Verdiere guarantees that if a valid spherical triangulation exists, then it can be found by solving a system of the form (3). Indeed, Lovasz <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> has described a construction for the appropriate CdV matrix, hence symmetric Laplacian, for a given convex embedding of a triangulation. However, there is no guarantee that an arbitrary symmetric Laplacian, when used in (2), will result in a non-degenerate triangulation, as described in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Degrees of freedom</head><p>It is easy to see that any solution to (3) must satisfy α≥0. The case α=0 is the trivial solution when all vertices degenerate to one point on the sphere. Gu and Yau <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> tried to prevent this by adding the equation ∑ = = n i i x 1 0 to the system. However, this is damaging and can prevent other non-degenerate solutions. Another degenerate solution can occur when the vertices are mapped to two antipodal points on the sphere. Here too most of the α i will vanish. In this case, the vertices are partitioned into two sets such that the weighted average of the neighbors of a vertex in each set is still in the same hemisphere as the vertex. A more interesting situation can occur if the connectivity graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle. The cycle of vertices may then be mapped to the equator. In this case, the connectivity graph is just the union of two outerplanar graphs (triangulated polygons) with identical boundaries, and the resulting spherical triangles will straddle entire hemispheres.</p><p>Beyond the degenerate solutions, a solution to (3) is not unique, since any spherical triangulation is certainly invariant to the rotation group SO(3), which immediately gives three degrees of freedom. However, there seem to be even more degrees of freedom. This can be seen by examining the simple special cases of a tetrahedral mesh combined with the Tutte Laplacian. Observe that any rectangular parallelpiped circumscribed by the unit sphere defines an equifaced tetrahedron (i.e. a tetrahedron whose four faces are identical), by taking its edges to be the opposite diagonals of the six faces of the parallelpiped (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Now it is easy to see that any vertex of the tetrahedron is collinear with the origin and the centroid of the three opposite vertices. This means that the vertex locations on the sphere satisfy (3) with α i = 4/3 for 1≤ i ≤4. There are two degrees of freedom in constructing such a rectangular parallelpiped, so all together there are five degrees of freedom. We have not been able to prove that there are more, but we conjecture that in total there are actually six degrees of freedom in every solution to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, similarly to the planar case. Another indication that there might actually be six degrees of freedom is in analogy to the family of conformal mappings in the plane, which are equivalent to the Moebius group <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, having six degrees of freedom. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows two spherical triangulations of a mesh, both satisfying (2) with the Tutte Laplacian. It is easy to see that they are not rotationally equivalent because the lengths of the edges of corresponding spherical triangles are not identical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Numerical Methods</head><p>In order to solve the nonlinear set of equations (3) for very large meshes, it is important to have a stable and efficient numerical procedure. It does not suffice to require that a convex combination type of relationship between the vertices holds even approximately, for example, in the least-squares sense while all vertices are constrained to lie on the sphere. This will not prevent the vertices collapsing to one point. Similarly, a relaxation procedure where each vertex is updated to be the weighted average of its neighbors, and then projected onto the sphere, will not converge to the desired result, rather collapse to some degenerate configuration. Gu and Yau <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> described a numerical procedure to solve (2), based on a steepest descent procedure, but it is not clear from their description why it should converge to a valid solution.</p><p>We use the fsolve procedure of MATLAB, a subspace trust region procedure based on the interior-reflective Newton method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Each iteration involves the approximate solution of a large linear system using the method of preconditioned conjugate gradients. To help this method converge quickly, it is helpful to provide a good initial guess for the geometry (x i , y i , z i ) and the auxiliary α i . It is easy to see that α i is related to the curvature at the i'th vertex, and since the total curvature is fixed, α i should be initialized to the average value 4π/√3n. An initial guess for the geometry is obtained by centering the given 3D mesh geometry at the origin and projecting onto the sphere. To better condition the system, it is useful to anchor an arbitrary vertex to a fixed position on the sphere. This eliminates two degrees of freedom from SO(3), so is not damaging. It is not clear whether anchoring two arbitrary vertices limits the solution. It is clear that anchoring three vertices is damaging, since in the case of the equifaced tetrahedron, as described in Section 4.2, it is not always possible to generate a fourth vertex on the sphere which forms such a tetrahedron.</p><p>The initial guess also has an effect on which solution is obtained within the degrees of freedom. The different solutions to the same system (not related by a simple rotation) shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> were generated by using different initial guesses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Experimental Results</head><p>The theory presented in the previous sections may be used to generate a variety of embeddings of closed manifold genus-0 meshes on the unit sphere. The characteristics of the embedding may be controlled by the weights in the Laplacian matrix, similarly to the planar case. For example, uniform (Tutte) weights should be used if the spherical triangulation is required to be equi-angular, cotangential weights for a conformal angle-preserving mapping (although these can be negative), inverse edge lengths for a triangulation preserving edge lengths, and the prescription of Desbrun et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for an area-preserving triangulation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows some spherical embeddings generated by our procedure on three sample meshes, and compares them to those generated by the procedure of Alexa <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and those based on reduction to the planar case by stereo projection. The Tutte Laplacian produces an equi-angular triangulation, which is similar in some cases to that generated by Alexa's algorithm. Alexa's algorithm, though, sometimes tends to spread the vertices out over the sphere (as in the Triceratops model). The conformal embedding preserves many of the features of the 3D geometry, so the eyes and ears of the Rabbit are still noticeable in the result. The stereo embedding tends to lose most of the geometric structure.</p><p>In terms of runtimes, solving (2) using the MATLAB procedure required anywhere between a few seconds for the Pawn model of 154 vertices, and a few minutes for the Triceratops model (1,727 vertices) on a Xeon 2.8 GHz PC with 1GB RDRAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Parametrizing a closed manifold genus-0 mesh to the sphere is of paramount importance in digital geometry processing. It is a fundamental operation required for remeshing, morphing, filtering and texture mapping. While mapping between Riemann surfacees is well understood in the continuous case, the discrete case has not received satisfactory treatment to date. This paper has closed this gap, providing precise characterizations of discrete spherical parametrizations and efficient computation methods.</p><p>We have shown that there is a natural extension of the barycentric coordinate theory from planar triangulations to spherical triangulations, corresponding to the extension of the Laplacian operator to the Laplace-Beltrami operator in differential geometry. Unfortunately, the extension involves a transition from a linear theory to a non-linear theory, so is much more difficult to analyze and compute.</p><p>The extension of the theory of continuous Riemann surfaces to a combinatorial treatment of discrete triangle meshes has been made based on recent results in algebraic and spectral graph theory. This translates to a set of equations which may be solved with not too much difficulty.</p><p>The theory of Colin de Verdiere is based strongly on symmetric Laplacian-like matrices, while the classic barycentric coordinate theory does not require this. It would be interesting to determine whether this symmetry requirement is really necessary or can be eliminated.</p><p>A few questions remain open, most notably the analysis of the degrees of freedom in the various spherical embeddings, and how to control (or eliminate) them. Extensions to higher genus is also interesting.</p><p>Finally, we mention an intriguing connection between this work and the concept of "normal meshes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. These are multiresolution meshes whose vertices at one level can be expressed as a normal offset from a coarser level. This minimizes the parametric information in the mesh and provides a concise representation of the mesh geometry. This also means that the Laplace-Beltrami operator on these meshes also vanishes between resolution levels. Our spherical parametrizations may be seen to be singleresolution normal meshes. We wonder whether there is a deeper connection between the two. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Parametrizing the rabbit (see page 1) by (a) inverse stereo mapping (b) two hemispheres.
