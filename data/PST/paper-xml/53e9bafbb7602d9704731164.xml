<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Intervehicle communication (IVC) is emerging in research prominence for the interest that it is generating in all major car manufacturers and for the benefits that its inception will produce. The specific features of IVC will allow the deployment of a wide set of possible applications, which span from road safety to entertainment. Even if, on the one hand, these applications share the common need for fast multihop message propagation, on the other hand, they possess distinct characteristics in terms of generated network traffic. The state of the art of current research only proposes solutions specifically designed for a single application (or class) that is not directly extendable to a general IVC context. Instead, we claim that a privileged architecture exists, which is able to support the whole spectrum of application classes. To this aim, we propose a novel IVC architecture that adapts its functionalities to efficiently serve applications by quickly propagating their messages over a vehicular network. We conducted an extensive set of experiments that demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. As representative case studies, we considered two application classes that, for their network traffic characteristics, are at the opposite boundaries of the application spectrum: safety and entertainment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>road navigation support, location-related commercials, and networked interactive entertainment.</p><p>A feature typically shared by these services is that of having application messages transmitted through multihop ad hoc IVC among a group of vehicles (namely, a car platoon) covering an area of a few kilometers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. The problem in this context is that communications require very tight message delivery time to be effective, typically under the threshold of a few hundreds of milliseconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The scientific literature reports that the propagation speed of messages decreases with the increase of vehicles that attempt to forward them over the multihop path and, in general, with the network traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. Several approaches have been proposed, e.g., transmission rate adaptation, topology awarenessbased optimization, and intelligent election of message forwarders. Unfortunately, each of these schemes is affected by at least one of the following problems: redundant multihop transmissions, unrealistic assumptions about the vehicular environment, and generation of an elevate number of control messages. This causes an inefficient utilization of the (limited) available resources, thus negatively affecting the final performance of the system. Furthermore, this situation is exacerbated by the fact that different applications have peculiar characteristics, such as the generated network traffic, that existing solutions address in a specific way without a general vision. Instead, the efficiency of an IVC architecture should be independent from the application in use.</p><p>To this aim, we propose a novel IVC architecture intended to permit fast multihop broadcast of messages generated by a generic application. Our solution is able to adapt its functionalities to efficiently serve a wide variety of possible IVC applications, ranging from those generating very few and sporadic messages to those generating a continuous and intense transmission flow. In essence, our solution works in a distributed way among vehicles in a car platoon, and its main features are given in the list that follows.</p><p>1) An efficient priority scheme to choose the next-hop forwarder of a broadcast message based on the distance from the previous sender and on the expected transmission range: This way, redundant transmissions (and message propagation delays) are reduced. 2) A dynamic estimation of the transmission range that is used to correctly compute the aforementioned priority: This represents a fundamental feature in a highly dynamic scenario such as a vehicular network. 3) Only a minimal overhead caused by very few data that have to be exchanged among vehicles to appropriately feed the transmission range estimator: When possible, data for the transmission range estimator are directly embedded into regular application messages, without resorting to control messages (hello messages) at all. 4) A general solution framework enables quick propagation of messages whatever their generation rate and type, thus efficiently serving the whole spectrum of IVC applications. In conclusion, the main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a lightweight transmission range estimator that is able to provide a crucial information to select the best forwarder to increase the message delivery speed. Second, we have assembled our estimator with a vehicular network architecture to bring our novel technical solution into a practical context where different real applications may be run.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we specify the scenario that we are considering, whereas in Section III, we review related work. Our architectural solution is explained in Section IV. The experimental assessment and results are presented in Sections V and VI, respectively. Finally, Section VII concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CONSIDERED SCENARIO</head><p>We consider a group of cars that drive at various speeds on a multilane strip-shaped portion of a road, e.g., a highway. Surroundings are represented by buildings, hills, trees, and several other possible sources of interference. IVC is thus exposed to frequent and ample variations in terms of transmission range and available bandwidth.</p><p>Vehicles are assumed to be endowed with onboard systems for communication, self-localization, monitoring, and entertainment. This is a realistic assumption since we have the following.</p><p>1) The ongoing development of the DSRC/IEEE 802.11p technology promises to provide vehicles with communication capabilities [1].</p><p>2) The popularity of Global Positioning System-based devices is increasing as they are becoming increasingly less expensive. 3) Cars are increasingly endowed with all sort of sensors to detect failures in the car as well as dangers from outside the car (e.g., radar and cameras). 4) About 1 million of new cars and sport-utility vehicles are sold every year in the U.S. with preinstalled television/ digital video disc systems. This technology can be put to good use in a multitude of ways when placed on board, enabling a wide range of IVC applications and services.</p><p>In this paper, we analyze the performance improvement achieved by our architecture when supporting two of these application classes that, for their network traffic characteristics, are at the opposite boundaries of the IVC application spectrum: road vehicle safety and networked interactive entertainment. As can be seen in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, these two application classes share the same requirements for quick and reliable message delivery to all engaged vehicles; however, other features may greatly differ: Road vehicle safety applications tend to generate little bursts of traffic and for a limited time <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, whereas networked interactive entertainment generates a continuous flow of transmitted messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. An IVC architecture should be effective, regardless of the application in use.</p><p>We consider two practical case studies-one from each of these two application classes: accident alert communication and online gaming, respectively. We choose this two cases as they represent two IVC "killer" applications that will have great market penetration [1], <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Statement</head><p>One of the most prominent issues in vehicular networks regards the quick, epidemic, and scalable delivery of data among all participants that share the same application. As IVC is wireless and hence shared in nature, it would be highly inefficient to utilize a scheme that, for every game event, generated as many unicast multihop transmissions as the number of players. Rather, the fastest and less resource-consuming way to perform this operation is represented by multihop broadcast of messages over the car platoon.</p><p>However, if no intelligence is applied to the multihop broadcasting scheme, any node in the network would simply relay every received message. The consequent explosion in terms of transmitted messages would lead to high congestion, collisions, delays, and even to transmission paralysis of the vehicular network. In some sense, this phenomenon can be seen as a particular instance of what is generally known in the mobile ad hoc network's literature as the broadcast storm problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, typical IVC applications require the presence of a solution able to efficiently propagate messages over a car platoon. Such solution has to guarantee limited utilization of network resources and quick message delivery, regardless of the application in use.</p><p>As a final remark, we point out that, for many applications, message-delivery reliability can also be important. Unfortunately, the need for conciseness imposes us to limit the scope of this paper to a delimited problem and its solution. We have hence preferred to mostly focus on the speed of message propagation rather than on its reliability. However, some preliminary evaluation of the reliability issue has been reported in Sections VI-B and E. To further explore this issue, a number of feasible solutions could be integrated in the future with our system, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. INTERVEHICLE COMMUNICATION MULTIHOP BROADCAST: BACKGROUND</head><p>It is widely accepted in the literature that fast IVC multihop broadcast passes through having as few redundant transmissions as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. Indeed, a slow broadcast delivery can be due to a nonoptimal number of hops experienced by a message to cover the whole vehicular network and, more in general, by an excessive number of simultaneous forwarders. Now, we review prominent approaches proposed in the literature that address this issue.</p><p>Transmission Rate Adaptation: To reduce the delivery delay due to an excessive number of transmissions, several works (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>) propose a backoff mechanism that reduces the frequency of message transmissions or retransmissions when congestion is the cause for propagation delays. Moreover, message forwarding can completely be stopped by a car as soon a following vehicle also starts to forward the message <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. Unfortunately, all these schemes neglect to consider a crucial factor, i.e., the number of hops a broadcasted message traverses before reaching its area of interest.</p><p>Topology Awareness-Based Optimization: Minimizing the number of hops that a message has to traverse to reach its car platoon may be obtained through building a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) from a graph whose nodes represent vehicles in the platoon, and an edge connects one node to another if the second node is in the transmission range of the first node <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. However, the implementation of this algorithm for IVC leads to great practical difficulties as it would require complete and continuously updated knowledge of the network topology, which is obtainable with at least O(n log n) control messages, when considering n cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. Moreover, the high mobility of vehicular networks may render obsolete the MCDS even before its completion.</p><p>Intelligent Election of Message Forwarders: To minimize the number of hops that a message experiences during its propagation over the vehicular network, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> assign different contention windows (CWs) to each car receiving a message; their respective CWs are inversely proportional to the distance from the previous sender. Each of these cars randomly selects a waiting time within its CW before forwarding the message (if nobody else already did). However, these schemes are affected by the assumption that there is a unique, constant, and wellknown transmission range for all cars in every moment. This is obviously not realistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. INTERVEHICLE COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURE</head><p>From the analysis of related works, it is clear how an efficient multihop broadcasting mechanism passes through having the farthest vehicle in the sender's transmission range becoming the next forwarder. However, to implement this scheme, the following has to be true.</p><p>Assumption 1: Each receiving vehicle is aware of its relative position within the sender's transmission range.</p><p>Unfortunately, this assumption is not true at all with many current systems. To this aim, we designed an IVC architecture that satisfies this assumption and enables quick delivering of multihop broadcast messages among users in a car platoon that are sharing a given application (whatever the application and its traffic features are). We named this architecture privileged IVC architecture (PIVCA).</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the main novelty of the proposed architecture is the inclusion of an IVC Session Layer between the Application Layer and lower layers. This new layer is responsible for optimizing the broadcast of each application message over the car platoon and is composed of three main components, namely, the Hello Message Generator, the Time Handler, and the Parameters Handler, which, in turn, includes PIVCA's core, i.e., the Transmission Range Estimator.</p><p>In the following, first, we present the global functioning of the IVC Session Layer. Then, we explain the meaning and use of the parameters employed by our solution. Finally, we discuss the algorithm that determines the message forwarder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Global Functioning of the IVC Session Layer</head><p>Each message generated by the Application Layer of a node has to pass through the IVC Session Layer before being transmitted. Here, the Parameters Handler encapsulates the message in a new message that includes some parameters in its header. These are then extracted and utilized by the Parameters Handler of the receiving nodes to update their own parameters. Among these parameters, there is also an estimation of the transmission range as computed by the Transmission Range Estimator. The transmission range estimation is an original contribution of this paper and represents the most important parameter sent along with the application message. It allows receiving vehicles to learn how far from the sender a given message will still be intelligible and what their relative position is within this distance. This way, Assumption 1 is true, and vehicles can determine their own priority in becoming the next forwarder (i.e., the farthest vehicle in the sender's transmission range will be privileged in becoming the next forwarder).</p><p>To compute a correct transmission range estimation, the IVC Session Layer needs information, i.e., parameter values, from other vehicles with a certain regularity. This does not mean that messages (and updated parameters) have to be transmitted/ received very frequently, as in other schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. Rather, empirical evidence shows that even hearing just one message every 100 ms is enough for PIVCA to provide a useful estimation of the transmission range. However, certain applications such as, for instance, alert message propagation for traffic safety generate messages only once in a while (minutes). Therefore, to provide a readily available transmission range estimation even to these applications, if no message is exchanged in the network for a certain time, the Hello Message Generator takes care of generating a hello message just for the sake of broadcasting parameters.</p><p>Clearly, measuring how much time has elapsed since the last message transmitted or received requires a means to keep track of the time and trigger the generation of a hello message. This is the task of the Time Handler, which is also responsible for setting timers to implement the distributed mechanism for prioritizing vehicles that are farther away to become the next forwarder of a given application message: The farther the vehicle, the smaller the CW (and hence the time waiting before forwarding the message).</p><p>For the sake of clarity, the basic functioning of our architectural solution can be summarized in the list that follows.</p><p>1) To achieve fast multihop broadcast of an application message over a car platoon, PIVCA tries to reduce as much as possible the total amount of transmissions for its propagation; this is achieved by prioritizing the farthest vehicles in the message's transmission range to become the next forwarder. 2) To implement this priority system, every sender includes in the sent message its own current transmission range estimation. Receiving vehicles can thus be aware of their position within the sender's transmission range and compute a waiting time, which is inversely proportional to the distance from the sender. The vehicle with the smallest waiting time will be the next forwarder. 3) Each vehicle continuously computes and updates its transmission range estimation by exploiting data (e.g., position and hearing capability) coming from other vehicles in the vicinity. To limit the amount of network traffic, when possible, these data are included in regular application messages; otherwise, a few special control (hello) messages are specifically generated to transmit them. 4) Timers are utilized to determine whether enough time has passed, and it is hence opportune to transmit a hello message to feed the transmission range estimators of vehicles in the vicinity. They are also utilized to determine whether the waiting time has passed, which was associated with the priority of a vehicle that has become the next forwarder of an application message, and it is the time for the considered vehicle to take charge of forwarding it (if no one else was faster).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Employed Parameters</head><p>More in detail, in any application or hello message generated by a vehicle, the Parameters Handler inserts the following data:</p><p>1) sender's position, driving direction, and identifier;</p><p>2) message's direction of propagation and identifier;</p><p>3) sender's backward maximum distance (BMD) parameter;</p><p>4) sender's frontward maximum distance (FMD) parameter; 5) sender's backward maximum range (BMR) estimation; 6) sender's frontward maximum range (FMR) estimation. Parameters BMD and FMD represent the maximum distance from which another vehicle, backward or frontward, respectively, has been heard by the considered vehicle.</p><p>The Parameter Handlers of receiving vehicles exploit the received information about position, BMD, and FMD to compute their BMR and FMR values. BMR and FMR represent how far a transmission is expected to go before the signal becomes too weak to be intelligible. They are specifically discussed in the list that follows.</p><p>1) BMR is obtained by considering only messages coming from following vehicles; its value is computed as the maximum among the longest distance from vehicles that generated these messages and the highest among their FMD values included in these messages. 2) FMR utilizes only messages sent by preceding vehicles; its value corresponds to the maximum among the longest distance from which a message has been received from a preceding vehicle and the highest BMD advertised within these messages. Computing correct values of BMR and FMR and broadcasting them with any application message is one of the unique features of our solution and is of paramount importance as it allows other vehicles around to determine their relative position within the sender's transmission range.</p><p>Considering for simplicity only the case where cars are all driving in the same direction and application messages are only sent backward (the other case is specular), we have the following functions for parameters utilized by PIVCA.</p><p>Messages Received From the Front: These messages allow the receiver to compute FMD through</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">FMD = max(FMD current , d) (1)</formula><p>where FMD current is the current FMD value to be updated, and d is the distance from the vehicle that broadcast the message. The updated FMD value will then be declared by the receiver in its future messages, which claims the following: "This FMD is the farthest distance from which I have been able to hear another car in front of me." Messages Received From the Back: Because they include the sender's FMD and position, messages received from the back provide the receiver with information about the hearing capabilities of following cars. This is exactly what the receiver needs to know to heuristically compute its BMR through</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">BMR = max(BMR current , d, msg.FMD) (2)</formula><p>where BMR current is the current value to be updated, d is the distance of the vehicle that broadcast the message, and msg.FMD is the FMD value contained in the received message, which is related to the maximum hearing distance. The updated BMR value will then be sent along with future messages as it was saying the following: "This BMR value is the maximum backward distance at which some car is able to hear me." Since cars are moving, all stored parameters are periodically refreshed. Finally, the current formulation of our algorithm assumes the transmit power and the channel propagation laws to be symmetric; otherwise, estimation errors may happen <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Forwarder Selection Algorithm</head><p>The rationale of our solution is to prioritize vehicles that are farther away when forwarding received messages. Vehicles' priorities to forward a message are determined by assigning different waiting times from the reception of the message to the time at which they will try to forward it. This waiting time is computed based on a CW, as inspired by classical backoff mechanisms in IEEE 802.11 medium-access control (MAC) protocols.</p><p>At each hop, the self-elected forwarder updates BMR and FMR fields of the message with its computed values to make available proper parameters for the next portion of the road.</p><p>The CW utilized by each vehicle is measured in slots and varies between a minimum (CWMin) and a maximum (CWMax), depending on the distance from the sending/ forwarding vehicle (Dist) and on the advertised estimated transmission range. The transmission range corresponds to BMR if the message is directed backward or to FMR if the message is directed frontward. The two cases, which are indicated by CW B and CW F , are shown in the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">CW B = BMR -Dist BMR (CWMax -CWMin) + CWMin (3) CW F = FMR -Dist FMR (CWMax -CWMin) + CWMin . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>Upon receiving the message from the front, the considered car extracts BMR and utilizes (3) to determine its CW B and then computes a random waiting time based on it. If, while waiting, the same message is heard again, coming from behind, then the message has already propagated over the considered car that can therefore, stop trying to forward it. Conversely, if the same message is heard from frontward, then a preceding car has already forwarded it; the application message-forwarding procedure has hence to be restarted with the new parameters included in the message by the last forwarder.</p><p>If the waiting time expires without having heard any other car forwarding the same message, then the considered car includes in the message its own current parameters, including BMR, and broadcasts it (obviously, the same, even if specular, procedure applies to the FMR parameter).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT</head><p>We carried out an extensive study to test our solution and compare it with other schemes inspired by the scientific literature. The tool utilized for our experiments is NS-2 (version ns-2.29) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>; we modified MAC layer's parameters to make it similar to IEEE 802.11p and added software to compare PIVCA with other solutions. The configuration is summarized in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, and our software is available online <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</p><p>More in detail, the number of slots for CWMin and CWMax was inspired by the standard IEEE 802.11 protocol. The idle time threshold after which a hello message is generated by the Hello Message Generator is set equal to 100 ms. This means that about ten hello messages with a payload of 50 bytes are generated every second, within a transmission range area, (only) if no application transmission happens.</p><p>We have compared our PIVCA with three other possible solutions. Two of them are inspired by the solution presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. This scheme is similar to PIVCA in that it attempts to have the farthest node in the transmission range as the next-hop forwarder. However, it differs from PIVCA because it simply assumes to have the transmission range parameter constantly equal to a known predetermined value, rather than being able to dynamically compute it according to the factual channel condition. Compared with our PIVCA shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it hence lacks the Parameter Handler (with the Transmission Range Estimator). We name this architectural solution Fixed300 if it utilizes 300 m as the transmission range parameter and Fixed1000 if it employs 1000 m.</p><p>Needless to say, Fixed300 and Fixed1000 ideally perform when the factual transmission ranges are 300 and 1000 m, respectively. In any other situation, the utilization of a wrong parameter can result in performance degradation. The choice of focusing on 300 and 1000 m of range comes directly from the IEEE 802.11p draft, which indicates these two values as the boundaries for a highway scenario <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>We also evaluated Random, which is a solution that does not employ any distance prioritization, to represent an architecture employing a classic multihop broadcasting scheme. Simply stated, every car computes a random waiting time within the CW before forwarding the message. The adapted CW is initially set to CWMin and follows a general backoff mechanism by which its value doubles every time a transmission attempt results in a collision and linearly decreases with every successful transmission.</p><p>With the accident alert communication application, we let the simulation run for 2 min, after which, the first vehicle in the car platoon generated an alert message. Instead, with the online game application, the number of players periodically generating game events varied from 2 to 50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. PRIVILEGED INTERVEHICLE COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURE'S PERFORMANCE</head><p>To compare the various schemes, we analyze their ability in quickly delivering messages to all interested vehicles: accident alert messages in Section VI-A (with crash performance evaluation in Section VI-B) and online game events in Section VI-C. The same experiments are also used in Section VI-D to check how our system scales with increased transmission ranges. We dedicate Section VI-E to investigating reliability and Section VI-F to analyzing the influence of the time slot duration on PIVCA's performance. To measure the performance, we consider only messages belonging to the worst case, i.e., those sent by the car leading the car platoon to cover the whole vehicular network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Accident Alert Communication: Delivery Time With a Short Transmission Range</head><p>We start our evaluation by focusing on the accident alert communication application. As mentioned, this application generates a message only in the case of the abnormal behavior of some vehicle. Hence, its low message-transmission rate makes it necessary to transmit (few) hello messages to get information about vehicles' transmission ranges. Obviously, the overhead due to hello messages employed by our architecture is very limited, i.e., less than 1 kb/s within a transmission range area.</p><p>The next charts present outcomes related to the transmission of an alert message that has to be propagated from a certain vehicle to all following vehicles in a 4-km range. We consider 4 km as the point at which there is no point in transmitting an instantaneous alarm farther: Even a car driving at 120 km/h would need 2 min to reach the 4-km-away critical area. However, nothing impedes to set a larger (or smaller) area of interest if it is deemed more appropriate. The number of vehicles per kilometer of a (multilane) road varies from 50 to 250, representing different density levels; the factual range is 300 m.</p><p>The number of hops that an alert message requires to be propagated over the area of interest is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. PIVCA requires as few hops as is done by the scenario's ideal scheme (i.e., Fixed300); instead, Fixed1000 and Random require many more hops as the forwarders' prioritization mechanism of the former fails due to a wrong transmission range value, and the latter does not use prioritization at all. Another interesting outcome of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is represented by the fact that the number of hops for each scheme does not vary when augmenting the car density. This happens due to the fact that the election of the next forwarder for the compared schemes is either based on vehicles' positions within the sender's transmission range or if they are randomly chosen, which are both two properties that do not depend on vehicle density.</p><p>However, with a higher number of vehicles, it is more likely that two or more vehicles simultaneously try to forward the alert message, thus resulting in collisions, retransmissions, and a waste of time. In point of this fact, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the total delay required to propagate an alert message over the whole car platoon: All compared schemes are negatively affected by very high vehicle densities; however, the ideal scheme (Fixed300) and our PIVCA outperform the other two.</p><p>Moreover, even if Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows that PIVCA and Fixed300 have similar outcomes, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> reports that the former is always slightly better when considering the final transmission time. In fact, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> includes also other factors, such as the number of time slots within the employed CW that the forwarder will wait for before transmitting the message. Indeed, even if we have set the transmission range to be 300 m, however, the wireless model realistically generates interference as would happen in real life; hence, the factual transmission range oscillates around 300 m. Conversely, from Fixed300, PIVCA dynamically adapts to the changing transmission range, employing (slightly) more appropriate CWs that reduce the final transmission time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Accident Alert Communication: Crash Performance</head><p>For the sake of completeness, we have performed a crashperformance evaluation similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. We have mathematically modeled a car platoon of 30 cars traveling at 32 m/s (115 km/h), with an intervehicular distance of 28.8 m (the distance traveled in 0.9 s with a 32-m/s speed). At a certain point, the vehicle in front of the platoon has an accident, and its speed is quickly reduced with a deceleration of 8 m/s 2 . By braking, following cars decelerate at 4 m/s 2 . If a car hits another one, then both their speeds decelerate at 8 m/s 2 until they stop. The drivers' reaction time is uniformly distributed between 0.75 and 1.5 s. Drivers are assumed to be able to see two cars in front of them; they are also assumed to brake, after the reaction time, if their car receives an alert message or if one of the two vehicles in front of them brakes. The position of each car is    checked every 0.125 ms, and an accident is assumed to happen if the distance between two vehicles becomes smaller than 4 m (the car's length).</p><p>Four scenarios are compared: 1) No alert messages are implemented, only reaction times; 2) alert messages are implemented through our system, and all vehicles are able to receive them; 3) alert messages are implemented and delivered through our system, but due to bad connectivity or low market penetration of the technology, only one vehicle out of three (randomly chosen and uniformly distributed over the car platoon) is able to receive the message; and 4) alert messages are implemented through our system, but their delivery delay is 2.5 times that suggested by NS-2. The performances achieved in the four scenarios are reported in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, respectively. The charts show the relative speed between two consecutive cars when they stop or hit each other: An accident has occurred when the value is higher than zero, and higher values correspond to the worst accidents.</p><p>As is evident, our system effectively reduces the number of vehicles involved in a chain accident. The charts also show a tradeoff between the vehicular network coverage achieved by the alert communication and its effectiveness; for instance,  even if vehicle 5 brakes in time, it is still involved in the accident as vehicle 6 (that did not receive any alert message) crashes into it. Solutions able to ensure a wider coverage (e.g., transmission power management <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>) may be explored in combination with our system. Still, even with just one vehicle out of three receiving the alert message, the performance is significantly better than with no alert message at all. This is not surprising: Even a few randomly distributed cars receiving the alert message and braking in advance help following cars in anticipating their braking time (they brake as the vehicle in front of them is braking).</p><p>Finally, since simulations are generally an imperfect model of the real world <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, we have also tested our solution in the crash performance test considering the pessimistic case, where the factual transmission time for an alert message was 2.5 times what NS-2 simulations suggested. Results are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>; the comparison with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows that, in this case, there is one more car involved in the accident, even if at a low speed, and that vehicle 3 hits the preceding car at a slightly higher speed. This demonstrates that, even under these conditions, our solution would save lives compared with the case of no accident alert communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Online Games: Delivery Time With a Short Transmission Range</head><p>We now consider the online gaming application and compare PIVCA, Fixed300, Fixed1000, and Random on an 8-km-long vehicular network, 200 μs of slot duration, 50 players, and 300 m of transmission range. We have analyzed performances considering different generation rates for game events with each player. Specifically, game events were generated at each vehicle every 100, 300, or 500 ms.  Outcomes are presented in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The first property that emerges is that PIVCA always obtains better results than the other three schemes, even better than Fixed300 (which is supposed to be the ideal scheme in this scenario). This result is due to the ability of PIVCA to adapt to the slight variations of the transmission range generated by the wireless model, as discussed for Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The second evident property is that all four schemes seem almost independent of the employed messagesending rate. This indicates that the experiment configuration did not saturate the network; we can only observe a slight degradation of the performance with the highest messagesending rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Delivery Time With a Long Transmission Range</head><p>To complete our evaluation of PIVCA's performance, we have considered a scenario with 1000 m of transmission range. Compared with the 300-m case, we expect to witness a higher transmission interference as a single transmission range area hosts more communicating vehicles. This is particularly true for the online game application because of its high messagegeneration rate and multitude of sources. Therefore, we present here outcomes only for this application, which is more stressful for the system than accident alert communication.</p><p>The number of hops required to cover the car platoon in this scenario is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>; Fixed1000 outperforms Fixed300. Without any predetermined knowledge, PIVCA succeeds in properly estimating the transmission range for each vehicle and performs as Fixed1000 does.</p><p>Analyzing the final transmission time required to propagate a message over the whole car platoon, we notice that, if the game application generates a message on each vehicle every 100 ms, the total transmission time is considerably higher than the other two considered cases (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>). This is due to an excessive increment of the traffic on the wireless channel: Many players are in range of each other when considering a transmission range of 1000 m. This causes collisions and timeconsuming retransmissions, as also confirmed by results shown in the next section. However, even in this case, PIVCA and the ideal scheme (here, Fixed1000) outperform the other two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Delivery Reliability</head><p>While it is not our aim to propose solutions for reliability, we completed our study with an evaluation of PIVCA's ability to deliver messages to all vehicles engaged in the same application. We present outcomes for the game application as its intense network traffic represents a tougher challenge for reliable transmissions than propagating a single alert message.</p><p>The outcomes for the case with 300 and 1000 m of factual transmission ranges are reported in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively. All the various schemes present similar performances. In particular, high reliability is guaranteed until each player generates a game event every 100 ms. In this case, the percentage of messages received by all vehicles drops to about 90% with a transmission range of 300 m and to less than 65% with a transmission range of 1000 m.</p><p>The second case is clearly more critical, because in a 1000-m transmission range area, there are roughly three times the number of players (and transmitted messages) present than in a 300-m transmission range area. The combination of a long transmission range with an intense message-generation rate causes collisions, retransmissions, delays, and even a lack of delivery reliability. In the case of intense congestion, there  is not much that can be done but to reduce the group of simultaneous players. Instead, with mild congestion, significant improvements can also be achieved by resorting to aggregation of messages or to exploiting game semantics to determine which game events supersede others and transmit only the former ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Influence of the Time Slot Duration on PIVCA</head><p>Finally, we investigate the performance variation of PIVCA when employing different time slot sizes for the CW. We considered a scenario with 300 m of factual transmission range and 50 players. The outcomes shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref> represent the instantaneous variation of the delivery time of each single game event to the farthest player in the car platoon. Clearly, an increase of the total delivery time corresponds to a longer time slot duration. When considering fast-paced games (or accident alert communications), only small delivery delays are acceptable. Therefore, time slots larger than 200 μs would not be a feasible configuration.</p><p>However, too small time slot values could result in elevate collisions, interference, and lack of reliability in delivering each message. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref> shows the percentage of game events that were successfully delivered to all players. When employing time slots of 9 μs, the increased delivery speed shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref> is paid with a noticeable reduction of reliability (see values for one message generated every 100 ms).</p><p>In summary, 200 μs is the only value among the tested ones that provided both fast and reliable message delivery.</p><p>We evaluate, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>, the speed of PIVCA's Transmission Range Estimator in dynamically computing the transmission range of each vehicle with at most 5% of overestimation or underestimation of its real value.</p><p>As expected, with higher message-generation rates, PIVCA needs less time to compute the correct estimation. This is a logic consequence of the fact that the estimation is based on data about vehicles' positions and "hearing" distances that are exchanged through application/hello messages. Therefore, the more messages there are, the more information is received, and the correct estimation can be built quicker. However, all the evaluated configurations show a few delays: 20 ms at most; this proves that our architectural solution is able to extremely rapidly adapt, which is a crucial feature in a highly dynamic scenario such as a vehicular network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>IVC is the forthcoming frontier in mobile communication. A particularly interesting case study has been represented by distributed interactive applications run by vehicles spread in a few kilometers of range. This class of applications has been featured with the requirement of fast message delivery, through multihop broadcast, over the vehicular network. Nonetheless, other features such as the message-generation rate may sensibly vary when considering different specific applications.</p><p>To support a broad range of IVC applications, we have designed a software architecture, named PIVCA, that permits fast multihop propagation of messages to all engaged vehicles. This result is achieved via smart solutions aimed at reducing the number of transmissions required to propagate the message. Our architecture is able to adapt its functionalities to the network traffic generated by different applications. The advantages in employing PIVCA have been demonstrated through an extensive set of experiments.</p><p>This work can be extended in several directions. First, we have finalized a personal digital assistant-based prototype of our solution to perform a real test-bed evaluation. Moreover, we are enhancing our algorithm to be proficient even in a grid-based scenario (i.e., the streets of a town). We also plan to combine PIVCA with some of the solutions mentioned in Section II-A, which aim to increase the reliability of IVC. To ensure compatibility, PIVCA has been designed to operate at high network layers; however, studies show that there is an optimal choice of transmission range for the latency when considering 802.11-based MAC protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. It would be interesting to combine the two approaches to improve performance even further. Finally, it would be interesting to perform a precise evaluation of the sensitivity analysis of the estimation error on the final performance of the system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
