<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Non-rigid structure from motion (NRSFM) is a difficult, underconstrained problem in computer vision. The stan dard approach in NRSFM constrains 3D shape deformation using a linear combination of K basis shapes; the solution is then obtained as the low-rank factorization of an input observation matrix. An important but overlooked problem with this approach is that non-linear deformations are often observed; these deformations lead to a weakened low-rank constraint due to the need to use additional basis shapes to linearly model points that move along curves.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate how the kernel trick can be ap plied in standard NRSFM. As a result, we model com plex, deformable 3D shapes as the outputs of a non-linear mapping whose inputs are points within a low-dimensional shape space. This approach is flexible and can use diff erent kernels to build diff erent non-linear models. Using the ker nel trick, our model complements the low-rank constraint by capturing non-linear relationships in the shape coeffi cients of the linear model.

The recovered 3D shapes provide necessary information to applications in object recognition, face perception, biometrics, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction, among many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">II,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. In many of these scenar ios, the 3D object of interest undergoes a series of shape deformations while being observed under a varying pose. The recovery task is then known as the problem of non rigid structure from motion (N RSFM). Given a set of cor responding 2D points in a sequence of images depicting a deformable object, the goal in NRSFM is to recover the 3D object shape and pose (i.e., relative camera position) in each image. In the absence of any prior knowledge on 3D shape shape space 3D shape t =1 G � �\ .</p><p>' r:</p><p>• , "' ...... deformation, such as object rigidity, computing NRSFM is still a difficult, underconstrained problem.</p><p>The large majority of works in NRSFM are variants of the standard matrix factorization approach first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This approach constraints all 3D shapes to lie within the linear space spanned by a small number K of unknown 3D basis shapes. Recent research work has attempted to define additional, general constraints to make this NRSFM formulation more tractable <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>.</p><p>However, work on NRSFM rarely analyzes some of the implications of modeling shape deformation as linear com binations of basis shapes. As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, the deformation of some shapes is better represented by moving points along curves. This is the case, for example, of shapes with many uncorrelated articulations, relative rotation, and bending ef fects. Linear models can only approximate these shape de formations at the cost of requiring multiple basis elements that increase the number of unknowns that need to be esti mated. As a result, the 3D reconstruction task becomes less and less constrained and prone to error (e.g., a residual error on the small shape deformation that is difficult to eliminate). This argument also applies to the case where a deformable 3D shape is seen as a single point moving within a space containing the true, low-dimensional shape manifold.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a Kernel NRSFM approach to model and recover non-linear 3D shape deformation from 2D image streams (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We first demonstrate how the "kernel trick," commonly used for non-linear dimensional ity reduction in pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, can be applied to the standard matrix factorization approach in NRSFM. As a result, we model 3D shapes as the outputs of a non-linear mapping whose inputs are points within a low-dimensional shape space. Our model complements the low-rank con straint by capturing non-linear relationships in the shape coefficients of the linear model. The dimensionality h of the new shape space is usually very small (h = 2 in our ex periments) and h is also independent of the number of basis shapes K used by the kernalized NRSFM algorithm.</p><p>In addition, assuming shape deformation is gradual, we solve for the smooth time-trajectory of a single point within the h-dimensional shape space. This trajectory is compactly represented using only the low-frequency coefficients of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. Using this rep resentation, we introduce a novel formulation of the shape basis constraints of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> and enforce the basis shapes to lie somewhere along the smooth shape trajectory, without the need to correspond to one of the observed shapes. As a re sult, each basis shape is modeled by a single unknown, a time-parameter, regardless of the dimensionality h. There fore, the total number of unknowns in our model is reduced considerably, while providing flexibility of representation.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the NRSFM methods that are more closely related to our approach and presents the basic formulation we will need to derive our algorithm. Section 3 introduces the kernel trick into the NRSFM matrix factorization approach, discussing the implications and also problems that are addressed by our new algorithm derived in Section 4. Experimental results are presented in Section 5 and the conclusion in Section 6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Smooth Shape Trajectories in a Linear Space</head><p>To further constrain the estimation of the model above, many authors assume that the observed 3D shape deforma tion is only gradual over time t = 1, ... , T <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">II,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</p><p>For instance, the shape trajectory approach (STA) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> considers c; = c ( t) as a single K -dimensional point de scribing a smooth time-trajectory within an unknown linear shape space. This means that each shape coordinate Ct, k varies smoothly with t. The shape trajectory is then mod eled compactly using a small number d of low-frequency DCT coefficients, ... , <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref> Here, X E IR d x K represents C compactly in the domain of the truncated DCT basis matrix O d E IRTx d . The rh column of O d is the j t h-frequency cosine wave with entries W t ! = Jr c o s Cr ( 2t -��(f -1 )) ,t = 1 ,2, ... , T, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref> where CT 1 = 1 and, for j ::,. 2, CT ! = V2. Because the DCT bases are known a priori, the number of unknowns in C is significantly reduced with STA.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, the STA model was shown to subsume the fac torization of the point trajectory approach (PTA) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which models independent 3D point trajectories instead of 3D shapes. The two models are equivalent when X above is equal to Xo = [I K ° V, the K x K identity stacked over a block of zeros. Thus, for a factorization of rank-3K, the solutions of PTA correspond to smoothed versions of those of STA. In contrast to PTA, STA can model higher frequency DCT coefficients in X without relaxing the low rank constraint. However, the Euclidean update step of PTA is easier to compute because the only unknowns in factor M are those of the camera matrix D <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For this reason, STA starts with X = Xo and computes D as done by PTA.</p><p>The final optimization stage of STA considers that S = MtW is a function of M and W, with t denoting the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. The goal is then to min imize the reprojection error j (M) = IIW -W* II}, W* = MS = MMtW, (7)   where II•IIF is the Frobenius norm. Given D computed as above, M is treated as a function of X only. The higher frequency DCT coefficients in X are then estimated using an iterative Gauss-Newton algorithm to minimize (7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Locally Linear and Articulated Models</head><p>The NRSFM algorithm in [II] relaxes the linearity as sumption for the shape manifold by using linear models to represent only small neighborhoods of shapes. Conse quently, a number of locally linear models need to be esti mated and the total number of parameters is larger than that of the standard NRSFM method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Initialization of these parameters requires an elaborate clustering of images with similar shapes, which can also be a performance issue for the case of long image sequences.</p><p>Other specialized, articulated shape models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref> com prise a number of linear subspaces and depend on a prior, non-trivial process of segmentation of point tracks and clas sification of their motion subspaces. Although these meth ods convey additional information (e.g., positions and ori entations of joints), experimental results show that misclas sification usually happens near joints and axes.</p><p>In the next sections, we propose a compact and general model for shapes with linear and non-linear deformations. Our kernel NRSFM algorithm does not require prior cluster ing of points or images. In contrast to [II], our method can smoothly interpolate between images and reconstruct par tially occluded 3D shapes. The flexibility of our approach is also reflected by the fact that different non-linear models can be built according to the kernel function used.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The Kernel Trick</head><p>Considering S = MtW, NRSFM by matrix factoriza tion reduces to estimating M as to provide a rank-3K ap proximation W* ;::: :: : W given by W* = MMtW as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>. We note that Mt = (M T M) -1 M T can alternatively be expressed as Mt = M T (MM T )t. The proof is easily ob tained from the SVD form of M. The new rank-3K approx imation for W is then modeled as To apply the kernel trick to (9), we replace Ko in M by a kernel matrix K E IRTxT whose ( t, n t h entry is ,, ( er , en , instead of the standard inner product er e t '. The function" ( . , . ) can be regarded as a generalized inner prod uct and is known as a Mercer kernel [12]. Here, ,,(-, . ) mea sures the similarity between two shape vectors, er and ef, .</p><p>For clarity, in the following we will consider only the popular radial basis function (RBF) kernel, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> where I is a scale parameter. However, note that our ap proach can be easily modified to use a dilferent kernel. If the linear kernel is used, for instance, one goes back to lin ear NRSFM with Ko as in (9).</p><p>The kernel in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> can be seen as a non-linear map ping of each low-dimensional shape representation c[ into an infinite-dimensional space of radial basis functions, � (c[, . ), where a linear representation is more suitable. The "trick" is that we do not need to explicitly represent the shapes in this infinite-dimensional space because the algo rithm depends only on the generalized inner products <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>. Thus, the kernel trick gives a combination of two mappings:</p><p>(i) a non-linear mapping represented by the kernel function, capturing the non-linearity of the problem; and (ii) a linear mapping represented by the matrix products in (9).</p><p>In NRSFM by matrix factorization, the problem with re placing Ko in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is that we cannot guarantee that the new kernel matrix K will be of low-rank K (with K Q9 1 3 of rank 3K). Thus, this version of kernel NRSFM becomes largely underconstrained. Next, we address this problem by reintro ducing the low-rank constraint into the derivations above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The Low-Rank Constraint in Kernel NRSFM</head><p>To derive a low-rank formulation of kernel NRSFM, we consider a sparse approximation for the kernel matrix K that has been used to speed up kernel methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.

The problem with these basis constraints is that, from all possible combi nations of K out of T shapes, we do not know the active set that best represents all shapes. To avoid a complex search algorithm for the optimal active set, we elaborate this ap proach further in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Kernel STA</head><p>This section presents our new NRSFM algorithm, re ferred to as the Kernel Shape Trajectory Approach (KSTA). KSTA uses the non-linear mapping of kernel NRSFM to further constrain the STA model (Section 2.2) and reduce the number of dimensions of the shape space. First, we avoid the combinatorial problem of Section 3.2 by removing the basis constraints. Inspired by the STA model, we derive novel basis constraints that generalize the idea in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">New Basis Constraints on the Shape Trajectory</head><p>Removing the shape basis constraints simply implies that, while we factorize W with M as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>, we need to estimate the basis shapes bf, vk, together with the shape vectors c[. Importantly, a basis shape no longer needs to be equal to a shape observed in one of the T images. We now have as additional unknowns the K basis shapes, bf, </p><p>as points in an h-dimensional shape space. Because h de termines the number of unknowns we need to estimate (as discussed below), h should be small as to yield a compact model. In our experiments, complex non-linear deforma tions were modeled with a very small h = 2.</p><p>Assuming that shape deformation is smooth from one image to the next, we adapt the STA model in (5) and con sider cf = c ( t) to describe a smooth time-trajectory within the h-dimensional shape space. Thus, where w f is the t t h row of the DCT matrix f!d and X is a compact representation of the shape trajectory.</p><p>To model h[, we introduce new basis constraints that represent a compromise between the traditional basis con straints and the unconstrained case. We will therefore only require that the h[ be similar (not necessarily equal) to some cf . This new constraint is enforced by modeling h[ somewhere along the continuous shape trajectory c(t). That is, we model the time-samples</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">h[ = b(tk) = w(tkfX, tk E [ 1, T], 't:!k, (IS)</formula><p>where w(tkf is a row vector of d low-frequency cosine terms (6) at time tk. Hence, each basis shape introduces only a single, continuous new variable, tb regardless of the dimensionality h of the shape space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Model Analysis</head><p>Indeed, linear models can represent a set of 3D shapes showing non-linearly deformations -as the number of ba sis shapes K approaches the number of observed shapes T, perfect representation is possible. Our claim is that, in linear NRSFM, non-linear deformations reduce the etlectiveness of the low-rank constraint due to the need to use additional basis shapes, increasing K.</p><p>Using the kernel trick, our model complements the low rank constraint by capturing the non-linear relationships in the shape coefficients of the linear modeli.e., the new Kc•b approximates the original C in (2). The net effect can be seen as using non-linear dimensionality reduction to further compress the (shape) space of possible solutions.</p><p>Let's consider the compactness of the KSTA model above in comparison to linear NRSFM. The original method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> defines C using T K parameters, while STA requires dK (with d « T for smooth deformations). Through non linear dimensionality reduction and new basis constraints, KSTA can further compress the model of Kc•b to dh+ K + 1 unknowns, with h :s; K :s; d. This number includes the pa rameter, used by the RBF kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>.</p><p>We note that our model bears some similarity with the non-linear dimensionality reduction approach of [S], where the dimensionality of the latent space (h) and the size of the active set (K) are treated as user supplied parameters. On the other hand, our method is not probabilistic and we fur ther compress the representation in the h-dimensional space using the DCT-based trajectory model (17).</p><p>Another observation is that the user-supplied parameters d and h are often easy to set (typically, d E {0.IT,O.3T} and h E {2, 3}). Results vary considerably more according to the choice of K, as observed with other NRSFM meth ods. Cross-validation methods and additional priors have been used to automatically estimate K and to regularize the reconstruction process when K is over-estimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>; these techniques will be used with our model in future ex periments. Here, for clarity, we focus on the new ideas in troduced by KSTA and assume K is known from prior ex perience with a particular application scenario.</p></div>

Note that all these four methods make use of linear models.</p><p>Our experiments considered the same datasets that where chosen by the authors of the methods above. The number of frames (T) and the number of point tracks (n) are indicated as (Tin) after a dataset's name. We considered the mo tion capture sequences: drink (1102/41), pick-up (357141), yoga (307/41), stretch (370/41), and dance (264/75) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; face] (74/37) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>; face2 (316/40), walking (260/55), and the synthetic shark sequence (240/91) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. We also introduce another full-body motion capture dataset, capoeira (250141), with more complex deformations -the typical sideways swing of this African-Brazilian mixture of dance and martial art (see supplementary video available at http://www.ece.osu.edulrvgotardop).</p><p>We followed the same evaluation procedure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. For each dataset, W is obtained by applying an orthographic projection on the sequence of 3D shapes. Be cause the solution of NRSFM methods is defined up to an arbitrary 3 x 3 rotation, we compute a single rotation that best aligns all reconstructed and original 3D shapes. Let et j be the reconstruction error (i.e., Euclidean distance) for the lh 3D point of frame t. We then compute a normalized mean 3D error over all points and frames,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">I T n e3D = -'"' '"' et .• aTnLL J.</formula><p>t =l j=l (21) with atx, at y , and atz the standard deviations of the X-, y-, and z-coordinates of the original shape in frame t.</p><p>For each algorithm, we report the best result of different runs with K E {2, 3, ... ,13}. For all datasets, the recon structions computed with KSTA were modeled within a 2dimensional shape space (h = 2). KSTA had the number of DCT bases set to d = O.IT (i.e., 10%), except for facel, face2, walking, and capoeira, on which we set d = 0.3T due to the presence of higher frequency deformations. Ta ble 1 compares the performances of the NRSFM methods above in terms of the obtained error e3D. The value of K for the best solutions of PTA, STA, and KSTA are also shown for comparison of these DCT-based methods.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows that the results of KSTA are consistently better than or similar to the best results provided by the other methods on each dataset. Also, note that KSTA mod els all these deformable shapes using a highly compact 2dimensional shape space (h = 2). Therefore, in comparison to the other linear algorithms, KSTA can better constrain the reconstruction problem while the number of basis shapes K increases (because h is independent of K).</p><p>As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6]</ref>, further decrease in the error e3D for stretch, pick-up, and yoga is prevented by the larger er rors in estimating the artificial rotations added to these se quences. Future extensions to our algorithm include the use of a simple technique that refine the estimated rotations and 3D shapes in alternation, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</p><p>An important observation is that, in comparison to STA, the non-linear mapping of KSTA makes it more sensitive to the initialization of X. By varying the value of K in the initial STA step (but still using the first h-columns of X as computed with STA), we have run KSTA with different ini tializations and have obtained e3D error values as low as 0.0858 for the walking dataset. Future experiments will in vestigate alternative initialization procedures to consistently improve performance on all the datasets above.</p><p>Note that the walking dataset has recently been consid ered <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> as beyond the scope of NRSFM methods without an specialized, articulated model. With KSTA, the recon struction error on this sequence has becomes of the same order of magnitude as that of the deformable facial shapes. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2(a)</ref> shows examples of 3D reconstructions for this se quence in comparison to the original 3D data (we show re sults for the same frames appearing in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>). The smooth and approximately periodic shape trajectory estimated by KSTA is plotted on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2(b)</ref>.</p><p>The flexible, kernel-based model of KSTA represents a promising contribution towards the development of new NRSFM algorithms that can reconstruct 3D shapes with more complex deformations. This argument is also sup ported by the large performance improvement obtained on the capoeira dataset. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3(a)</ref> shows example reconstruc tions obtained with KSTA on this sequence. The sharp changes in the shape trajectory of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3(b</ref>) captures the time instant when the sideways motion is reversed. In this sequence, sudden changes in the motion of hands and feet correspond to high-frequency deformation and introduce lo calized reconstruction errors; see result for frame 120 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3(a)</ref>. In general, deformation smoothness is also more weakly defined at the beginning and end of a sequence. Fu ture work will address detection and correction of these is sues, affecting the results of NRSFM algorithms that ex-  plore the assumption of smoothness of deformation.</p><p>To assess the performance of KSTA in NRSFM with oc clusion, we reproduce the experiment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10]</ref> and apply the algorithms above to the face2 dataset with p% of its 2D entries randomly discarded. KSTA was run to minimize the objective (20) with the same parameters described above for the complete dataset. Note that PTA does not handle occlu sion and, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, the performance EM-PPC A was shown to be inferior to that of MP. Results of MP, STA, and KSTA, averaged over 100 trials, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>. While the average e3D of MP increases with p above 30%, the perfor mance of STA and KSTA show little variation over all the tested levels of random occlusion.</p><p>The runtimes of KSTA on the complete datasets above were usually very short, around 5 minutes on a laptop PC with a 3 GHz dual-core processor. KSTA was implemented in Mathwork's Matlab™and the source code is available at http://www. ece. osu. edu! � gotardo pI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper addressed the problem of modeling complex non-linear shape deformations that weaken a main pillar of   NRSFM, the low-rank constraint. Using the kernel trick, we proposed a new approach that generalizes the standard matrix factorization in NRSFM. The derived kernel-based model complements the low-rank constraint by capturing the non-linear structure in the shape coefficients of the Iin-ear model. Experimental results show that some complex articulated deformations can be modeled with a reconstruc tion error of the same order of magnitude as that of simpler cases with facial shape deformations. These results are ob tained without the use of specialized articulation models.</p><p>Our kernel-based model is flexible and represents a promising contribution towards the development of new NRSFM algorithms that can reconstruct 3D shapes with more complex deformations. Although the results reported here have only considered the RBF kernel, the use of our approach with other kernels is straightforward and will be investigated in the future. Despite our aim at a general method, future investigation is needed to define kernels that better suit the modeling of specific deformable 3D objects from 2D image streams.</p></div>
