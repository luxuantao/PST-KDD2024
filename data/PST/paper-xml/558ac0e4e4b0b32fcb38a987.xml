<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We address the problem of output regulation for nonlinear systems driven by a linear, neutrally stable exosystem whose frequencies are not known a priori. We present a classical solution in terms of the parallel connection of a robust stabilizer and an internal model, where the latter is adaptively tuned to the device that reproduces the steady-state control necessary to maintain the output-zeroing condition. We obtain robust regulation (i.e., in presence of parameter uncertainties) with a semiglobal domain of convergence for a significant class of nonlinear minimum-phase system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>in some way this information also, which is usually done by means of feedback schemes based on the so called "internalmodel principle." It is in fact well known, since a long time in the case of linear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and since about ten years or so in the case of nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, that-if the trajectories/disturbances in question are not known but it is known that they belong to a specified class of functions of time (such as in the classical problem of set point control)-asymptotic tracking can be successfully achieved if the feedback mechanism incorporates a device that is able to "generate" all such trajectories/disturbances. A remarkable feature of the internal-model based control schemes for linear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is that they guarantee asymptotic decay of the tracking error also in the presence of plant parameter uncertainties (so long as the stability of the overall feedback loop is preserved), a property of paramount importance that has been recently extended also to internal-model based schemes for nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In linear systems, the role of the internal model is that of securing that the corresponding closed-loop system has a transfer function, between the exogenous input (the uncertain trajectory/disturbance to be followed/rejected) and the tracking error, with a set of transmission zeros that includes all the eigenvalues of the autonomous dynamical system which is supposed to generate all such trajectories/disturbances (the exosystem). The simple consequence of this is that all such exogenous inputs are asymptotically blocked in their transit through the system and this remarkable feature remains in effect despite the plant parameters uncertainties.</p><p>Internal model-based control schemes efficiently address the problem of tracking/rejecting families of exogenous inputs, all those that can be thought as generated by a fixed autonomous finite-dimensional dynamical system (the initial condition of which identifies the actual, unknown, exogenous input affecting the plant). In this sense, they generalize the classical way in which integral-control based schemes cope with constant but unknown disturbances. However, the main limitation of these schemes is that a precise model of the system that generates all exogenous inputs must be available, to be replicated in the control law. This limitation is not sensed in a problem of set point control, where the uncertain exogenous input is constant and thus obeys a trivial, parameter independent, differential equation but becomes immediately evident in the problem of rejecting e.g., a sinusoidal disturbance of unknown amplitude and phase. An internal model-based controller is able to cope with uncertainties on amplitude and phase of the exogenous sinusoid, but the frequency at which the internal-model oscillates must exactly match the frequency of the exogenous sinusoid: any mismatch in such frequencies results in a nonzero steady-state error.</p><p>Motivated by the wish to remove such a limitation, we address in this paper the problem of designing an internal-model based control scheme in which the "natural frequencies" of the internal model are automatically tuned so as to match those of an exosystem which is totally unknown (except for an upper bound on its dimension). In this context, we provide a control scheme that is able to successfully address the problem of asymptotically tracking/rejecting any family of exogenous inputs generated by some (fixed dimensional, but otherwise completely unknown) autonomous dynamical system, for a significant class of nonlinear systems, in the presence of possibly large parameter uncertainties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>The systems we consider in this paper are single-input, singleoutput finite-dimensional nonlinear systems, described by equations of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with state , control input , and output . The system depends on a vector of unknown parameters , whose values are assumed to range over a known compact set . Without loss of generality, contains the origin in its interior. The vector field and the output map are assumed to be smooth, with and for every value of . The system is driven by an exogenous input generated by a neutrally stable linear time-invariant exosystem of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> The exosystem depends on a vector of unknown parameters, assumed to range over a known compact set . We denote with the regulated error, being a smooth function of its arguments.</p><p>The control input to (1) is to be provided by an error-feedback controller modeled by equations of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> with state , in which and are smooth, with , . The problem we consider in this paper is the following: given arbitrary fixed compact sets , , find a controller of the form (3) and a compact set , such that 1) the equilibrium of the unforced closed loop system ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is asymptotically stable for every , with domain of attraction containing the set ; 2) the trajectory of the closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> originating from any initial conditions exists for all , is bounded and satisfies for every and every . We stress the fact that, contrary to the classic formulation of the regulator problem, both in the nonlinear <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the linear setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the controller has to be designed on the basis of an uncertain exosystem. A trivial necessary condition for the existence of a solution to the above problem is the solvability for every value of . This, in turn, implies the existence of a local, structurally stable solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, that is, the existence of a dynamic feedback controller which solves the problem in a neighborhood of , and a neighborhood of , for every fixed . Byrnes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have shown that this can be accomplished only if, given a fixed , there exist mappings and , with and , both defined for , satisfying</p><p>for all , and such that the autonomous system with output <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> is immersed into a system defined on a neighborhood of the origin, possessing a detectable linear approximation. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">6</ref>) establishes the existence of a controlled-invariant submanifold of the state space on which the error is identically zero, and whose friend (in the terminology of Wonham <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) is given by the output of the autonomous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The solution of the problem of structurally stable regulation is then obtained as the parallel connection of two separate controllers of the form ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> The first controller, commonly referred to as the internal model, has the role of generating asymptotically the input , while the second one locally exponentially stabilizes the interconnection of the plant and the first controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The extension of this methodology to our specific problem faces two obstacles: first, and more fundamental, the internal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> can not be directly implemented, as it depends on the vector of uncertain parameters . Second, even in the case in which is known exactly, the presence of the internal model amounts to adding a neutrally stable zero dynamics to the plant model, which renders the stabilization via output feedback of the interconnected structure a very difficult task. Usually, in order to simplify the design of an output-feedback stabilizer, one has to make restrictive hypothesis on the class of systems under consideration, such as feedback linearizability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> or input-to-state stability of the inverse dynamics of the plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In this paper, motivated by the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we employ a particular parameterization of the internal model, which we regard as a "canonical" one. This allows the stabilization problem to be solved in an almost straightforward way if the exosystem is exactly known, under the standard assumption that the zero dynamics of the plant are asymptotically and locally exponentially stable. Most importantly, this parameterization can be viewed as a "certainty equivalence" internal model control, which can be extended to an adaptive scheme to solve the problem in presence of uncertainties in the exosystem. The adaptive controller indeed corresponds to a parameterized family of immersion mappings, which is exponentially convergent to the mapping that generates the unique input that renders the output-zeroing manifold invariant. As an added bonus, one can asymptotically estimate any finite number of distinct frequencies of the harmonics generated by the nonlinear system (not just by the linear exosystem), provided that this number is known.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section III, we state the assumptions necessary to the well-posedness of the problem, and we introduce some notation. The canonical parameterization of the internal model is presented in Section IV. Section V deals with the design of a partial-state feedback regulator in the case of perfect knowledge of the parameter . The adaptive internal model is presented in Section VI, where we address also the issues of convergence of the estimates and minimal parameterization of the adaptive controller. Finally, in Section VII we derive the error-feedback adaptive regulator, and we present a case study in Section VIII.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. THE CANONICAL INTERNAL MODEL</head><p>In this section, we describe a particular parameterization of the internal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, which will prove to be crucial to the solution of the problem. A major source of inspiration in deriving our result comes from Nikiforov's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and precisely from the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma IV.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>: Given any Hurwitz matrix and any vector such that the pair is controllable, the Sylvester equation has a unique solution , which is nonsingular.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. REGULATION VIA PARTIAL-STATE FEEDBACK</head><p>In this section, we design a controller that solves the problem of output regulation, starting from the simplifying assumption that the error and its derivatives are available for feedback, and the parameters of the exosystem are all known. These assumptions will be removed in the next sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Error System</head><p>We begin performing the global change of coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> which puts <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> in the so-called error system form <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where we have denoted . To simplify the notation, let . It is easy to see that, under the application of the input , system ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) has a globally defined invariant manifold in which the error is identically zero. We make the following assumption regarding the zero dynamics of system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, that is, the system Assumption V.1: There exists a smooth, positive-definite function such that for all , all and all , where , and are class-functions satisfying for some positive numbers , , , . Assumption V.1 restricts the class of ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) to those which are globally (and locally exponentially) minimum phase. Although this may seem restrictive, it is less stringent than the assumption of input-to-state stability of the inverse dynamics, typical of the previous literature on semiglobal output regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Also, we do not assume bounded input-bounded state stability of the inverse dynamics, as in recent works on adaptive and robust control <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Consider the following change of coordinates: <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where is a number yet to be determined, and the polynomial is Hurwitz. The change of coordinates (20) puts system (19) into the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> where being . Let us turn our attention to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> It is well known that, if assumption V.1 is satisfied, the equilibrium of system ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) is uniformly semiglobally asymptotically stable in the parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and locally exponentially stable. In particular, it is well known that, for each positive number there exist real numbers , , and, for any , a continuously differentiable, positive-definite function such that V.a) the set is compact, and contains in its interior; V.b) the estimate holds for any , for some positive numbers , , ;</p><p>V.c) , for any , for any , and for any , where is a positive-definite function satisfying for some positive number . Note that the explicit expression for is available. As a matter of fact, let , and define Denote with the companion matrix associated with the polynomial , and with the positive definite solution of the Lyapunov equation Then, the desired expression for is given by (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Internal Model Augmentation</head><p>The standard controller which solves the problem of output regulation consists of the parallel connection of a stabilizer and an internal model. In view of the discussion in Section IV, we augment the error system with an internal model of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> where is a vector to be determined, and set , with the stabilizing control selected as the high-gain feedback</p><p>In order to find an appropriate expression for , consider the resulting closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> where is solution of (2) with initial conditions , and change coordinates as</p><p>The new coordinate considers the mismatch between the state of the internal model and the immersion mapping, that is, the state of the "true" internal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. The term is added for the purpose of simplifying the resulting equations, as it will become clear in a moment. The first equation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> becomes, after some algebra and thus, in order to render this independent of , we choose obtaining <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> The second equation of ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) is left unchanged, while the third becomes</p><p>The transformed closed-loop system reads as <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> This can be viewed as the interconnection of system <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> with input and output , and the memoryless output feedback</p><p>. System <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> has a zero dynamics given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> The properties of system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, discussed in Section V-A, are crucial for the solvability of the problem. For the system (28), the following result holds. Proposition V.1: Fix , and determine and such that V.a)-V.c) hold. Then, there exists a continuously differentiable function such that • is proper on ; • the estimate holds for any , for some positive numbers , , ;</p><p>• the estimate holds for any , for any and , for some positive-definite function satisfying for some positive number . Proof: As the matrix is Hurwitz, the -subsystem in ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) is input-to-state stable with respect to the input , for any initial condition of the exosystem and any .</p><p>Therefore, as the trajectory is bounded and converges to as for any , the trajectory converges to for all initial conditions , for any and any</p><p>(see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). Thus, by lemma III.1, the system (28) is uniformly asymptotically stable, with domain of attraction which includes the positively invariant set . Note that is diffeomorphic to , as it is diffeomorphic to an open ball around the origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. One such diffeomorphism is given by the flow of the autonomous system for a fixed</p><p>. By corollary III.1, there exists a smooth Lyapunov function for the system (28), and is proper in . Next, we show that the origin of ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) is locally exponentially stable. First, note that assumption V.1 implies that there exists a symmetric positive definite matrix such that</p><p>Then, the quadratic function , where satisfies, for some and some for all . Then, consider the function where is a positive constant to be chosen, and is the positive-definite solution of the Lyapunov equation</p><p>The time derivative of along trajectories of (28) reads as, for all where is some positive number. Therefore, we can choose large enough so that for some positive constant , for all . Following a similar reasoning as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma 10.1.5]</ref>, it is now easy to show that there exists a function with the required properties, obtained through a suitable convex combination of and . Going back to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, we realize that the properties of the Lyapunov function guarantee that the high gain feedback uniformly asymptotically and locally exponentially stabilizes the equilibrium , with domain of attraction which can be enlarged to include any compact set of initial conditions. To see that this is indeed the case, fix compact sets of initial conditions , and for , and , respectively, and determine such that properties V.a)-V.c) hold for , with chosen such that . Then, for the positive-definite, locally quadratic function a number can always be found in such a way that the level set is compact and contains in its interior. By the semiglobal backstepping lemma of Teel and Praly [22, Lemma 2.2], there exists a value such that, if , the derivative of along trajectories of ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) satisfies where and is chosen small enough so that This shows that every trajectory originating within the level set is captured by the set . It can be easily shown that there exists a value such that, if , the estimate holds for some , as long as . Therefore, there exists a positive-definite function , locally quadratic around the origin, such that, if is chosen greater than , the derivative of along trajectories of ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) satisfies for all . The result of this section is summarized in the following. Theorem V.1: Suppose the parameter of the exosystem (2) is known. Denote with , , the th derivative of the error . There exist numbers and such that, if and , the dynamic controller solves the problem of semiglobal robust output regulation for the class of systems under consideration. Remark: As in any controller solving a problem of semiglobal stabilization via "high-gain" state feedback, and also clear from the previous discussion, the values of the parameters and depend of the compact sets on which the initial conditions of plant and exosystem are allowed to range, and on the compact sets to which the uncertain parameters and are supposed to belong. Indeed, and increase as the "sizes" of these sets increase. In general, in this as well as in similar semiglobal stabilization problems, it is not convenient or it may even be impossible to give closed formulas relating and to the sets , . In our case, for instance, depends on the function whose existence derives from an inverse stability theorem, but whose expression is not readily available. Nevertheless, the result of the previous Theorem shows that the closed-loop system possesses infinite margins with respect to the gain parameters and . Thus, one is guaranteed that increasing the values of these parameters will eventually yield the desired asymptotic properties for all initial conditions in , and all in .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. TUNING THE INTERNAL MODEL</head><p>The controller designed in the previous section is based on the standard assumption that the parameters of the exosystem are exactly known. This corresponds, in the classical setup of the output regulation problem, to consider as exogenous inputs constant and sinusoidal signals of known frequency and unknown amplitude and phase. If the vector is not known, we need to employ a method to asymptotically estimates the frequencies of the exogenous signal as well. We show how an "adaptive" version of the above controller can be effectively implemented. The adaptation algorithm "tunes" a parameterized family of internal models to the one which reproduces the signals generated by the exosystem and the nonlinearities of the plant. We first derive our controller under the assumption that none of the eigenvalues of the exosystem (and, consequently, of the internal model) are known in advance, and then we show how to modify the scheme when some eigenvalues are in a fixed known location on the imaginary axis.</p></div>

Now, consider the linear system <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> System <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> is ubiquitous in the model-reference adaptive control literature: it can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 13]</ref>, that this latter is uniformly observable if the signal satisfies the persistence of excitation (PE) condition, that is, there exist positive constants , such that Recall that and note that, by assumption, the -dim signal contains sinusoids of distinct frequencies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Case II: Partially Known Exosystem</head><p>In several cases it is legitimate to assume that some eigenvalues of the true internal model are known in advance. This includes the familiar cases in which one has to track or reject constant signals, and thus the internal model has to provide an integral action, or when is needed to track a known sinusoidal signal. In order to avoid overparameterization of the adaptive controller, we devise a method to incorporate the a priori knowledge of the eigenvalues of the internal model into the control scheme. Suppose to split the spectrum of the internal model into known and unknown eigenvalues, and determine the corresponding modal subspaces and . Consider the following expression for the internal model: <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> where is the restriction of to , and the pair is in observable companion form. The matrix is yet to be chosen, and the matrix denotes the restriction of to , written in the canonical parameterization.

Thus, the interconnected system is asymptotically stable, and this shows that is Hurwitz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. ERROR-FEEDBACK ADAPTIVE CONTROLLER</head><p>The dynamic controller (31) makes use of the derivatives of the error up to th order, that is, it processes information from the partial state of the error system. In order to realize a device that uses information from the error signal only, the partial state must be replaced by suitable estimates. The saturated high-speed observer of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>) can be effectively used to generate estimates of the error and its derivatives. The observer in question is a linear system of the form (37)</p><p>where the matrices and have the form is a design parameter, and the polynomial is Hurwitz. In order to prevent the occurrence of finite escape times for large values of the parameter , the estimates need to be saturated outside a compact set. The controller is then implemented using the estimates in place of the measurements of the partial state. If appropriate local conditions hold, and if the saturation level is chosen appropriately, the performance of the original partial-state feedback controller in terms of asymptotic stability of the origin and size of the domain of attraction are asymptotically recovered as <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In our case, we need to replace by a suitable asymptotic estimate. Consider the new dynamic output feedback controller <ref type="bibr">(38)</ref> where is a saturation function, defined as if if .</p><p>For the controller just introduced, the following result applies. Theorem VII.1: Consider the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> driven by the exosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The dynamic controller (38) solves the problem of robust semiglobal regulation via feedback from the error <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>Proof: The proof follows directly from the application of the tools for semiglobal stabilization in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 12]</ref>). For the sake of simplicity, let , and denote with the fixed compact set of initial conditions . In order to apply the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we are left to show that, for the closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, there exists a Lyapunov function satisfying the following properties: VII.a) there exists a level set which is compact, and contains the set in its interior; VII.b) the derivative of along trajectories of (30) satisfies for all , for all initial conditions of the exosystem , and for all ; VII.c) there exist positive numbers , , , such that and</p><p>As shown in Section VI, the equilibrium is uniformly asymptotically stable, with domain of attraction which includes the invariant set which is diffeomorphic to</p><p>. By Corollary III.1, there exists a Lyapunov function which satisfies VII.a), VII.b), and is proper in . Also, we have shown that the closed loop system (30) is locally exponentially stable, with domain of exponential stability which contains an open neighborhood of the origin, which is independent of and . Thus, there exists a quadratic Lyapunov function satisfying VII.c). Once again, the required Lyapunov function is given by an appropriate convex combination of and . It is worth noting that the error-feedback adaptive controller does not require smooth projection of the parameter estimates, as instead is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. However, in a practical implementation, the use of an high-speed observer makes necessary to use a smooth projection method to enhance robustness of the adaptive system in face of unmodeled dynamics or noise, whose effects are amplified by the high gain of the observer. The presence of a projection, while not changing the results of the paper, adds a substantial complexity in the derivation of the equations, and therefore it has been omitted. The interested reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. EXAMPLE</head><p>As an illustrative example, consider the controlled Van der Pol equation in which the term is regarded as a perturbation. The parameter vector is assumed to satisfy while the exosystem is the harmonic oscillator  in which ranges between 1 and 4 rad/s. Note that, for , the plant has a stable limit cycle, whose orbit and period depend on the value of . The initial conditions for the exosystem have been assumed to lie in the set . The compact set of initial conditions for the state of the plant has been chosen as the closed cube . Easy computations show that the regulator equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">6</ref>) have the following globally defined solution:</p><p>The autonomous system ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is immersed into the four-dimensional system <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, with given by</p><p>The canonical parameterization of the internal model has been chosen such that the matrix has the following characteristic polynomial:</p><p>with roots . The nominal internal model has been designed for the case rad/s. To improve the numerical stability of the adaptive algorithm, the triplet has been obtained through a balanced realization from the controllability canonical form. The balanced realization yields equal and diagonal controllability and observability Gramians of the system (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> for details). As opposite to other canonical forms, the balanced realization is numerically well-conditioned. Compare, for instance the values of in Tables <ref type="table">I</ref> and<ref type="table">II</ref>. The first table corresponds to a canonical companion form, while the second to a balanced realization. It is easy to see that in the first case the variation of the first component of is of order , while the variation of the same parameter for the balanced realization is of order . The controller parameters have been chosen according to Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. Note that, since the plant has relative degree 2, the gain can be chosen to be any positive number. A lower bound on the gain can not be computed a priori, since the expression of the Lyapunov function is not available. However, the result in Section V-B ensures that system has  an infinite gain margin with respect to , and thus it suffices to pick sufficiently large to achieve stabilization of the closed loop system. Similar considerations apply to the choice of the gain and the saturation level of the observer. In all the reported simulations, the initial conditions for the exosystem have been chosen as , and the parameter vector as . In the first simulation, the frequency of the exosystem is chosen as rad/s, while the internal model has been tuned for rad/s. The adaptation is disconnected at first, and then it has been turned on at s. We notice a remarkable steady-state error (about 10%) until the adaptation is connected (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the evolution of the parameter estimates . At s, the adaptation has been disconnected. Remarkably, no error arises, which shows that the adaptive internal model has been tuned to the "right one." At this regard, Table <ref type="table">IV</ref> shows the eigenvalue of the adaptive internal model at the time the parameters have been frozen. At time s, we change the frequency of the exosystem to rad/s. This time, we do observe a steady-state error, as the frequencies of the internal model do not match those of the exosystem and the third harmonic generated by the plant. At time s, we turn the adaptation on again, and we recover zero steady state error, as the internal model is tuned again to the right frequencies (see Table <ref type="table">V</ref>). In the second simulation, we perform the same experiment, but we do not turn the adaptation off. From Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, we observe that the change of frequency at s is rapidly compensated for by the adaptive scheme. Moreover, to test the robustness of the control law to structural changes in the plant dynamics, we set the parameter to zero at s. This does not affect the stability of the closed loop system, which recovers the steady state after a brief transient. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, finally, compares the output of the internal model and the "true" steady-state input .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have shown how one of the greatest limitations of output regulation theory so far, namely the requirement of complete knowledge of the frequencies of the exosystem, can be overcome by incorporating an adaptation mechanism in the internal model-based control. Inspired by the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we have solved the problem of semiglobal robust regulation with unknown frequencies of the exosystem for a large class of nonlinear systems, in the very general framework of the nonlinear regulator theory of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. A case study has been presented to show the effectiveness of the method, which may prove to be of great importance in control applications.</p></div>
