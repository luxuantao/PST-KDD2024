<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Visual recognition tasks involving language, such as captioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Vinyals et al., 2015)</ref>, visual question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Antol et al., 2015)</ref>, and visual semantic role labeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yatskar et al., 2016)</ref>, have emerged as avenues for expanding the diversity of information that can be recovered from images. These tasks aim at extracting rich seman-tics from images and require large quantities of labeled data, predominantly retrieved from the web. Methods often combine structured prediction and deep learning to model correlations between labels and images to make judgments that otherwise would have weak visual support. For example, in the first image of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it is possible to predict a spatula by considering that it is a common tool used for the activity cooking. Yet such methods run the risk of discovering and exploiting societal biases present in the underlying web corpora. Without properly quantifying and reducing the reliance on such correlations, broad adoption of these models can have the inadvertent effect of magnifying stereotypes.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a general framework for quantifying bias and study two concrete tasks, visual semantic role labeling (vSRL) and multilabel object classification (MLC). In vSRL, we use the imSitu formalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yatskar et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Yatskar et al., , 2017))</ref>, where the goal is to predict activities, objects and the roles those objects play within an activity. For MLC, we use MS- <ref type="bibr">COCO (Lin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al., 2015)</ref>, a recognition task covering 80 object classes. We use gender bias as a running example and show that both supporting datasets for these tasks are biased with respect to a gender binary<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p><p>Our analysis reveals that over 45% and 37% of verbs and objects, respectively, exhibit bias toward a gender greater than 2:1. For example, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the cooking activity in imSitu is a heavily biased verb. Furthermore, we show that after training state-of-the-art structured predictors, models amplify the existing bias, by 5.0% for vSRL, and 3.6% in MLC. Each image is paired with a table describing a situation: the verb, cooking, its semantic roles, i.e agent, and noun values filling that role, i.e. woman. In the imSitu training set, 33% of cooking images have man in the agent role while the rest have woman. After training a Conditional Random Field (CRF), bias is amplified: man fills 16% of agent roles in cooking images. To reduce this bias amplification our calibration method adjusts weights of CRF potentials associated with biased predictions. After applying our methods, man appears in the agent role of 20% of cooking images, reducing the bias amplification by 25%, while keeping the CRF vSRL performance unchanged.</p><p>To mitigate the role of bias amplification when training models on biased corpora, we propose a novel constrained inference framework, called RBA, for Reducing Bias Amplification in predictions. Our method introduces corpus-level constraints so that gender indicators co-occur no more often together with elements of the prediction task than in the original training distribution. For example, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we would like noun man to occur in the agent role of the cooking as often as it occurs in the imSitu training set when evaluating on a development set. We combine our calibration constraint with the original structured predictor and use Lagrangian relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Korte and Vygen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rush and Collins, 2012)</ref> to reweigh bias creating factors in the original model.</p><p>We evaluate our calibration method on imSitu vSRL and COCO MLC and find that in both instances, our models substantially reduce bias amplification. For vSRL, we reduce the average magnitude of bias amplification by 40.5%. For MLC, we are able to reduce the average magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5%. Overall, our calibration methods do not affect the performance of the underlying visual system, while substantially reducing the reliance of the system on socially biased correlations 2 .</p><p>2 Code and data are available at https://github. com/uclanlp/reducingbias</p></div>

It is known that big-data technologies sometimes inadvertently worsen discrimination due to implicit biases in data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Podesta et al., 2014)</ref>. Such issues have been demonstrated in various learning systems, including online advertisement systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Sweeney, 2013)</ref>, word embedding models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bolukbasi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Caliskan et al., 2017)</ref>, online news <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ross and Carter, 2011)</ref>, web search <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kay et al., 2015)</ref>, and credit score <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hardt et al., 2016)</ref>. Data collection biases have been discussed in the context of creating image corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Misra et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">van Miltenburg, 2016</ref>) and text corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gordon and Van Durme, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Van Durme, 2010)</ref>. In contrast, we show that given a gender biased corpus, structured models such as conditional random fields, amplify the bias.</p><p>The effect of the data imbalance can be easily detected and fixed when the prediction task is simple. For example, when classifying binary data with unbalanced labels (i.e., samples in the majority class dominate the dataset), a classifier trained exclusively to optimize accuracy learns to always predict the majority label, as the cost of making mistakes on samples in the minority class can be neglected. Various approaches have been proposed to make a "fair" binary classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barocas and Selbst, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dwork et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Feldman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zliobaite, 2015)</ref>. For structured prediction tasks the effect is harder to quantify and we are the first to propose methods to reduce bias amplification in this context.</p><p>Lagrangian relaxation and dual decomposition techniques have been widely used in NLP tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Sontag et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rush and Collins, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chang and Collins, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Peng et al., 2015)</ref>) for dealing with instance-level constraints.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Visualizing and Quantifying Biases</head><p>Modern statistical learning approaches capture correlations among output variables in order to make coherent predictions. However, for realworld applications, some implicit correlations are not appropriate, especially if they are amplified. In this section, we present a general framework to analyze inherent biases learned and amplified by a prediction model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identifying bias</head><p>We consider that prediction problems involve several inter-dependent output variables y 1 , y 2 , ...y K , which can be represented as a structure y = {y 1 , y 2 , ...y K } ∈ Y . This is a common setting in NLP applications, including tagging, and parsing. For example, in the vSRL task, the output can be represented as a structured table as shown in Fig 1 <ref type="figure">.</ref> Modern techniques often model the correlation between the sub-components in y and make a joint prediction over them using a structured prediction model. More details will be provided in Section 4.</p><p>We assume there is a subset of output variables g ⊆ y, g ∈ G that reflects demographic attributes such as gender or race (e.g. g ∈ G = {man, woman} is the agent), and there is another subset of the output o ⊆ y, o ∈ O that are corelated with g (e.g., o is the activity present in an image, such as cooking). The goal is to identify the correlations that are potentially amplified by a learned model.</p><p>To achieve this, we define the bias score of a given output, o, with respect to a demographic variable, g, as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">b(o, g) = c(o, g) g ∈G c(o, g )</formula><p>, where c(o, g) is the number of occurrences of o and g in a corpus. For example, to analyze how genders of agents and activities are co-related in vSRL, we define the gender bias toward man for each verb b(verb, man) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c(verb, man) c(verb, man) + c(verb, woman)</formula><p>.</p><p>(1)</p><p>If b(o, g) &gt; 1/ G , then o is positively correlated with g and may exhibit bias.</p><p>Evaluating bias amplification To evaluate the degree of bias amplification, we propose to compare bias scores on the training set, b * (o, g), with bias scores on an unlabeled evaluation set of images b(o, g) that has been annotated by a predictor. We assume that the evaluation set is identically distributed to the training set. Therefore, if o is positively correlated with</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g (i.e, b * (o, g) &gt; 1/ G ) and b(o, g) is larger than b * (o, g),</formula><p>we say bias has been amplified. For example, if b * (cooking, woman) = .66, and b(cooking, woman) = .84, then the bias of woman toward cooking has been amplified. Finally, we define the mean bias amplification as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 |O| g o∈{o∈O|b * (o,g)&gt;1/ G } b(o, g) − b * (o, g).</formula><p>This score estimates the average magnitude of bias amplification for pairs of o and g which exhibited bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Calibration Algorithm</head><p>In this section, we introduce Reducing Bias Amplification, RBA, a debiasing technique for calibrating the predictions from a structured prediction model. The intuition behind the algorithm is to inject constraints to ensure the model predictions follow the distribution observed from the training data. For example, the constraints added to the vSRL system ensure the gender ratio of each verb in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) are within a given margin based on the statistics of the training data. These constraints are applied at the corpus level, because computing gender ratio requires the predictions of all test instances. As a result, a joint inference over test instances is required<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> . Solving such a giant inference problem with constraints is hard. Therefore, we present an approximate inference algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation. The advantages of this approach are:</p><p>• Our algorithm is iterative, and at each iteration, the joint inference problem is decomposed to a per-instance basis. This can be solved by the original inference algorithm. That is, our approach works as a metaalgorithm and developers do not need to implement a new inference algorithm.</p><p>• The approach is general and can be applied in any structured model.</p><p>• Lagrangian relaxation guarantees the solution is optimal if the algorithm converges and all constraints are satisfied.</p><p>In practice, it is hard to obtain a solution where all corpus-level constrains are satisfied. However, we show that the performance of the proposed approach is empirically strong. We use imSitu for vSRL as a running example to explain our algorithm.</p><p>Structured Output Prediction As we mentioned in Sec. 3, we assume the structured output y ∈ Y consists of several sub-components. Given a test instance i as an input, the inference problem is to find arg max</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y∈Y f θ (y, i),</formula><p>where f θ (y, i) is a scoring function based on a model θ learned from the training data. The structured output y and the scoring function f θ (y, i) can be decomposed into small components based on an independence assumption. For example, in the vSRL task, the output y consists of two types of binary output variables {y v } and {y v,r }. The variable y v = 1 if and only if the activity v is chosen. Similarly, y v,r = 1 if and only if both the activity v and the semantic role r are assigned<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> . The scoring function f θ (y, i) is decomposed accordingly such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f θ (y, i) = v y v s θ (v, i) + v,r y v,r s θ (v, r, i),</formula><p>represents the overall score of an assignment, and s θ (v, i) and s θ (v, r, i) are the potentials of the subassignments. The output space Y contains all feasible assignments of y v and y v,r , which can be represented as instance-wise constraints. For example, the constraint, v y v = 1 ensures only one activity is assigned to one image.</p><p>Corpus-level Constraints Our goal is to inject constraints to ensure the output labels follow a desired distribution. For example, we can set a constraint to ensure the gender ratio for each activity in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is within a given margin. Let y i = {y i v } ∪ {y i v,r } be the output assignment for test instance i<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> . For each activity v * , the constraints can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">b * −γ ≤ i y i v=v * ,r∈M i y i v=v * ,r∈W + i y i v=v * ,r∈M ≤ b * + γ</formula><p>(2) where b * ≡ b * (v * , man) is the desired gender ratio of an activity v * , γ is a user-specified margin. M and W are a set of semantic role-values representing the agent as a man or a woman, respectively.</p><p>Note that the constraints in (2) involve all the test instances. Therefore, it requires a joint inference over the entire test corpus. In general, these corpus-level constraints can be represented in a form of A i y i − b ≤ 0, where each row in the matrix A ∈ R l×K is the coefficients of one constraint, and b ∈ R l . The constrained inference problem can then be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">max {y i }∈{Y i } i f θ (y i , i), s.t. A i y i − b ≤ 0,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where {Y i } represents a space spanned by possible combinations of labels for all instances. Without the corpus-level constraints, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">3</ref>) can be optimized by maximizing each instance i max</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">y i ∈Y i f θ (y i , i),</formula><p>separately.</p><p>Lagrangian Relaxation Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">3</ref>) can be solved by several combinatorial optimization methods. For example, one can represent the problem as an</p><p>Dataset Task Images O-Type O imSitu vSRL 60,000 verb 212 MS-COCO MLC 25,000 object 66 Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Statistics for the two recognition problems. In vSRL, we consider gender bias relating to verbs, while in MLC we consider the gender bias related to objects. integer linear program and solve it using an offthe-shelf solver (e.g., Gurobi (Gurobi Optimization, 2016)). However, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">3</ref>) involves all test instances. Solving a constrained optimization problem on such a scale is difficult. Therefore, we consider relaxing the constraints and solve Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">3</ref>) using a Lagrangian relaxation technique (Rush and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Collins, 2012)</ref>. We introduce a Lagrangian multiplier λ j ≥ 0 for each corpus-level constraint. The Lagrangian is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L(λ, {y i }) = i f θ (y i ) − l j=1 λ j A j i y i − b j ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where all the λ j ≥ 0, ∀j ∈ {1, . . . , l}.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Setup</head><p>In this section, we provide details about the two visual recognition tasks we evaluated for bias: visual semantic role labeling (vSRL), and multi-label classification (MLC). We focus on gender, defining G = {man, woman} and focus on the agent role in vSRL, and any occurrence in text associated with the images in MLC. Problem statistics are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. We also provide setup details for our calibration method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Visual Semantic Role Labeling</head><p>Dataset We evaluate on imSitu <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yatskar et al., 2016)</ref> where activity classes are drawn from verbs and roles in FrameNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker et al., 1998)</ref> and noun categories are drawn from WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Miller et al., 1990)</ref>. The original dataset includes about 125,000 images with 75,702 for training, 25,200 for developing, and 25,200 for test. However, the dataset covers many non-human oriented activities (e.g., rearing, retrieving, and wagging), so we filter out these verbs, resulting in 212 verbs, leaving roughly 60,000 of the original 125,000 images in the dataset.</p><p>Model We build on the baseline CRF released with the data, which has been shown effective compared to a non-structured prediction baseline <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yatskar et al., 2016)</ref>. The model decomposes the probability of a realized situation, y, the combination of activity, v, and realized frame, a set of semantic (role,noun) pairs (e, n e ), given an image i as :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">p(y|i; θ) ∝ ψ(v, i; θ) (e,ne)∈R f ψ(v, e</formula><p>, n e , i; θ)</p><p>where each potential value in the CRF for subpart x, is computed using features f i from the VGG convolutional neural network (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) on an input image, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ψ(x, i; θ) = e w T x f i +bx ,</formula><p>where w and b are the parameters of an affine transformation layer. The model explicitly captures the correlation between activities and nouns in semantic roles, allowing it to learn common priors. We use a model pretrained on the original task with 504 verbs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Multilabel Classification</head><p>Dataset We use MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014), a common object detection benchmark, for multilabel object classification. The dataset contains 80 object types but does not make gender distinctions between man and woman. We use the five associated image captions available for each image in this dataset to annotate the gender of people in the images. If any of the captions mention the word man or woman we mark it, removing any images that mention both genders. Finally, we filter any object category not strongly associated with humans by removing objects that do not occur with man or woman at least 100 times in the training set, leaving a total of 66 objects.</p><p>Model For this multi-label setting, we adapt a similar model as the structured CRF we use for vSRL. We decompose the joint probability of the output y, consisting of all object categories, c, and gender of the person, g, given an image i as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">p(y|i; θ) ∝ ψ(g, i; θ) c∈y ψ(g, c, i; θ)</formula><p>where each potential value for x, is computed using features, f i , from a pretrained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network evaluated on the image,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ψ(x, i; θ) = e w T x f i +bx .</formula><p>We trained a model using SGD with learning rate 10 −5 , momentum 0.9 and weight-decay 10 −4 , fine tuning the initial visual network, for 50 epochs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Calibration</head><p>The inference problems for both models are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">arg max y∈Y f θ (y, i) = log p(y|i; θ).</formula><p>We use the algorithm in Sec. (4) to calibrate the predictions using model θ. Our calibration tries to enforce gender statistics derived from the training set of corpus applicable for each recognition problem. For all experiments, we try to match gender ratios on the test set within a margin of .05 of their value on the training set. While we do adjust the output on the test set, we never use the ground truth on the test set and instead working from the assumption that it should be similarly distributed as the training set. When running the debiasing algorithm, we set η = 10 −1 and optimize for 100 iterations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Bias Analysis</head><p>In this section, we use the approaches outlined in Section 3 to quantify the bias and bias amplification in the vSRL and the MLC tasks.</p><p>6.1 Visual Semantic Role Labeling imSitu is gender biased In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a), along the x-axis, we show the male favoring bias of im-Situ verbs. Overall, the dataset is heavily biased toward male agents, with 64.6% of verbs favoring a male agent by an average bias of 0.707 (roughly 3:1 male). Nearly half of verbs are extremely biased in the male or female direction: 46.95% of verbs favor a gender with a bias of at least 0.7. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a) contains several activity labels revealing problematic biases. For example, shopping, microwaving and washing are biased toward a female agent. Furthermore, several verbs such as driving, shooting, and coaching are heavily biased toward a male agent.</p><p>Training on imSitu amplifies bias In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>, along the y-axis, we show the ratio of male agents (% of total people) in predictions on an unseen development set. The mean bias amplification in the development set is high, 0.050 on average, with 45.75% of verbs exhibiting amplification. Biased verbs tend to have stronger amplification: verbs with training bias over 0.7 in either the male or female direction have a mean amplification of 0.072. Several already problematic biases have gotten much worse. For example, serving, only had a small bias toward females in the training set, 0.402, is now heavily biased toward females, 0.122. The verb tuning, originally heavily biased toward males, 0.878, now has exclusively male agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Multilabel Classification</head><p>MS-COCO is gender biased In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(b) along the x-axis, similarly to imSitu, we analyze bias of objects in MS-COCO with respect to males. MS-COCO is even more heavily biased toward men than imSitu, with 86.6% of objects biased toward men, but with smaller average magnitude, 0.65. One third of the nouns are extremely biased toward males, 37.9% of nouns favor men with a bias of at least 0.7. Some problematic examples include kitchen objects such as knife, fork, or spoon being more biased toward woman. Outdoor recreation related objects such tennis racket, snowboard and boat tend to be more biased toward men. had mean amplification of 0.081. Again, several problematic biases have now been amplified. For example, kitchen categories already biased toward females such as knife, fork and spoon have all been amplified. Technology oriented categories initially biased toward men such as keyboard and mouse have each increased their bias toward males by over 0.100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Discussion</head><p>We confirmed our hypothesis that (a) both the im-Situ and MS-COCO datasets, gathered from the web, are heavily gender biased and that (b) models trained to perform prediction on these datasets amplify the existing gender bias when evaluated on development data. Furthermore, across both datasets, we showed that the degree of bias amplification was related to the size of the initial bias, with highly biased object and verb categories exhibiting more bias amplification. Our results demonstrate that care needs be taken in deploying such uncalibrated systems otherwise they could not only reinforce existing social bias but actually make them worse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Calibration Results</head><p>We test our methods for reducing bias amplification in two problem settings: visual semantic role labeling in the imSitu dataset (vSRL) and multilabel image classification in MS-COCO (MLC). In all settings we derive corpus constraints using the training set and then run our calibration method in batch on either the development or testing set. Our results are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2 and Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Visual Semantic Role Labeling</head><p>Our quantitative results are summarized in the first two sections of Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. On the development set, the number of verbs whose bias exceed the original bias by over 5% decreases 30.5% (Viol.). Overall, we are able to significantly reduce bias amplification in vSRL by 52% on the development set (Amp. bias). We evaluate the underlying recognition performance using the standard measure in vSRL: top-1 semantic role accuracy, which tests how often the correct verb was predicted and the noun value was correctly assigned to a semantic role. Our calibration method results in a negligible decrease in performance (Perf.). In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(c) we can see that the overall distance to the training set distribution after applying RBA decreased significantly, over 39%. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(e) demonstrates that across all initial training bias, RBA is able to reduce bias amplification. In general, RBA struggles to remove bias amplification in areas of low initial training bias,  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Multilabel Classification</head><p>Our quantitative results on MS-COCO RBA are summarized in the last two sections of Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>Similarly to vSRL, we are able to reduce the number of objects whose bias exceeds the original training bias by 5%, by 40% (Viol.). Bias amplification was reduced by 31.3% on the development set (Amp. bias). The underlying recognition system was evaluated by the standard measure: top-1 mean average precision, the precision averaged across object categories. Our calibration method results in a negligible loss in performance. In <ref type="bibr">Figure 3(d)</ref>, we demonstrate that we substantially reduce the distance between training bias and bias in the development set. Finally, in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(f) we demonstrate that we decrease bias amplification for all initial training bias settings. Results on the test set support our development results: we decrease bias amplification by 47.5% (Amp. bias).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Discussion</head><p>We have demonstrated that RBA can significantly reduce bias amplification. While were not able to remove all amplification, we have made significant progress with little or no loss in underlying recognition performance. Across both problems, RBA was able to reduce bias amplification at all initial values of training bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>Structured prediction models can leverage correlations that allow them to make correct predictions even with very little underlying evidence. Yet such models risk potentially leveraging social bias in their training data. In this paper, we presented a general framework for visualizing and quantifying biases in such models and proposed RBA to calibrate their predictions under two different settings. Taking gender bias as an example, our analysis demonstrates that conditional random fields can amplify social bias from data while our approach RBA can help to reduce the bias.</p><p>Our work is the first to demonstrate structured prediction models amplify bias and the first to propose methods for reducing this effect but significant avenues for future work remain. While RBA can be applied to any structured predictor, it is unclear whether different predictors amplify bias more or less. Furthermore, we presented only one method for measuring bias. More extensive analysis could explore the interaction among predictor, bias measurement, and bias deamplification method. Future work also includes applying bias reducing methods in other structured domains, such as pronoun reference resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mitkov, 2014)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1: Five example images from the imSitu visual semantic role labeling (vSRL) dataset. Each image is paired with a table describing a situation: the verb, cooking, its semantic roles, i.e agent, and noun values filling that role, i.e. woman. In the imSitu training set, 33% of cooking images have man in the agent role while the rest have woman. After training a Conditional Random Field (CRF), bias is amplified: man fills 16% of agent roles in cooking images. To reduce this bias amplification our calibration method adjusts weights of CRF potentials associated with biased predictions. After applying our methods, man appears in the agent role of 20% of cooking images, reducing the bias amplification by 25%, while keeping the CRF vSRL performance unchanged.</figDesc><graphic url="image-5.png" coords="2,316.74,153.16,106.72,106.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>

We recognize that a more fine-grained analysis would be needed for deployment in a production system. Also, note that the proposed approach can be applied to other NLP tasks and other variables such as identification with a racial or ethnic group.</note>
