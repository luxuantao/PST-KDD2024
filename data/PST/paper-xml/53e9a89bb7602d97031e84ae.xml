Tsatsanis, Member, IEEE Abstract-Constrained optimization methods have received considerable attention as a means to derive blind multiuser receivers with low complexity. The receiver's output variance is minimized subject to appropriate constraints which depend on the multipath structure of the signal of interest. When multipath is present, the constraint equations can be written in parametric form, and the constraint parameters jointly optimized with the linear receiver's parameters. In this paper, we develop adaptive solutions for this joint, constrained optimization problem. Both stochastic gradient and recursive least-square-type algorithms are developed. The performance of the proposed methods is compared with other blind and trained methods and turns out to be close to the trained minimum mean-square-error receiver.</p><p>Index Terms-Adaptive interference suppression, blind multiuser detection, code-division multiple access, constrained optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>C ODE-DIVISION multiple-access (CDMA) systems have gained popularity recently, against rival time-division multiple-access/frequency-division multiple-access (TDMA/FDMA) solutions, despite the increased complexity of the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. They are prime candidates for third-generation wide-band wireless systems, due to their improved bandwidth efficiency and flexibility. In the CDMA framework, different users employ distinct spreading codes but transmit at the same time and frequency. Therefore, multiuser interference (MUI) exists at the received signal, reducing the performance and creating "near-far" effects.</p><p>Significant effort has focused recently on designing multiuser receivers in order to suppress MUI and deliver the promised capacity gains of CDMA technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. While optimal solutions have been derived <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, their exponentially increasing complexity renders them inappropriate for systems with a large number of users. For this reason, recent efforts have concentrated on suboptimal linear solutions and have investigated ways to derive the receiver parameters from the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Multiuser receiver design can be divided into two categories based on whether training sequences are used or not. In the first category, nonblind Minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) receivers can be adaptively implemented if the desired signal is known at the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, while in the second category, a blind approach has to be employed. Blind subspace methods show good performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, but the required singular value decomposition (SVD) of large matrices leads to a heavy computational load. On the contrary, blind adaptive multiuser detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> significantly reduce the computational burden.</p><p>A scheme was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for the case when multipath interference is absent and showed performance equivalent to that of the MMSE receiver. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, an adaptive implementation based on a subspace tracking method was shown to improve performance at the expense of more computational complexity. The method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> was later extended by adding more constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Unfortunately, in the presence of multipath and multichip interference, minimum variance solutions are known to be sensitive to signature mismatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A solution for that case was attempted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and later in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, by forcing the receiver response to delayed copies of the signal of interest to zero. With these additional constraints, minimum variance techniques are applicable, but have inferior performance since they treat part of the useful signal as interference.</p><p>Recently however, constrained optimization solutions were developed which combine all multipath components of the signal of interest and jointly minimize MUI while maximizing the signal component at the receiver's output <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. A related development from a different viewpoint was also reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>These blind methods exhibit superior performance which is close to that of the trained MMSE receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Unfortunately however, adaptive implementations of the solution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> are not straightforward, as they correspond to the optimization of a nonlinear cost function.</p><p>The goal of the current paper is to derive blind adaptive receivers for a multiuser CDMA communication system with reduced complexity by employing constrained optimization techniques. We recursively minimize the output variance of the received signal subject to certain constraints which are also jointly updated. Three different algorithms are proposed in this paper from different viewpoints. Two variations of constrained least mean-square (LMS) methods are obtained by integrating ideas from array processing (see Frost's adaptive method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). Another adaptive algorithm corresponding to the generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) structure is also presented, which can be thought as an updating rule of the equivalent problem without constraints. These stochastic gradient-based methods suffer from slow convergence as most LMS algorithms do, which offsets their low computational complexity. Therefore the last version of our algorithms with faster convergence is built upon recursive least-square (RLS) ideas.</p><p>In contrast with past work in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the current method can operate in multipath environments by taking into account all multipath components of the signal of interest. Our method also has advantages over the receiver of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in the sense that it only updates the coefficients for one filter without using a RAKE receiver structure.</p><p>Despite their lower computational complexity however, it turns out that the proposed algorithms exhibit improved performance. Furthermore, it is shown in the sequel that they enjoy global convergence. Simulation results further support these claims according to comparisons with trained MMSE as well as other blind receivers.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The discrete-time model of a multiuser CDMA system is described in Section II. Constrained minimum variance techniques are reviewed in Section III in preparation for the development of the proposed adaptive methods. Constrained LMS algorithms are derived in Sections IV and V, while GSC-based and RLS-based methods are obtained in Sections VI and VII, respectively. In Section VIII, the convergence of our algorithms is studied while some simulation results are presented in Section IX. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in the last section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>In the direct-sequence (DS) CDMA framework, each user transmits digital information after modulating it by a distinct spreading sequence. Let user , use a spreading code , of length to transmit chips/information symbol. Let the chip sequence be transmitted through a linear channel with a baseband impulse response 1 (including the transmitter and receiver filters), and let the receiver collect samples/chip. Then, the received discrete-time signal due to user is (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where is sampled impulse response of the multipath channel, is the signature of user [the 1 We use subscript c to denote continuous-time signals.</p><p>convolution of the code with the channel-see (2)], is the chip period and is the delay of user in chip periods. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> The received signal at the receiver is a superposition of the signals from all users plus noise where is assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero-mean and variance . Without loss of generality, we may assume that the delay . We will also assume that has finite impulse response of maximum order (typically in many applications). Finally, each user's information bearing sequence</p><p>) is zeromean, i.i.d., independent of other users with variance . Let us collect measurements of in a vector (</p><p>). If we consider a single sample per chip ( ), and if the receiver is synchronized to user 1 (</p><p>), then signal due to user 1 is <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref>where is the collection of measurements of and is the signature vector of user 1, and are signatures of the bits . The signal due to other asynchronous users ( and ) is where and are signatures from the other interfering users. If we consider the superposition of all users, the received signal will be <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where is the signal of interest, while , , and are interference and noise components, respectively.</p><p>Furthermore, notice that the signature of user 1 can be decomposed as [c.f. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref> </p><p>and is the unknown multipath parameter vector for user 1. This structure of the user's signature will be exploited in this paper to derive blind adaptive multiuser receivers with the ability to accommodate multipath distortions. In order to construct the code filtering matrix , we assume that the receiver is synchronized to user 1 and the maximum channel order (or an upper bound of it) is also available. We will focus on adaptive implementation of the minimum variance batch approach developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. As will become clear soon, adaptive solutions to this problem are nontrivial due to the nonlinear nature of the cost function. But let us first briefly revisit the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CONSTRAINED MINIMUM VARIANCE RECEIVERS</head><p>If we focus on linear solutions, the receiver design problem is equivalent to determining a parameter vector which provides an estimate of the desired signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> Vector has the same length as the data vector . In the case of severe multipath, it is conceivable that the model of (3) can be extended to have span multiple bit intervals, resulting in a longer receiver vector. In the interest of clarity, we will maintain the model of ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) in the sequel.</p><p>The receiver vector may be optimized by minimizing the output variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (7) subject to the constraint that the response of the user of the interest is a constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> This approach was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> in the absence of multipath, in which case the signature coincides with the user's code and is a priori known. Similar ideas have been extensively studied in array processing in the context of minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>In the multipath case, an extended set of constraints can be used (one constraint for each delayed copy of the signal) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> (9)</p><p>where is a parameter vector to be determined.

In this paper, we derive adaptive algorithms for estimating and by directly optimizing the Lagrangian cost function and avoiding the inversion of . Both stochastic gradient and RLS solutions are investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PROPOSED CONSTRAINED LMS ALGORITHM: METHOD I</head><p>Let us consider the Lagrangian cost function parameterized by and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where and are the Lagrange multipliers. Notice that we fix in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Since we wish to minimize <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> with respect to and maximize it with respect to , we consider the following gradient search procedures: (13) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where , are two step sizes. The gradients in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) may be obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> as , , respectively. Then, ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) become (15) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where and also need to be updated at each iteration. In order to avoid buildup of roundoff errors in constrained optimization problems, it was suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to update the Lagrange multipliers in such a way that constraints are satisfied at Substituting ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, we arrive at the updating rule for <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> It can be seen that is needed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, hence an update equation for should be derived as well.</p><p>If we substitute ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), we obtain an update equation for as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> To get the final update equation for , we need to determine the unknown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Following the ideas of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> once more, we impose the quadratic constraint on <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> at each iteration. Substituting (20) in ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>), a second-order equation for is obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> where (24) There may be two real solutions if the discriminant of ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) is nonnegative, that is, . Then, we choose the smaller of the two solutions for as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> for reasons that will become clear later. The case of corresponds to incompatible linear and quadratic constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, for certain constrained problems. In our case, however, the optimal solution for is guaranteed for every [cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>] and therefore the constraints are compatible (at least in the neighborhood of the optimal point). Once is obtained, can be updated according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. However, no update for should be performed in the occasional situation when . Finally, by using an instantaneous approximation for , we arrive at a constrained LMS type algorithm. The steps of the algorithm are summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p><p>In this algorithm, all constraints are explicitly considered in one cost function. As will be seen, this will facilitate our theoretical analysis. However, the quadratic constraint on results in a second-order equation for which has to be solved at each iteration. In order to avoid the extra computations, one might try to abolish the constraint on the norm of and instead normalize at each iteration. This approach results in a different variation of our LMS algorithm, which is discussed next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. PROPOSED CONSTRAINED LMS ALGORITHM: METHOD II</head><p>Let us write our Lagrangian cost function now as <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> where is the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to constraints for our receiver . Then two update equations for and can be formed as (27) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> which will adaptively minimize with respect to and maximize with respect to . Since a change in the length of does not affects the performance of the receiver [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>)], we may project onto the space orthogonal to to obtain the following equation to update :</p><p>(29) In order to guarantee the constraint at each iteration, we will normalize by (30)</p><p>By using ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) become</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(31) (32)</formula><p>The Lagrange multiplier is again obtained by enforcing the constraint and the result is identical to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. By substituting <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>   <ref type="formula">33</ref>)-(35) together with (30) and using the instantaneous approximation for , we obtain our simpler constrained LMS method, which is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. BLIND ADAPTIVE GSC ALGORITHM: METHOD III</head><p>In beamforming and array processing literature, linearly constrained optimization problems are often transformed into unconstrained ones. This leads to the separation of the mainlobe (signal part) from the sidelobe (noise part) by using the so-called GSC structure for the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In our problem, we have a linear constraint for the receiver as and a quadratic constraint for the constraint vector . We can partition this problem into two parts, one part corresponding to the linear constraint which can be transformed to an unconstrained one, the other part corresponding to the normalization step. Following this idea, we begin our derivation by analyzing the matrix first.</p><p>As can be seen by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">5</ref>), the columns of are shifted versions of the spreading code of the user of interest, so they are linearly independent and make up a signal subspace basis (not necessarily orthogonal). If we consider the matrix whose columns represent a basis for the orthogonal complement of the space spanned by the columns of , then the columns of and span the entire space, and we can express any vector in this space as (36) Matrix can be obtained by using SVD on the matrix and collecting eigenvectors corresponding to null eigenvalues. Applying the constraint to (36) yields , and therefore . Then (36) may be written as (37)</p><p>In (37), we have managed to parameterize by and in such a way that the constraints are guaranteed to be satisfied. Using this parameterization, we may transform our constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained one for . We still use the output variance as our cost function . According to (37), can be expanded as (38)</p><p>We want to minimize with respect to and maximize it with respect to . Therefore, we may construct two update equations for and , respectively  in order to guarantee that the quadratic constraint for is satisfied. Then, based on (37), our receiver vector at iteration can be constructed as respectively. We can thus summarize this LMS-GSC algorithm in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. PROPOSED RLS ALGORITHM: METHOD IV</head><p>All three algorithms we have developed in Sections IV-VI (Methods I-III) are stochastic gradient-based methods where the instantaneous approximation for the data covariance matrix is used. When communication channels experience fast frequency-selective fading, the structure of the interference may change drastically in short time. Hence, this approximation becomes more inaccurate. Furthermore, various near-far situations and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios may affect the eigenvalue spread of . Thus, all previous methods may experience slow convergence rates in some cases. For this reason, we explore RLS-based solutions with faster convergence in the sequel despite their higher computational complexity.</p><p>Motivated by the optimal solutions for the receiver and our constraint vector in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, respectively, we need to compute recursively to facilitate the computation of the eigenvector of the matrix corresponding to its maximum eigenvalue (or the eigenvector of the matrix corresponding to its minimum eigenvalue) while reducing the number of computations. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we can use Kalman RLS recursions to update as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(50)<label>(51)</label></formula><p>where is the forgetting factor. The algorithm can be initialized by where is a large positive number. In this way, and thus are Hermitian. Once is updated, we can form the matrix . Since the latter is a small size matrix with dimension (recall under our assumption), its eigenvector corresponding to its minimum eigenvalue may be obtained by directly applying SVD decomposition. The embedded arbitrary phase, inherent in obtaining from SVD, may affect the continuity of the receiver vectors for successive 's. It might be advisable therefore to normalize the phase of by setting the phase of one of its elements to zero. Alternatively, subspace tracking procedures may be employed to further reduce the computations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Finally, by utilizing the formula [c.f. ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)] (52) we can obtain the receiver at iteration . The steps of this method are summarized in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref>.</p><p>There are more efficient ways to update the matrix (e.g., using Cholesky factors <ref type="bibr">[8, p. 408]</ref>), but we will not discuss them here due to lack of space. Instead, we will turn our attention to convergence issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we investigate the convergence behavior of our algorithms in terms of global/local minima, trajectory of the mean receiver vector (or tap vector) and the steady-state excess mean square error (MSE). We focus on Method I with all constraints in a single cost function as more convenient for analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE IV PROPOSED RLS ALGORITHM: METHOD IV</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Global Convergence</head><p>The output variance is a quadratic function of which might lead one to think that the issue of global convergence is a trivial one. In the current situation, however, has to be jointly optimized with [cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>] and the presence of local minima can not be a priori dismissed.</p><p>By studying the first as well as the second derivatives of the cost function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, it is shown in Appendix I that our algorithm guarantees a unique convergent point for ( , ). Any other stationary points are unstable except the desired optimum point. Therefore, the proposed algorithm enjoys global convergence, and thus imposes no restrictions on initialization. Next, we study other properties of the proposed algorithms in terms of the mean tap vector and excess steady-state MSE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Trajectory of the Mean Tap Vector and Constraint Vector</head><p>To proceed, let us first define the tap error vector and the constraint error vector at time</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(53)</formula><p>where is the optimal constraint vector which is the eigenvector of matrix corresponding to its maximum eigenvalue , and is the optimal receiver given by (54)</p><p>These two error vectors have to be considered together because of the joint optimization procedure. It is shown in Appendix II that their trajectory abides by the following equation:</p><p>where , " " represents expectation and matrix A is shown in the equation at the bottom of the page. Equation (55) implies that the stability of the proposed method depends on the stability of matrix . Therefore, the step sizes , should be chosen such that the eigenvalues of have magnitude less than one. Unfortunately, the problem is further involved due to the presence of in ; is not updated through a linear recursion and the study of its trajectory is intractable. Still, some insight on the stability of the algorithm in the neighborhood of the desired solution can be obtained by letting . Equation (55) also indicates some necessary conditions on the step sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Trajectory of Excess MSE</head><p>Our method is a minimum output energy (MOE) approach and its steady-state excess MSE analysis follows the general steps presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, although the latter deals with the nonfrequency-selective channel. In the current context, however, the multipath channel is taken into account.</p><p>Let the MSE at time be (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) (56) By noticing that and using the independence assumption, (56) becomes (57) where is the MSE with optimal receiver and (58) </p><p>The second term in (59) is the steady-state excess MSE due to adaptation. If we denote it by , then it is related to the tap vector error by (60) It is shown in Appendix III that is determined by the secondand fourth-order statistics of the received data vector , namely (61) where and " " represents the Kronecker product, " " is the "vec" operation to arrange all elements of a matrix into a vector along column-wise. Without further assumptions, the expression of (61) is quite involved due to the high-order statistics of the data . However, it can be seen that increases almost linearly with the step size , similar to the result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>It is true that the convergence properties of the adaptive algorithm highly depend on the variations of the communication environment. The algorithm may fail to track the fast changing channel if the adaptation speed is too slow. Thus, the step size should be chosen as a compromise between excess error and convergence rate to make the algorithm more suitable for a particular communication scenario. The choice of step size is also affected by the dimension of the constraint subspace in the current context. When a long channel is experienced which consequently increases the dimension of constraint vector, the receiver vector has less freedom to be adjusted. Then, inferior performance could be expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. SIMULATIONS</head><p>The applicability and performance of the different proposed methods were verified by our simulation results. We used the average output signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver end as a performance index, and we compared our methods with the trained MMSE receiver and the receivers presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which are both MOE-based methods. A CDMA system was simulated with quadrature phase-shift keying modulation and ten users in a 15-dB AWGN environment. Gold sequences of length 31 were used as code sequences. All inputs took values from where . User 1 was assumed to be the desired user which was 5 dB weaker than each of the other nine equal-power users. The receiver was synchronized to this user. Signals from other users arriving at the receiver with arbitrary delays between 0-31 chip periods. Channel vectors for all users were also randomly generated. Fifty Monte Carlo runs were performed for each experiment with bits/realization. The input sequences, the AWGN sequence, and the channel vectors changed from one realization to another, while other parameters were kept unchanged to obtain the average results.</p><p>First, we compared four different proposed methods (see Tables I-IV for methods I-IV) and show the corresponding output SINR in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(a)-(d)</ref>, respectively. The initial values were set to be , , and . The step sizes for updating these vectors were , . In implementing Method IV, , . It can be seen that Methods I-III have similar performance. However, Method IV shows better performance at the expense of increased computational cost. This result is not surprising if we investigate the recursive behavior of our constraint vector . Motivated by the analysis result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> that this vector will asymptotically converge to the normalized channel vector within a phase ambiguity, we also compare it with by using the phase of (the first element in ) as a reference to remove the ambiguity. Thus, the MSEs of channel estimates were obtained and are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3(a)-(d)</ref>. Again similar convergence properties are observed for Methods I-III, while Method IV gives lower error level with the same iteration.</p><p>Next, we tested the AWGN effect on the performance of one of our algorithms (Method I) to gain some insight. We obtained the SINR in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4(a)-(d</ref>) by adding Gaussian noise to the system with different levels such as 5, 10, 15, and 20 dB. When dB, the SINR converges to 0 dB. For other three SNR levels, the output SINR converges to 4, 6, and 8 dB, respectively. These improvement are also reflected by the channel estimation errors for these four different situations, as indicated by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5(a)-(d)</ref>. When dB, the MSE of channel estimate converges to 7 10 , while 2 10 , 0.9 10 , 0.7 10 convergence levels are observed for and dB, respectively. It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> that as , the constraint vector will eventually converge to within a phase ambiguity. Thus, the vector can be used to estimate the multipath channel when the background is almost "noise-free."</p><p>Our next experiment was performed to show how our algorithm behaves in a near-far communication environment. All parameters are the same as those for Method I in the first experiment except the relative power for the desired user (user 1). Three cases were tested where the power equals or is 5 dB weaker or 10 dB weaker than each of the other nine equally-powered interfering users. The simulation results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref> for SINR and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref> for the channel estimation MSE. Solid lines are for the 0 dB weaker (or equal power) case, dash-dotted lines for the 5 dB weaker case, and dashed lines for the 10 dB weaker one. It can be seen from both figures that the transition and convergence rates of the method are different in different cases. When all users are assigned equal power (or under power control), the algorithm converges much faster (about 300 iterations are required), while it requires more than 3000 iterations to converge when user 1 is much weaker (10 dB weaker). However, either SINR or channel estimation MSE converges to approximately the same level despite the different power assignments. Therefore, the algorithm exhibits near-far resistance according to our experimental results.</p><p>Next, we compare Method I with the nonblind MMSE receiver, the MOE-based adaptive multiuser detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (simply called MOE) and the adaptive orthogonally anchored MMSE (OAMMSE) detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in terms of the output SINR. All algorithms were implemented with the same step size 0.0009 and initial values to have a fair comparison. User 1 is still 5 dB weaker in power. The equal-gain combining (EGC) technique was used for <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. All results are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>. In the order from top to bottom after 500 iterations, the dashed, solid, dashdotted, and dotted lines represent the results for MMSE, the  proposed, OAMMSE, and MOE, respectively. Different convergence levels can be seen from this figure. After 3000 iterations, they reach 8, 4.5, 3, and 12 dB, respectively. It is clear that the proposed method can compensate for multipath effect and suppress MUI successfully even in the near-far situation. Our method also performs closer to the trained MMSE receiver, but about 4-dB loss is observed. This performance loss is explained by the greater misadjustment of the blind method due to the fact that the blind cost function is orders of magnitude greater than the MSE one, even at the optimum point. However, our method shows better result than that of OAMMSE (about 1.5-dB difference) for the current setup. One major reason behind this is that our method can somehow estimate the channel parameters adaptively, while without the knowledge for the channel, the EGC technique used in OAMMSE does not always provide satisfactory results for various communication systems with multipath  distortions. If we look into the computational complexity for these two methods, it can be found that extra steps have to be taken to update the constraint vector in the proposed method, which results in additional complexity of about . This extra cost is not significant if the channel order is small. But in high speed data communications it becomes not negligible. Since the MOE algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> was developed for flat channels, it is no surprise that it does not work well in the presence of multipath distortions.</p><p>The last experiment was performed to test the performance of our method (Method I) in a Rayleigh fading communication environment. All ten users in the system were assumed to have equal power, and the receiver was synchronized to user 1. The channel parameters for user 1 were obtained by sampling the following continuous function generated from a two-ray Rayleigh fading model (see <ref type="bibr">[17, ch. 4]</ref>)  , are two independent complex Gaussian processes with unit power. They were generated by passing i.i.d. white Gaussian inputs through a Doppler filter with cutoff frequency equal to the maximum Doppler shift (for details, see <ref type="bibr">[17, ch. 4]</ref>). Delay of the second path was equal to 2.8 chip periods. A square pulse shaping function was employed. The symbol rate was set to 48.6 kb/s and the maximum Doppler shift to 100 Hz. Channel parameters for the asynchronous interfering users were also similarly simulated resulting in a time-varying interference structure. Other parameters were same as in the first experiment. The average output SINR of the proposed receiver for 1000 realizations versus number of iterations is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>. It can be observed that the algorithm is capable of tracking the time-varying channel and suppressing the time-varying interference.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

LMS-and RLS-based constrained optimization methods are developed, which jointly optimize the receiver and constraint parameters.
