<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents several aspects of the application of regularization theory in image restoration. This is accomplished by extending the applicability of the stabilizing functional approach to 2-D ill-posed inverse problems. Image restoration is formulated as the constrained minimization of a stabilizing functional. The choice of a particular quadratic functional to be minimized is related to the a priori knowledge regarding the original object through a formulation of image restoration as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem. This formulation is based on image representation by certain stochastic partial differential equation image models. The analytical study and computational treatment of the resulting optimization problem are subsequently presented. As a result, a variety of regularizing filters and iterative regularizing algorithms are proposed. A relationship between the regularized solutions proposed and optimal Wiener estimation is also identified. The filters and algorithms proposed are evaluated through several experimental results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>HE image formation process is commonly formulated by the following linear model [ 11, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A f + n = g (1.1)</formula><p>T</p><p>where f is the original object, g is the observed image, and n is the additive noise due to the image recording system. A is a linear operator describing the degradation associated with the image formation. Image restoration is the process of inferring the best possible estimate for the original object f , given the observed image g. When the image formation is described by a continuous spacevariant linear model, (1.1) corresponds to the following integral equation [ 11:   ss h ( u , U , x , Y ) f ( X , Y ) dY + n ( u , U ) = g ( u , U )</p><p>(1.2) where h ( * ) is a function of four variables, describing positions in both object and image spaces, also known as point spreadfuncrion (PSF) in the literature [l]. In the case of a space-invariant continuous formulation, (1.2) corresponds to 2-D convolution. When the image formation is described by a discrete model, (1. l ) corresponds to the following matrix-vector equation [ 11:</p><p>A f + n = g. <ref type="bibr">(1.3)</ref> Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">June I , 1988</ref>; revised August 2 , 1989.</p><p>The authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering. Univer-IEEE Log Number 9035657.</p><p>sity of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S IA4.</p><p>In (1.3), fand g are vectors consisting of the lexicographically ordered elements of the object and image, respectively, and n is the noise vector. The degradation associated with the image formation is described in (1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>) by the matrix A , also referred to as point spread matrix (PSM) in the literature <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref>.</p><p>An inverse problem is characterized as ill-posed when there is no guarantee for the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution based on direct inversion. The solution of an inverse problem is not guaranteed to be stable if a small perturbation of the data can produce a large effect in the solution. Image restoration belongs to a general class of problems that were rigorously classified as ill-posed problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. An even more intuitive reasoning about the ill-posed nature of the problem can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Regularization theory (RT) provides a formal basis for the development of regularized solutions of ill-posed problems. The basic elements of RT were presented by Tikhonov et <ref type="bibr">al. in [3]</ref>. In [ 5 ] , Nashed emphasized the relationship between regularization and generalized inverses. The stabilizing functional approach is one of the basic methodologies for the development of regularized solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. According to this approach, an ill-posed problem can be formulated as the constrained minimization of a certain functional, called stabilizing functional.</p><p>The specific constraints imposed by the stabilizing functional approach on the solution depend on the form and the properties of the stabilizing functional used. From the nature of the problem, these constraints are necessarily related to the a priori information regarding the expected regularized solution.</p><p>Although the basic concepts within RT are well defined, there exists some confusion in the literature regarding RT. The use of the word "regularization" by some authors generates often the false impression that RT is restricted to the minimum norm solution of ill-posed inverse problems only. On the other hand, it seems to be commonly believed that RT is restricted to the stabilizing functional approach only. However, a variety of alternative regularized solutions can be determined on the basis of the general and even more abstract concept of the regularizing operator (RO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In fact, the stabilizing func- tional approach is a particular methodology in constructing RO's. An extensive study of the application of the RO approach in image restoration was presented by the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>0096-35 18/90/0700-1 155$0 1 .OO 0 1990 IEEE IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH. AND SIGNAL PROCESSING. VOL <ref type="bibr">38. NO 7. JULY 1990</ref> One of the earliest image restoration approaches motivated by RT was the application of cubic splines in image restoration, presented by <ref type="bibr">Hou and Andrews in [7]</ref>. Some remarks regarding the application of RT in image restoration were also reported by Hunt in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">More recently, Katsaggelos et al. presented</ref> an image restoration approach using some elements of <ref type="bibr">RT [8]</ref>. However, the number of image restoration approaches that were directly motivated by RT is only a small portion of the image restoration approaches that can be related to <ref type="bibr">RT.</ref> In fact, there exist several constrained image restoration approaches that can be classified as special applications of the stabilizing functional approach. The simplest, and rather primitive, one is the minimum norm image restoration approach. In this case, the stabilizing functional is simply the norm of the original object. It is shown in this paper that the entire family of constrained least squares approaches <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> can be related to the stabilizing functional approach. More specifically, any constrained least squares formulation of the image restoration problem can be obtained from the stabilizing functional approach by using a quadratic stabilizing functional of a special form. Finally, the relationship between maximum entropy (ME) image restoration <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, [ 1 11 and the stabilizing functional approach is of particular interest. The stabilizing functional approach amounts to the ME formulation of the image restoration problem, provided that the negative entropy functional is used as stabilizing functional. The above relationship is a clear indication that, in general, the stabilizing functional approach amounts to nonlinear regularized solutions of image restoration. The computational requirements associated with the implementation of ME image restoration, in conjunction with the huge amount of data typically involving in image restoration, provide an indication of the computational difficulties that could arise from the use of global nonquadratic stabilizing functionals.</p><p>Image restoration is not the only inverse problem that can be formulated as the minimization of a certain functional, or equivalently, as variational principles. Variational principles recently attracted the attention of many researchers in the area of image processing and low level computer vision [ 121. Some of the problems formulated using variational principles were edge detection <ref type="bibr">[ 131-[ 151, determination of optical flow [16]</ref>, and the shape from shading problem [ 171. The use of variational principles in visual surface interpolation, originally proposed by <ref type="bibr">Grimson in [ 181 and [19]</ref>, is of particular interest here. In [ 191, the visual surface interpolation problem was formulated as the constrained minimization of a certain quadratic functional. A computational treatment of the resulting optimization problem was reported by Crimson in <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. The role of quadratic functionals based on rotationally symmetric differential operators was studied by <ref type="bibr">Brady and Horn in [21]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">In [22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>, Terzopoulos presented the study of several analytical and computational aspects regarding the application of variational principles in visual surface interpolation.</p><p>The minimization of a quadratic functional is the common point of all the above approaches. In <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>, Terzo-poulos presented some arguments regarding the undesirable effects caused by the use of quadratic functionals in visual reconstruction problems that arise in early vision. One of the basic ones was that the global smoothness constraints imposed by the use of quadratic functionals cannot guarantee the preservation of certain discontinuities that play an important role in vision. Based on this argument, he proposed a class of stabilizing functionals for piecewise continuous regularization, called controlledcontinuity stabilizers. In addition to a general analytical study regarding the use of such stabilizers, he also discussed several alternatives related to the computational treatment of the resulting optimization problem. Although the original idea is an attractive alternative to standard regularization, it seems that there exist certain difficulties in the application level. In other words, the derivation of clearly specified and easily reproducible algorithms based on such stabilizers is still an open problem. In particular, a possible use of such stabilizers in image restoration should necessarily overcome certain problems related to the local nature of the constraints imposed by such a formulation, given the representation of the image formation by a global model.</p><p>In a recent publication [25], Pavlidis reported some useful comments on the use of variational principles in image processing and low level computer vision. According to this author, one of the most important problems to be investigated is the justification of the choice of a particular functional in a given application. The necessary constraint in choosing the functional to be minimized is the one imposed by the mathematical problem itself, that is, the requirement that the functional to be chosen possesses a minimum. Another important factor that usually affects the choice of a particular functional relates to the analytical difficulties and computational requirements resulting from this particular choice. However, there are not generally accepted rules for the particular choice of a functional that reflects the nature of the given physical problem. To date, the formulation of certain problems as variational principles was mostly based on the constrained minimization of quadratic functionals. The only attempt to introduce nonquadratic functionals emphasizing local features of the image was the one, mentioned above, by <ref type="bibr">Terzopoulos.</ref> On the other hand, ME image restoration can be interpreted as the only image restoration approach that is based on the minimization of a global nonquadratic functional. In general, there exist several problems associated with the use of global nonquadratic functionals. One of the most important problems is the justification of the use of a particular nonquadratic functional. In fact, there is no guarantee that the use of a global nonquadratic functional can efficiently prevent local discontinuities in the image. This seems to be one of the reasons for the lack of a generally accepted nonlinear theory in image restoration. On the other hand, the global model that describes the image formation clearly distinguishes image restoration from other similar problems as, for instance, the problem of image filtering when there is no distortion associated with the image formation but additive noise. Most of the proposed nonlinear filtering techniaues were based on local processing by employing certain nonlinear operators that can effectively reduce the noise, while simultaneously preserve local discontinuities <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. Such nonlinear techniques provided remarkable results, at least for some kinds of non-Gaussian noise. However, the application of local nonlinear processing in image restoration is restricted by the requirement that the resulting restoration technique should also efficiently deal with the global nature of the inversion problem. Not surprisingly, it is particularly difficult to identify in the literature any particular nonlinear image restoration technique that is widely accepted, or used as a reference by the researchers in the area.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows: In Section 11, image restoration is formulated on the basis of the stabilizing functional approach as the constrained minimization of a certain stabilizing functional. The remainder of this section presents a systematic search for stabilizing functionals among the elements of a general class of functionals. The study of a certain class of quadratic functionals is particularly emphasized. Section I11 presents an extensive study of the unconstrained minimization problem, obtained from the original constrained one using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The minimization problem resulting from the continuous formulation of the image restoration problem is initially studied. The remainder of this section is devoted to the discrete formulation of the problem. The discrete approximation of a certain class of quadratic functionals is obtained by using the finite element method. In Section IV, the selection of specific stabilizing functionals is based on a particular formulation of image restoration as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation problem. This formulation allows a stochastic interpretation of the strictly deterministic stabilizing functional approach. As a result, the choice of stabilizing functionals is related to the image representation by stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) image models. Section V presents the derivation of a class of Regularizing Filters (RF's) based on the stabilizing functional approach. A generalization of this class of filters is subsequently proposed, resulting in a class of generalized regularizing filters (GRF's). Section VI presents the derivation of several well-determined and easily reproducible algorithms for discrete image restoration. Section VI1 investigates the relationship between the class of regularized solutions proposed in this paper and optimal Wiener estimation. In Section VIII, several experimental results are presented, compared, and discussed. Section IX contains concluding remarks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Stabilizing Functionals</head><p>A continuous functional is a mapping from a space of functions to the real numbers. In particular, a nonnegative functional is a mapping to the nonnegative real numbers. It was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> that the solution of ill-posed inverse problems can be achieved by the constrained minimization of a functional satisfying certain properties, called stabilizing @fictional. Consider the inverse problem defined by (1. l). The concept of the stabilizing functional is now introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Let Q [ f ] be the continuous nonnegative functional defined on a subspace F of a certain space F, and a) the solution f* of (1.1) belongs to the domain of</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">definition of Q [ f ] ;</formula><p>b) for every positive E , the set of elementsfof F for which where 11 . 11 is the L2-norm and 6 is a positive constant to be chosen.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Q [ f ] 5 E is a compact subset in F.</formula><p>The definition of the stabilizing functional given above is very general. However, an open question remains unanswered concerning the choice of stabilizing functionals for 2-D ill-posed problems. Since the choice of the stabilizing functional or the class of stabilizing functionals is the key issue in this approach, the problem is further investigated. In the analysis which follows, a general and very broad class of functionals is considered as the source of possible stabilizing functionals.</p><p>Let C ' K -L ' [RI be the space of all continuous smooth functions (i.e., continuous functions with continuous partial derivatives up to order ( K , L ) ) in the region of interest R.

Therefore, for a certain class of functionals, it should be replaced by a more specific and applicable condition. This can be achieved by appropriately developing the definition of the second variation of functionals [27], <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. A basic, although simple, example is the necessary condition for one-variable functionals of a specific form known as Legendre theorem <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. An analogous condition, appropriate for the class of functionals defined by <ref type="bibr">(2.4)</ref>, was presented in <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The condition <ref type="bibr">(2.8</ref>) is crucial for the selection of the stabilizing functionals among the elements of 9.

Then, (2.10) amounts to the following class of nonnegative quadratic functionals: \ These functionals can be seen as the direct extension into two variables of the corresponding one-variable functionals proposed by Tikhonov to be used as stabilizing functionals in 1-D problems [ 3 ] . A particular class of Tikhonov-type functionals, also known as spline functionals, was used in a variety of engineering applications [24]. A spline functional of order M can be obtained from (2.24) <ref type="table">2 5 )</ref> 7P.Sas follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">K L K , L &gt; 0, XK,L # 0 ( 2 .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">1 1 L ~I I &gt; o iff # 0.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">i f M = K + Land i f p + q = M i f p + q # M ( 2 .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">( 2 .</formula></div>

The particular quadratic functional used determines the form of this integro-differential equation. For a given quadratic stabilizing functional, the analytical treatment of (3.4) depends on the model describing the image formation process. Under the assumption that the image formation process can be described by a space-invariant model, (3.4) can be treated using Fourier transform techniques [38]. In general, the solution of (3.4) can be attempted using approximation methods. An obvious and rather simple approach is the discrete approximation of (3.4) using the finite difference method [39]. However, the solution of (3.4) using the finite difference method entails certain disadvantages. A qualitative evaluation of this method can be found in [23]. In this paper, the general problem is alternatively formulated directly in its discrete form.</p></div>

In the analysis which follows, the form of this discrete approximation is determined using the finite element method, which is the most appropriate one for this type of problems [40].

REGULARIZED SOLUTIONS BASED ON MAP ESTIMATION</head><p>This section presents the MAP estimation interpretation for a class of regularized solutions based on the stabilizing functional approach. The analysis which follows relates the stabilizing functional used in the minimization problem with the description of the a priori knowledge regarding the original image [43]. The importance of this analysis is twofold. First, it provides a stochastic interpretation for the entire family of constrained least squares approaches which have appeared in the literature. On the other hand, it constructs the necessary background for the development of a variety of regularized solutions reflecting the stochastic nature of the image restoration problem.</p><p>The concept of the MAP estimation has already been used in an attempt to solve the image restoration problem <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref>. There exist two main points which can be underlined about the existing MAP estimation approaches in image restoration. In terms of the formulation of the MAP estimation problem followed, the key issue is the description of the a priori knowledge assumed for the original object. In terms of the algorithms produced, the key issue is the statistical information required for the object and the noise.</p><p>Let f be the object to be estimated and g the observed data, i.e., the recorded image. Th,e MAP estimate of the object is defined [44] as that f = fMAP for which I n p ( g / f ) + l.P(f) + max ( 4 . 1 ) wherep( g / f ) is the pdf for the data g given the original object and p ( f ) is the pdf of the object. In (4.1), In p ( g / f ) expresses the probabilistic dependence of g onf, while In p ( f ) is the a priori knowledge regarding the original object.</p><p>The description of the a priori knowledge regarding the original object is very crucial in the MAP estimation approach [43]. The specific pdf of the object chosen determines the statistical information that is necessary for the implementation of the resulting MAP restoration algorithm. The pdf which is frequently used for the description of the a priori knowledge existing for the object is the following <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref>:</p><p>( 0, + a 2 ) ( D, + ai ) Hyperbolic Hyperbolic Wave 1 1 quation wherefis the mean and A is the covariance matrix of the object f. When the a priori knowledge regarding the original object is described by (4.2), the second-order statistics of the object are assumed to be known. However, this assumption is far away from the reality in most practical situations.</p><p>Jain, looking beyond the conventional covariance models used to approximate the second-order statistics of the image, proposed in [45] that the images can be represented by SPDE image models. Without entering into a detailed discussion, the general concept of image representation using SPDE models is briefly described here. Consider the following PDE: Certain SPDE image models were also proposed in [45] and evaluated in terms of their performance in representing different kinds of images. These models are presented in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">L ( 4 n 0.J U ( X &gt; Y &gt; = U(X, Y &gt;</formula><p>In image restoration, it is commonly considered that the recorded image is contaminated by additive noise due to the image formation system, that is, n = Afg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(4.5)</head><p>Given that the object fand the degradation operator A are fixed, the conditional pdf of the recorded image g given the original object f can be equivalently expressed as the pdf of the noise process n associated with the image formation system. Assuming that the noise due to the image formation system is a white Gaussian process with variance U : , p ( g / f ) is given by where k l is a positive constant depending on on.</p><p>Assume now that the a priori knowledge existing for the image is that it can be described by the SPDE model given in (4.4). Assume, in addition, that the white noise process E ( ) is also Gaussian with variance u f . Given the PDO L ( . ) used for the representation of the image, the image processf ( * ) is uniquely related with the noise process E ( * ) by (4.4). Therefore, under this assumption, the pdf p ( f ) of the image is in fact the pdf of the noise process E ( -) associated with this specific image representa-tion. Taking into account the assumption that E ( * ) is a Gaussian white noise process <ref type="table">Combining (4.6)</ref> and<ref type="table">(4.7) with (4.1</ref>), it can easily be shown that the MAP estimate is the particular ?MAP E C'K*L' [RI which minimizes the following functional:</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">M , [ f , 81 = 1 1 4 -gl12 + a/JLfl12 (4.8)</formula><p>where a is a positive constant given by (4.9)</p><p>In the discrete case, the MAP estimation interpretation is based on the assumption that the image can be represented by the discrete approximation of a certain SPDE image model, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">Lf = E (4.10)</formula><p>where f is the image vector, L is a model dependent matrix, and E is a vector consisting of zero-mean white noise elements. Following a similar reasoning (see also [431),</p><p>it can be shown that the MAP estimate is the fMAP E R N 2</p><p>which minimizes the following quadratic form:</p><p>Md,[f, gl = IIAf -g112 + +f I12. In conclusion, given that the a priori knowledge about the image can be described by an SPDE image model, the MAP estimate of the object is the result of the minimization problem (4.8) or (4.11). This is exactly the minimization problem developed on the basis of the stabilizing functional approach, given that the stabilizing functional used belongs to the class of stabilizing functionals defined by (2.19). The MAP interpretation of the stabilizing functional approach can therefore be described as follows. Given that the stabilizing functional used is based on a certain PDO, the regularized solution obtained is the MAP estimate of the object assuming that the a priori knowledge for the image can be described by the corresponding SPDE image model. Conversely, given that an image can be represented by a certain SPDE model, the MAP estimate of the object is the result of the minimization problem (4.8) or (4.11).</p><p>According to this analysis, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the image representation by an SPDE model assumed and the stabilizing functional to be chosen in the minimization problem. In other words, the problem of selecting the "optimum" stabilizing functional for a given application is equivalent with the problem of determining the "optimum" SPDE representation image restoration. In fact, any constraint operator proposed can be related to the description of the a priori knowledge existing for the image by the discrete approximation of a certain SPDE image model. In this paper, a number of models proposed in <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref> to represent images are considered to be the source of constraint operators.</p></div>

REGULARIZING FILTERS</head><p>This section presents the derivation of a variety of filters resulting from the application of RT in continuous image restoration. In general, the image formation process is described by the space-variant model (1.2). To simplify the solution of the integro-differential equation (3.4), it is now assumed that the image formation process can be described by a space-invariant model. Fortunately, this assumption is realistic in many image restoration applications. The physical meaning of such an assumption is that the image formation process has a uniform effect on both the object and the image plane. The direct analytical implication of the above assumption is that the PSF is a function of the differences between the variables belonging to the image and the object plane. In the case of space-invariant formulation, the image formation process is described by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">S S h ( U -x , U -y ) f ( x , Y ) d x d Y + n ( u , v ) = g ( u , U).</formula><p>(5.1)</p><p>In this case, the image formation is described by 2-D convolution. Therefore, image restoration corresponds to deconvolution, well known as ill-posed inverse problem in the literature.</p><p>Suppose that a nonnegative quadratic functional of the form (2.10) is used as a stabilizing functional. The necessary and sufficient condition for the minimization of the corresponding smoothing functional is obtained from (3.4) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">= z ( x , Y ) ( 5 . 2 ) where % Y ) = j j jl(E -x , I -Y ) h ( E , l-) dE &amp; (5.3) g(x, Y ) = s j h(E -x, l--Y ) g ( t &gt; I) 4 dl-(5.4)</formula><p>and B ( -) is the PDO defined by (2.13).</p><p>It is proven in Appendix D that the solution of the integro-differential equation of the form (5.2) can be obtained by passing the data through a filter, called regulurizing jilter (RF).

On the other hand, the above interpretation provides a link between MAP estimation and constrained least squares in where R ( * ) is a polynomial, called regularizing polynomial, defined uniquely in terms of the quadratic functional considered by R(w1, w2) = B ( j W l , j % ) .</p><p>(5.6)</p><p>The parameter a , which is the Lagrange multiplier in the minimization problem formulated, is called regularizing parameter.

(5.10)   The nonnegative definition of all the regularizing polynomials obtained is closely related to the nonnegativeness of the quadratic stabilizing functionals and, therefore, to the existence of a minimum for this class of functionals considered. The transfer function given by (5.5) depends on the specific PDO chosen. In this sense, (5.5) determines a very broad class of regularizing filters. Since the relation between the PDO B ( * ) and the regularizing polynomial R ( * ) is unique, there is one-to-one correspondence between any quadratic stabilizing functional chosen, and the RF obtained <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The RF defined by (5.5) can also be written as follows:</p><p>where Clearly, the effect of regularization is carried by the function P ( * ) , defined by (5.12).

Regularized Solutions Based on Noncausal SPDE Image Models</head><p>Many of the early image restoration approaches based on constrained optimization were motivated by the use of cubic splines in 2-D problems <ref type="bibr">[ 13, [2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. The resulting algorithms were based on two 1-D cubic splines, each one corresponding to the horizontal and vertical directions. The relationship between cubic splines and the minimization of a quadratic functional is now investigated. It is well known that the 1-D cubic splines result from the minimization of the following functional of one variable:</p><p>The direct generalization of the functional ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_51">6</ref>.1) amounts to the following functional of two variables:</p><p>(5.15)</p><p>The filters defined by (5.15) are called generalized regularizing jlters (GRF's).</p><p>The class of GRF's defined by ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>.15) consists of an infinite number of elements for a given combination of a and R ( ) and for all y E (0, 1 1. By definition, the value y = 0 is not an allowable one for the free parameter y. In such a case, (5.13) amounts to P ( o l , w 2 , a) = 1. Therefore, y = 0 is the limiting and, in fact, trivial case where there is no regularization applied on the derivation of the solution. Not surprisingly, in this case, the transfer function given by (5.15) amounts to the transfer function of the ill-behaved inverse filter. The case of y = 1 is also of special interest here. In this case, the class of GRF's defined by (5.15) amounts to ( 5 . 3 , which is exactly the class of RF's derived on the basis of the stabilizing functional approach. Under this consideration, the stabilizing functional approach can be seen as a special methodology in constructing RO's.</p><p>Among all values of y E (0, 1 ) , the specific value y = is of special interest. In this case, the transfer function given by (5.15) amounts to This is the functional chosen to be minimized in <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. Obviously, the functional defined by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_51">6</ref>.2) is a special case of the class of quadratic functionals defined by <ref type="bibr">(2.19</ref>), corresponding to a separable, elliptic PDO L ( . ) .</p><p>The interpretation traditionally associated with quadratic functionals is that they control the smoothness of the resulting image. However, on the basis of the analysis presented in Section IV, their interpretation can be more elaborate and selective. In fact, the use of a separable quadratic functional of the form (6.2) implies the representation of the image by a separable noncausal SPDE image model. This statement determines the limited efficiency of such functionals, given the limitation of separable SPDE image models in representing images. In fact, it has been shown <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref> that the nonseparable SPDE image models are more suitable in representing real world images. Several operators corresponding to noncausal models are presented here <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>.</p><p>The discrete approximation of any noncausal SPDE image model can be written in a matrix form as follows:</p><p>(5.16) If, in addition, H * ( w l , w2) = H ( w , , w 2 ) , which is the case in most of the image formation systems, then ]I-:. Among noncausal SPDE image models, the separable ones possess the simplest discrete approximation. In fact, in the case of separable noncausal SPDE models, L, consists of only one term. The discrete approximation of various noncausal SPDE image models is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">I11</ref> [45]. In this approximation, Z is the N x N identity matrix, and Q is a tridiagonal, symmetric, Toeplitz matrix whose elements are given by Let the original PSM A be denoted here as A,. Once again, the subscript "n" stands for noncausal. On the other hand, the operator L, is given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_51">6</ref>.5) and the image is represented by the vectorf, = f. In this case, the restored image is obtained as the solution of the following set of linear equations: The resulting image can be directly obtained by converting the vectorf, into a matrix form.</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">qo if i = j qc = -ql if Ii -j l = I (<label>6</label></formula></div>

Regularized Solutions Based on Semicausal SPDE Image Models</head><p>This section deals with the discrete image restoration based on the representation of the image by semicausal SPDE image models.

The new formulation of the problem is mainly dictated by the form of the discrete approximation of the semicausal SPDE image models. The discrete approximation corresponding to semicausal SPDE image models is examined here. L e t f , ; j = 1, 2 , . . . , N be the N X 1 vectors corresponding to the N columns of the image matrix (6.10)</p><p>According to [45], the discrete approximation of any semicausal SPDE image model can be expressed by the following set of matrix-vector equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">PIA -P , f , -, = E,; j = 2, 3, * , N<label>(6.11)</label></formula><p>where E,: j = 2, 3 , , N are N X 1 vectors consisting of zero-mean white noise elements and PI is the N X N symmetric, tridiagonal, Toeplitz matrix defined by (6.6). The difference between the discrete approximation of the two semicausal SPDE image models proposed in [45] lies on the form of the matrix P2. In the case of the nonseparable semicausal SPDE image model, known as semicausal 1 (SCl),</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">P2 = yz (6.12)</formula><p>where y is a model dependent coefficient and Z is the N x N identity matrix.

(<label>6.13)</label></formula><p>Given the above discrete approximation of the semicausal SPDE image models, one possibility is to develop a restoring algorithm estimating each pair of the image columns separately. Using such an approach, the correlation existing in one of the two directions, in fact the horizontal one, is lost. Therefore, even if the algorithm to be developed is optimum in some sense, the entire procedure will be suboptimum. The objective here, therefore, is to develop a restoring algorithm working on the whole image, instead of covering the image estimating the adjacent image columns in successive steps. Therefore, an alternative form of the discrete approximation of semicausal SPDE image models is required; this is now derived. Combining the N -1 equations given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_51">6</ref>.1 I), the discrete approximation of any semicausal SPDE image model can be equivalently written in the following form: L, j-, = 6,. <ref type="bibr">(6.14)</ref> In <ref type="bibr">(6.14)</ref>, the image is represented by a new N2 X 1 vector defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">Fn = fl f 2 . . .</formula><p>fs'= [fT fT . * . f i l <ref type="bibr">(6.15)</ref> wheref,;j = 1, 2, . . , N are the image columns.

Therefore, the model (1.3) describing the image formation process should be appropriately modified in such a way that the image be again represented in the model by the new vector f s . The image vector f,,, conventionally used to represent an image, consists of N subvectors which correspond to the ordered rows of the image matrix. On the other hand, the image vector fs consists of subvectors which correspond to the columns of the image matrix.

Discrete Image Restoration Algorithms</head><p>According to the discrete formulation of the image restoration problem, the restored image is the solution of the following set of linear equations: <ref type="bibr">(6.28)</ref> Serious computational problems arise, in practice, caused by the dimensionality of the resulting set of linear equations. In fact, AR is an N 2 X N 2 matrix while N = 256 or 512 is a common situation in many of the existing image display systems. Therefore, the direct solution of (6.28), either by evaluating the inverse of A , or by applying any direct method, is impossible for small or medium size computer systems, while impractical, if not impossible, even for large size computer systems. The specific problem of solving a set of linear equations is equivalent with the minimization of a certain quadratic form. A suitable class of iterative methods capable of performing this minimization is the class of gradient methods <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>, The tradeoff existing in choosing iterative algorithms is between the computing requirements, both arithmetic operations per iteration and storage space required, and the rate of convergence. The conjugate gradient algorithm is certainly the most demanding among the existing gradient algorithms, in terms of the computing requirements. However, its rate of convergence is satisfactory in the sense that it converges after a certain number of iterations.

However, the huge size of the matrix AR which needs to be stored makes the applicability of the algorithm in its present form doubtful. The assumption that the image formation process can be described by a separable PSM is particularly important with regard to the implementation of the algorithm. Fortunately, many kinds of distortion appearing in practical situations can be described by a separable PSM as, for instance, linear motion and atmospheric turbulence blur [ 11, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.

This algorithm is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">VI</ref> Another implicit assumption considered is that the second-order statistics of the object and the noise are known. However, the a priori knowledge required for the evaluation of the optimum estimate in the Wiener sense is very rarely available <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>The Aphrodite of Milos, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, was used as a test image in the set of experiments based on the regularizing filters proposed in Section V . The distorted image is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">2</ref>. The distortion used is the one corresponding to horizontal linear motion blur, as modeled in [l]. In addition to blur, the image was contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. The SNR determined with respect to the undegraded image is 25 dB. The restored images reported here were obtained by filtering the distorted image using the GRF whose transfer function is given by (5.17). Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">4</ref> show the restored images which correspond to the regularizing polynomials based on the NC 1 and SC 1 image models, respectively. Several experiments indicated that the use of different regularizing polynomials causes a significant variation to the quality of the resulting image estimates. The regularizing polynomials corresponding to SCl (semicausal 1) and NC1 (Poisson) image models result in very good and visually pleasing restored images. The regularizing polynomial corresponding to NC2 (biharmonic) image model results in a restored image whose visual quality is slightly inferior. Finally, several experiments showed that the regularizing polynomials corresponding to C 1, SC2, and NC3 image models result in restored images of relatively poor visual quality. The filters proposed are sensitive to the level of the noise in the distorted image. It has been estimated that these filters result in visually satisfactory images only for SNR greater than 20 dB. In terms of the computational  The GRF's corresponding to y = provide the best results among all the regularizing filters proposed in Section V. A remarkable case is the experimental performance evaluation of the class of regularizing filters defined by (5.5). Despite the optimal derivation of this class of filters, their performance is not satisfactory. In fact, the restored image obtained using this class of filters was not found to be pleasing to the human eye, although the blur and noise are reduced substantially. This is not surprising, taking into account the optimality of this class of filters in the Wiener sense presented in Section VII. It has been pointed out very early that the performance of Wiener filtering, when performed in the frequency domain, suffers in terms of the resulting visual quality [ l].</p><p>-. The experiments indicated that the discrete algorithms based on nonseparable SPDE image models result in better restored images than the ones based on separable models. The superiority of the nonseparable SPDE image models over the separable ones becomes obvious in situations of severe degradation and/or noise. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref> show the best restored images, obtained by employing the discrete algorithms corresponding to the NCI and SC1 image models, respectively.</p><p>In these experiments, the iterative algorithms were initialized bv using an identicallv zero matrix as the initial tion blur and additive Gaussian noise.   requirements, these filters are very fast due to the existence of very fast algorithms performing 2-D discrete Fourier transform. For example, the time required for the restoration of a 256 x 256 image in the Vax Ill780 computer system was approximately 3 minutes CPU time. The time required for restoration, in addition to the simple realization of such filters, make them ideal for use in small and medium size computer systems. In fact, there exists some improvement of the restored image after 50 iterations, in particular, the enhancement of some fine details of the image. However, the improve-   ment is not as substantial as to be considered worth the computer time required. Another alternative examined during the experimental work was to make the algorithms independent from a predecided number of iterations. In such a case, the algorithm may stop by itself using as a criterion that the error measurement provided by the con-jugate algorithm be smaller than a given threshold. However, the main difficulty arising is the lack of an obvious correspondence between any threshold chosen and the visual quality of the image. Discrete image restoration is by its nature computationally very demanding, due to the huge amount of data involved in the image formation process. In fact, the implementation of any discrete algorithm for image restoration involves several multiplications of very largesize matrices. On the other hand, the conjugate gradient algorithm, by itself, requires an excessive amount of storage space for its implementation. Fortunately, all matrices involved in the discrete approximation of SPDE image models are sparse matrices possessing a standard form. Therefore, with some additional programming effort, a lot of arithmetic operation can be avoided by ignoring all multiplications including zeros. On the other hand, due to the implementation of the algorithms in a matrix form, the largest matrix to be stored is of size N X N .</p><p>According to the experiments, the regularizing parameter a controls the tradeoff between noise reduction and the restoration of the fine details of the image. The value of a is mainly affected from the level of noise in the degraded image. The higher the level of noise in the degraded image is, the larger the parameter QI will be. On the other hand, the larger the parameter a is, the higher the degree of smoothness in the restored image will be. Therefore, the choice of a may be based on a subjective quality criterion.</p><p>According to the experimental results, any stabilizing functional used amounts to stable image estimates. However, the visual quality of the results is not guaranteed by the use of any stabilizing functional. This supports the argument that regularization theory, although guaranteeing the stability of the image estimates, cannot be used alone to solve the image restoration problem. In other words, this is an experimental verification of the importance of the MAP estimation interpretation and the use of SPDE image models proposed in this paper. Finally, this set of experimental results can also be used for the qual-itative evaluation of various SPDE image models in representing images. In fact, the resulting evaluation exhibits full agreement with the one presented in [ 4 5 ] . As follows from the experiments, the SC1 and NC1 image models provide the best image representation. Some additional comments are as follows:</p><p>1) Image representation using a causal SPDE image model is not realistic. This is not surprising since, using such a representation, each pixel is correlated with only the "past" pixels in both directions, although every pixel is correlated with all its neighbors.</p><p>2) Semicausal and noncausal SPDE image models provide the most realistic image representation.</p><p>3) Nonseparable SPDE image models are the most appropriate for image representation. A direct implication of this is that the best stabilizing functionals correspond to nonseparable PDO's as well. IX. CONCLUSIONS This paper examined several aspects of regularization theory in image restoration; this was accomplished by extending the applicability of the stabilizing functional approach to 2-D inverse problems. It was shown that the stabilizing functional approach can be the basis for the derivation of a large variety of regularized solutions in image restoration, depending on the form of the stabilizing functional chosen. A systematic study regarding the choice of stabilizing functionals was also presented, with particular emphasis on a certain class of quadratic functionals. The particular class of quadratic functionals whose minimization amounts to 2-D L-generalized splines was finally considered the source of stabilizing functionals. This particular class of quadratic functionals was also interpreted as a link between the family of constrained least squares and the stabilizing functional approach. The choice of a particular quadratic stabilizing functional was related to the a priori information regarding the expected regularized solution. More specifically, the MAP estimation interpretation of the proposed formulation indicated that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between any quadratic functional used and a certain SPDE image model representation. This MAP estimation formulation also provides the basis for a stochastic interpretation of the entire family of constrained least squares approaches. The optimality of the resulting regularized solutions in the Wiener sense was finally discussed. The importance of the work presented in this paper is that several mathematical concepts and statistical approaches, which appeared independently toward the solution of the image restoration problem, converged to the derivation of a variety of analytically optimum regularized solutions that can be related to the stochastic nature of the image restoration problem.</p><p>Proof of Proposition 3: Assume that A,, is a separable matrix, that is, it can be written as follows:</p><p>A, = C 0 D.

The necessary and sufficient condition thatf = f ,* E R N 2 minimizes the quadratic form (3.27) is that f , * satisfies the following set of linear equations: In the particular case that the stabilizing functional considered belongs to the class of quadratic functionals defined by (2.19), the quadratic form to be minimized is the following: where M d , [ f , 81 = llAf -gl12 + .IIILf I12.

The physical meaning of choosing a specific functional to be minimized, or equivalently an operator L in (3.30), is investigated in the sequel.</figDesc></figure>

The distorted image is shown in Fig. 6. The distortion appearing is a horizontal linear motion blur, as modeled in [7]. The image was also contaminated by additive Gaussian noise.The experiments indicated that the discrete algorithms based on nonseparable SPDE image models result in better restored images than the ones based on separable models. The superiority of the nonseparable SPDE image models over the separable ones becomes obvious in situations of severe degradation and/or noise. Figs.7 and 8show the best restored images, obtained by employing the discrete algorithms corresponding to the NCI and SC1 image models, respectively.In these experiments, the iterative algorithms were initialized bv using an identicallv zero matrix as the initial</figDesc></figure>
