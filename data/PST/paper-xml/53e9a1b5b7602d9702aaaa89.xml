<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maximum Channel Throughput via Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks</head><p>Junyang Shen, Tao Jiang, Siyang Liu, and Zhongshan Zhang Abstract-In cognitive radio networks, the secondary (unlicensed) users need to find idle channels via spectrum sensing for their transmission. Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is a promising technology in spectrum sensing with an admirable performance. In CSS, multiple secondary users individually sense the idle channels and send their decisions to the network center, and then the center will do a final decision. In this paper, we focus on the optimal sensing settings of the CSS to maximize the channel throughput under some constraints on the interference to cognitive radio network. Particularly, we consider two scenarios in this paper. In the first scenario, only one channel is sensed at one time, and we aim at maximizing an individual channel capacity. Some simple algorithms are also derived to calculate the optimal solution for the first scenario. In the second scenario, multiple channels are jointly sensed simultaneously, and our objective is to maximize the overall channel capacity. We prove that the optimization problem in the second scenario can be converted into a convex-optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently and reliably. Simulation results show a significant improvement of the channel capacity by using the proposed optimal CSS in cognitive radio networks. Index Terms-Cooperative spectrum sensing, cognitive radio networks, convex optimization, throughput.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R ADIO spectrum is usually considered as a scare resource while measurements show that the allocated spectrums are vastly under-utilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The cognitive radio (CR), which has received a considerable attention, is designed for the secondary users to opportunistically access to the unused primary (licensed) spectrums without causing interference to the primary users <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) to allow the unlicensed CR devices to operate in the unused broadcast channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and the IEEE 802. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Working Group is now building a CR-based air interface over the Broadcast bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Both of these activities dramatically improve the spectral efficiency of the existing communication networks.</p><p>In CR, the secondary users need to opportunistically sense the idle channels. Once an idle channel is sensed, the secondary system will access this channel. Therefore, spectrum sensing, as a fundamental problem in CR, requests the secondary users to efficiently and effectively detect the presence of the primary signals. However, low signal-to-noise radio (SNR) and detrimental effects of fading/shadowing, which result in no knowledge of the primary signals in the secondary users, make the spectrum sensing problem more involved in CR. As a result, there is an increasing interest in using multiple sensors in spectrum sensing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Related Work</head><p>Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) has been studied extensively as a promising alternative to improve the sensing performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In CSS, local sensors individually sense the channels and then send information to the network center, and the network center will make the final decision. There are mainly four kinds of CSS: 1) The counting rule, which includes AND-rule-based CSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, OR-rule-based CSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and MAJORITY rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> as special cases. In the AND rule, the primary channel is sensed to be occupied only when all the secondary users claim so, while in the OR rule, the primary channel is sensed to be occupied when there is one or more than one secondary users claim so. The MAJORITY rule denotes the one under which the primary channel is sensed to be occupied when more than half of the secondary users claim so. Therefore, the AND, OR and MAJORITY rules are three particular cases of counting rule that multiple secondary users send only their own decisions to the network center, where the final decision will be made based on the number of second users that vote for the presence of the primary signal; 2) To make mathematical analysis more tractable, the optimal methods based on a linear combination of local sensing measurements are proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>; 3) In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a liner-quadratic (LQ) strategy is proposed to combat the correlation between secondary users; 4) By exploiting the spatial diversity inherent in multiuser networks, relay-based CSS are analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the local sensing strategy, three sensing methods are proposed, i.e., energy detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, matched filtering (coherent) detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and cyclostationary feature detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. If the characteristics of the primary signals are unavailable to the secondary users, the energy detection is a natural candidate, because only the signal power can be sensed. When the cognitive radios have some knowledge about the primary signal characteristics such as preambles, pilots, and synchronization symbols, the matched filter detection can achieve the best performance. If the modulation schemes of the primary signals are known, the cyclostationary feature detector can differentiate the primary signals from the local noise by exploiting a certain periodicity, and the cyclostationary feature can be exhibited in the mean and autocorrelation of the corresponding modulated signals.</p><p>Another issue related to the sensing in cognitive radio networks is the sensing objective. There are two quantities that related to the sensing performance. One is the probability of detection, which is the probability of the presence of the primary user being detected. Another is the probability of false alarm, which is the probability that the primary user is detected as presence, but actually it is absent. Most of CSS researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> are under the Neyman-Pearson criterion to maximize the probability of detection while giving a constraint on probability of the false alarm. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the sensing goal is to maximize the aggregated throughput of the secondary system, giving the constraints on the interference of the second users to the primary system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contributions</head><p>In this paper, we employ the counting rule as the fusion rule at the network center since the counting rule needs only to send the decisions of local secondary users to the center. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we assume that the energy detection is employed as the local sensing. Our object is to find the optimal sensing settings to maximize the channel throughput under the constraints on the interference of the secondary users to the CR system. The main contributions are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) We take a further step on studying the counting-rulebased CSS. Compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the counting rule needs less data transmissions between the secondary users and the center, just because only the decisions are needed to be sent. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the counting rule announces a superior performance to the LQ detector in a weak-correlation case, which corresponds to many practical situations. For example, the correlation coefficient between two secondary users of 60𝑚 apart is only approximately 0.003 in an urban environment. In Relay based CSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the secondary users near the primary transmitters relay the primary signals for the secondary users far from primary transmitters. However, the size of the cognitive radio network is always small compared with its distance from the primary system. Then, the secondary users are approximately within the same range from primary transmitters and the relay is unnecessary. Besides, experimental studies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> show admirable sensing performance of counting-rule-based CSS. In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we do not specify the threshold at the center but consider only the general counting rule, including the AND, OR and MAJORITY rules as two special cases. Therefore, our proposed scheme can potentially offer a better performance than that of AND, OR and MAJORITY rules.</p><p>2) Motivated by the study on multiple channel sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, we extend the counting rule to the wide-band sensing case, where multiple channels are jointly sensed simultaneously. Since the channel switching time ranges from 100𝜇𝑠 to 200𝜇𝑠 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) structure, the wide-band sensing does not need time for the channel switching since multiple channels can be sensed simultaneously. Moreover, as one of the merit of time efficiency, the wide-band sensing potentially enables the system level optimization by jointly considering the status of multiple channels.</p><p>3) The sensing objective in our study is to maximize the channel throughput, either in the single-channel-sensing case or in the wide-band-sensing case. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the sensing is performed under the Neyman-Pearson criterion, and corresponding objective is to maximize the probability of detection under a constraint on the false-alarm probability. Since CR is originally designed to improve the spectrum efficiency, maximizing the channel throughput is one of more practical interest. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the sensing objective is to maximize the secondary system throughput. However, our study focuses on maximizing the sum of the primary and secondary throughput. Obviously, as shown in section IV, our sensing objective is a more general case, and it contains the sensing objective in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> as some particular cases.</p><p>4) We consider both the single-channel-sensing and wideband-sensing cases. Due to QoS constraints and some other reasons, only one channel is sensed at one time even if the primary system consists of multiple channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In such a scenario, we derive the optimal sensing settings by exploiting the inherent properties of the optimization problem. In addition, simple methods are also introduced to calculate the optimal parameters. The second scenario is the wideband sensing, where multiple channels need to be sensed simultaneously. In this case, the optimization problem can be formulated as a convex-optimization. The convexity of this problem guarantees that the local optimum is also the global one. Moreover, converting the sensing problem into a convex optimization has the basic advantage, since a convex problem can then be solved reliably and efficiently by using the interior-point methods or other special methods for convex optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Energy detection is analyzed in Section II. The counting rule is introduced in Section III. Optimal settings for single channel sensing are analyzed in detail in Section IV. Optimal settings for wide-band sensing is discussed in Section V. Simulation results are presented in Section VI. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII.</p></div>

ENERGY DETECTION</head><p>Considering 𝑀 sparsely dispersed secondary users in a secondary network and its size is small as compared to the distance between the secondary network and the primary network. In addition, we assume that the primary signals received at secondary users are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. Without loss of generality, we assume that the noise power are identical at different secondary users, and the same decision rules are employed among secondary users, which is the same as that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Let H 0 and H 1 denote the absence and the presence of the primary user, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. COUNTING RULE BASED SPECTRUM SENSING</head><p>In this section, we present the system architecture of the counting rule, compare it with other existing sensing schemes and study the impact of network parameters in sensing.</p><p>For the counting rule, network center makes the final decision based on the number of secondary users claiming the existence of primary users. Let Λ be the number of this kind of claiming secondary users. The decision strategy for CSS that uses the counting rule can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">{ if Λ &gt; 𝐾, decide H 1 if Λ ≤ 𝐾, decide H 0<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where 𝐾=0, 1, . . . , 𝑀 -1 is the decision threshold at the network center. The choose of 𝐾 is optional. For the "AND" rule, 𝐾 = 0; for "OR" rule, 𝐾 = 𝑀 -1. In the literature, obtaining the optimal 𝐾 is still an unsolved problem, especially when the fading is considered. In this paper, we generally assume 𝐾 may be any one of 0, 1, . . . , 𝑀-1. The final false-alarm probability (𝑄 𝑓 ) and the final detection probability (𝑄 𝑑 ) at the center are evaluated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">𝑄 𝑓 = 𝑀 ∑ 𝑖=𝐾+1 𝐵(𝑖; 𝑀, 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ),<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝑄 𝑑 = 𝑀 ∑ 𝑖=𝐾+1 𝐵(𝑖; 𝑀, 𝑃 ′ 𝑑 ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where 𝐵(𝑘; 𝑛, 𝑝)= ( 𝑛 𝑘 ) 𝑝 𝑘 (1 -𝑝) 𝑛-𝑘 is the probability that in successive 𝑘 n-Bernoulli trials, there are 𝑝 success results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Comparison between Counting Rule and Related Sensing Schemes</head><p>In this subsection, we extensively compare the counting rule with related sensing methods, i.e., AND <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, OR <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, MAJORITY, weighted sum <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and linear combination rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We show that the counting rule is more reasonable and has better sensing performance than these related sensing methods in practical situation. Because the LQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and relay based <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> - <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> cooperative spectrum sensing have totally different system architecture with the counting rule, we do not consider the comparisons between them.</p><p>Firstly, we consider the relation between AND, OR, MA-JORITY and counting rules. The comparisons between them are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, where 𝑀 and 𝐾 are defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. It can be easily observed that AND, OR, MAJORITY are special cases of the counting rule, and the optimization methods proposed in this paper can also be applied for these methods.</p><p>Secondly, we consider the counting rule instead of weighted sum for following reason. Practical cognitive radio networks are always far way from the primary transmitters <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, thus, it is reasonable to assume each secondary user suffers i.i.d. primary signals, and give every secondary the equal weight factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. For such reason, we focus on the counting rule in this paper.</p><p>Finally, we compare the counting rule with the linear combination rule. The linear combination rule requires the secondary users to send the measurements to the center while counting rule only sends the decision. In practice, the bandwidth between the secondary users and the center is limited. Assume each secondary user sends 𝑏 bit to the center and the maximum throughput between the secondary users and the center is 𝑊 bit, then the number of secondary users which can send their sensing information to the center is 𝑈 = 𝑊/𝑏 . Thus, if more information is sent by each secondary user, less secondary users can be involved in the sensing system. For the counting rule, 𝑏 = 1, while in the linear combination rule, 𝑏 should always be very large, or even infinite (if the measurements are perfectly sent to the center without error). Here, we consider a more general question: which pair of 𝑏 and 𝑈 will achieve the best sensing performance given 𝑊 ? Previous studies in the field of sensor network has shown that "the optimal fusion rule has a structure that generalized the majority rule for binary sensors" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The "generalized majority rule" corresponds counting rule, and "binary sensors" means 𝑏 = 1. Thus, with limited bandwidth between secondary users and the center, the counting rule has better sensing performance than the linear combination rule, and will hence achieves higher system capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Network Issues of Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio</head><p>In this subsection, we consider the network issues in spectrum sensing, including the number of secondary user, detection delay and signal interference.</p><p>Firstly, we consider the impact of number of secondary users in spectrum sensing. Existing researches have demonstrated that more secondary users in cooperative spectrum sensing has high chance to find the idle spectrum bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In cognitive radio, the sensed idle bands will be allocated to secondary users via certain strategy. Since higher chance to find the idle channels means high secondary system throughput, more secondary users will enhance the throughput of secondary system.</p><p>Secondly, we analyze the detection delay. If a primary channel becomes occupied in a spectrum channel during the interval of two sensing, the secondary signals in this channel will bring interference to primary system until this channel is found to occupied in the next sensing. For such reason, the secondary users need to periodically sense the channels to refresh the sensing results within given time span (the maximum time span between two sensing is 6 seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) to avoid interference to primary systems. Existing results have shown that with the same sensing performance, more secondary users involved leads to less sensing time/delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Therefore, the cooperative spectrum sensing will decrease the sensing delay, and subsequently reduce the interference to the primary system.</p><p>Thirdly, we consider the signal interference in spectrum sensing. In spectrum sensing, the interference and the transmitted signal of a primary user are both considered as the primary signals. For example, if primary user A and primary user B transmitted signals with power 𝜒1 and 𝜒2, respectively. The signal of primary user B is considered as interference to primary A. However, the secondary system regards the primary signal power in this band as 𝜒1 + 𝜒2. This is because the energy detection only relies on the signal power and cannot distinguish different primary signal characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. OPTIMAL SETTINGS FOR SINGLE CHANNEL SENSING</head><p>In CR, secondary users access to the primary channel only when the channel is sensed to be idle. Let 𝛿 denote the probability that the channel is occupied and 1 -𝛿 denote the probability that the channel is idle. Therefore, the probability that the channel occupied by only the primary users is 𝑄 𝑑 𝛿, and the probability that the channel occupied simultaneously by both primary users and secondary users is 𝛿(1 -𝑄 𝑑 ), and the probability that the channel is occupied only by the secondary users is (1 -𝑄 𝑓 )(1 -𝛿). Let 𝑇 𝑝 and 𝑇 ′ 𝑝 denote the throughput of the primary system without and with the existence of the secondary user, respectively.

OPTIMAL SETTINGS FOR WIDE-BAND SENSING</head><p>Generally, there are multiple channels need to be sensed simultaneously as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. The sensing system may use FFT operation to perform the wide-band sensing to sense multiple channels jointly as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. We assume that 𝐿 channels are jointly sensed.

Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> is convex and it takes the form of minimizing a convex function subject to some convex constraints, a local optimum of (27) is also the global optimum. Moreover, some existing algorithms like interior-point method can be employed to solve this type of convex problem.

However, using the Newton-Raphson method is preferred only because of its faster convergence rate. The Newton-Raphson method has mathematically been proven its quadratic convergence rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, while the convergence rates of algorithms for convex problems like the steepest descent, gradient descent and Newton methods are usually slower than the quadratic rate. The convergence rate of both the Steepest descent method and the Gradient descent method is linear, but the Newton's method may achieve a quadratic convergence rate if the derivative of the objective function satisfies some certain conditions [26, Eqn. 9.33]; otherwise, only a linear convergence rate can be obtained.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Single channel sensing</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> illustrates some results of channel throughput 𝐽 versus 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 with different 𝐾 under different channels, i.e., AWGN, Rayleigh and Nakagami-𝑚 (𝑚 = 3) fading channels, in which sensing parameters are given as 𝑆𝑁 𝑅 = 8𝑑𝐵 (average SNR ), 𝑁 = 10 and 𝑀 = 4, and the system parameters are given as 𝑎 0 = 12, 𝑎 1 = 7 and 𝑎 2 = 9. It is obvious to find that under various channels, for a given 𝐾, there exists a particular value 𝑃 𝑓 , which falls in the region that before the area 𝑃 𝑓 , 𝐽 increases as 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 increases but after the area 𝑃 𝑓 , 𝐽 decreases as 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 increases. Therefore, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> also shown the validity of Theorem 2. Moreover, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> shows the optimal sensing settings can have much favorable performance (more than 50% improvement) over non-optimal settings. In addition, it can also be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> that the "ANR" rule (𝐾 = 3) and "OR" rule (𝐾 = 0) are not always optimal, e.g., 𝐾 = 1 is optimal for the AWGN and Nakagami-𝑚 fading channels. Note that the severity of the fading is indicated by the Nakagami parameter 𝑚 and the severity decreases as 𝑚 increases, e.g., 𝑚 = 1 is for Rayleigh fading and 𝑚 = ∞ is for an AWGN channel. Another phenomenon that deserves noticing is that sensing performance with smaller 𝐾 is more robust to detrimental effects of channel fading. In other words, there are bigger differences between 𝐽 in an AWGN channel and 𝐽 in fading channels for larger 𝐾.</p></div>

According to Lemma 2, the second and third items of (37) are also negative. Therefore, 𝑑𝜋 2 /𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑓 &lt; 0 and 𝜋 2 is a decreasing function of 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 . Therefore, 𝜋 2 (𝑏) &gt; 𝜋 2 (𝑑) since 𝑏 &lt; 𝑑. Proof: It is easy to find that According to (41), since the above inequality holds for ∀𝛾, we have lim 𝑃 ′ Combining with (40), we have lim 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 →0 𝜋 2 (𝑃 ′ 𝑓 )→+∞. Therefore, when 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 is small, 𝑑𝐽/𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑓 &gt; 0 is satisfied, and 𝐽 is proven as an increasing function of 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 . According to lemma 3, when lim 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 →1 𝜋 2 (𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ) ≥ 1, we have 𝜋 2 (𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ) ≥ 1 for 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ∈ [0, 1], and then 𝐽 is an increasing function of 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 in the range 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ∈[0, 1] according to (19). If lim 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 →1 𝜋 2 (𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ) &lt; 1, the root of 𝜋(𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ) -1 = 0 falls in the range 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ∈ [0, 1]. We define 𝑃 𝑓 as the root of 𝜋(𝑃 ′ 𝑓 )-1 = 0, and hence 𝐽 is proven as an increasing function in [0, 𝑃 𝑓 ) and a decreasing function in (𝑃 𝑓 , 1]. If 𝜋 2 (𝑏) &gt; 𝜋 2 (𝑑) ≥ 1, 𝐽(𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ) is an increasing function in the range 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ∈ [𝑏, 𝑑]. Therefore, the maximum point is achieved at 𝑑. If 1 ≥ 𝜋 2 (𝑏) &gt; 𝜋 2 (𝑑), 𝐽(𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ) is a decreasing function in the range 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ∈[𝑏, 𝑑]. Therefore, the maximum point is achieved at 𝑏. If 𝜋 2 (𝑏) &gt; 1 &gt; 𝜋 2 (𝑑), 𝐽 is an increasing function in 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ∈ [𝑏, 𝑃 𝑓 ) and is a decreasing function in 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ∈ (𝑃 𝑓 , 𝑑], and the maximum 𝐽 is achieved at 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 = 𝑃 𝑓 . Proof: For brevity, let 𝜙 denote 𝑃 𝑗 𝑓 and 𝜓 denote 𝑃 𝑗 𝑑 , respectively. According to (15) and (16), we have 𝑑 2 𝜓 𝑑𝜙 2 &lt; 0 since 𝑑𝜙 𝑑𝜓 &gt; 0. Therefore, the first item of (45) is negative. According to Lemma 1, the second and third items of (45) are also negative, respectively.

Theorem 1 is hence proven. we have PROOF OF LEMMA 3 Proof: It is obvious to get 𝜋 2 (𝑃 ′ 𝑓 as 𝑑𝜋 2 𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑓 = 𝜋 2 × 𝜔 (36) with 𝜔 = 𝑑 2 𝑃 ′ 𝑑 𝑑𝑃 ′2 𝑓 𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑓 𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑑 + 𝐾( 1 𝑃 𝑑 𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑑 𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑓 -1 𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ) (37) -(𝑀 -𝐾 -1) ( 1 1 -𝑃 ′ 𝑑 𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑑 𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑓 -1 1 -𝑃 ′ 𝑓 ) . (38) According to Theorem 1, 𝑑 2 𝑃 ′ 𝑑 𝑑𝑃 ′2 𝑓 &lt; 0 since 𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑓 𝑑𝑃 ′ 𝑑 &gt; 0. APPENDIX D PROOF OF THEOREM 2 𝑑 2 𝑄 𝑗 𝑑 𝑑(𝑄 𝑗 𝑓 ) 2 = 𝑑𝜇 𝑑𝑄 𝑗 𝑓 = 𝑑𝜇/𝑑𝜙 𝑑𝑄 𝑗 𝑓 /𝑑𝜙 .
