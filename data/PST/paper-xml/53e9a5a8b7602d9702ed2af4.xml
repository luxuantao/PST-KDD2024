<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A Unified Framework for Design and Analysis of Networked and Quantized Control Systems Dragan Nešic ´, Fellow, IEEE, and Daniel Liberzon, Senior Member, IEEE Abstract-We generalize and unify a range of recent results in quantized control systems (QCS) and networked control systems (NCS) literature and provide a unified framework for controller design for control systems with quantization and time scheduling via an emulation-like approach. A crucial step in our proofs is finding an appropriate Lyapunov function for the quantization/ time-scheduling protocol which verifies its uniform global exponential stability (UGES). We construct Lyapunov functions for several representative protocols that are commonly found in the literature, as well as some new protocols not considered previously. Our approach is flexible and amenable to further extensions which are briefly discussed.</p><p>Index Terms-Networked control systems (NCS), quantized control systems (QCS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>C ONTROL of systems over band-limited channels is cur- rently attracting a lot of attention in the control community due to a range of emerging control applications. In such systems, certain control loops contain channels in which only a finite amount of data can be transferred at any transmission instant, and this leads to communication constraints that cannot be ignored in the controller design. Currently, there are two main approaches to modelling band-limited communication channels in control loops: i) the channel is digital and due to the finite word length effects only a finite number of bits can be transmitted over the channel at any transmission instant. The main issue in control (stabilization) of systems with such channels is that of quantization and we use the term quantized control systems (QCS) to denote systems exhibiting this feature (see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and references cited therein); ii) the channel is a serial bus and only a subset of sensors and/or actuators can transmit their data over the channel at each transmission instant. In this case, the sensor/actuator data is transmitted in packets and typically the quantization effects are ignored in the analysis (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and references therein). The main issue in this class of systems is time scheduling of transmissions of various signals in the system and these systems are often referred to in the literature as networked control systems (NCS).</p><p>These two modelling approaches evolved separately in the literature with little cross-referencing or cross-fertilization. However, a very similar controller design approach has been proposed for both QCS and NCS and this approach consists of the following steps: i) ignore the communication constraints of the channels (quantization or time scheduling) and design a controller using the classical techniques; ii) design/choose a particular quantizer or partition of the sensor/actuator vector, as well as an algorithm (protocol) that governs the quantization or time-scheduling during the operation of the system; iii) determine a sufficiently small upper bound on the inter-transmission intervals, the so-called maximal allowable transmission interval (MATI), that guarantees the stability of the system. For instance, this controller design approach was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for NCS and it was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for QCS. We note that this approach is a natural generalization of the emulation approach to controller design for sampled-data systems, see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>We mention that, while there have been no systematic attempts to unify formulations and techniques from the NCS and QCS literature, some specific designs combining quantization and time scheduling have been proposed, for instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We believe that this fact confirms the need for developing a general framework encompassing a large class of such protocols, which is the goal of this work. In the sequel, we refer to systems that combine time scheduling with quantization as networked and quantized control systems (NQCS).</p><p>The main purpose of this paper is to unify the controller design approaches mentioned above for QCS and NCS which naturally leads to the following contributions: i) We provide a unified framework for the emulation design approach which covers general NQCS and which is flexible, general and amenable to further extensions and modifications; ii) Our unified controller emulation framework brings two seemingly unrelated areas (QCS and NCS) under one umbrella and facilitates a cross-fertilization between them. For instance, we show that the notion of uniformly globally exponentially stable (UGES) protocols that was introduced in the NCS literature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>) has a natural interpretation in QCS. We believe that this is the first time in the literature that this connection is made. Moreover, the small-gain theorems used in stability proofs of NCS in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> provide new insights for QCS considered, for instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; iii) We show that many existing protocols (for NCS or QCS) as well as new protocols (for NQCS) are UGES in the sense of our definition, and we provide constructions of Lyapunov functions for these protocols in Section IV. On one hand, this analysis provides a completely new view of "box" and "zoom" protocols found in the quantization literature. On the other hand, this leads to an analysis of genuinely new protocols for NQCS that combine quantization and time scheduling, such as the TOD with "box" protocols considered in Section IV-C. (iv) An outcome of our unified approach is a range of emulation-type results stated in Section V which provide analytic bounds on the MATI that guarantee stability of various classes of NCS, QCS and NQCS with various protocols. We note that these bounds are essential in applying the emulation procedure and they provide an insight into how the controller and the protocol affect the stability of the overall closed-loop system.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section II contains the mathematical preliminaries and background results that are adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In Section III we illustrate that models of a range of NCS and QCS that arise in the literature, as well as NQCS not considered previously, are special cases of a particular class of systems with jumps to which our main results apply. We do not attempt to be exhaustive in this section and there may be other classes of systems that fit our framework. We show that the jump equation in this model depends solely on the network protocol. In Section IV, which contains our main technical contributions, we show that numerous protocols found in NCS, QCS and some new protocols for NQCS that we introduce are Lyapunov UGES in the sense defined in Section II. In Section V we combine the results from preceding sections to state explicit bounds on MATI that guarantee stability of the closed loop with emulated controllers in various situations. Some possible generalizations and conclusions are presented in the last section. Several auxiliary results are stated and proved in Appendix.</p></div>

Given and a piecewise continuous function , we use the notation . The Euclidean norm on is denoted by ; sometimes we will also use the infinity norm on .

To shorten notation, we often use . We write for the (block-)diagonal matrix with the indicated elements on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. For the systems we consider in this paper, a monotonically increasing sequence of times is given where and . Moreover, we assume that there exist and such that 1</p><p>(1) 1 The bound " t 0 t guarantees that the system does not exhibit Zeno solutions. This assumption can be relaxed by requiring that the sequence t be strictly increasing and lim t = 1.</p><p>We set the stage by outlining the emulation approach and recalling a result that follows from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The emulation approach was pioneered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for NCS without disturbances and further developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for systems with disturbances. The same approach was pursued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and elsewhere for QCS. Here we propose to apply this approach to NQCS. The first step in the emulation approach is to design a controller for a given plant ignoring the network (i.e., quantization and/or time scheduling). Namely, given a plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> one first designs a "nominal" controller (3) However, in the presence of time scheduling and/or quantization, the state is not directly available for control. So, one instead closes the loop with the controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where is an estimate of generated using quantized state values transmitted over the network. In Section III we will explain how is to be generated in various cases.</p><p>To model the systems arising in this way, we consider the following class of systems with jumps which is central to our approach:</p><p>(5) (6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where , , satisfy (1) and . Here (5) gives the closed-loop plant dynamics, while includes the network-induced error variables as well as some other auxiliary variables needed to implement the quantization procedure. We will show in Section III that several known classes of NCS and QCS, as well as their NQCS generalizations, can be written in the above form. Our approach will apply to all of these different systems in a unified manner. We adopt terminology from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and refer to as the maximum allowable transmission interval (MATI). We note that even for the NCS case, the above model is more general than the one considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> because the jump equation is allowed to depend explicitly on . For a precise definition of solutions to such systems, please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>We can assume that the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> is stable in an appropriate sense. Note that (8) is the "nominal" closed-loop system without the quantization and/or time scheduling (i.e., no bandwidth limitations), obtained from (5) by setting . Indeed, we will see in Section III that (8) is the same as (2), <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. However, we need to explicitly characterize robustness of the plant with respect to viewed as an exogenous input. We do this by employing the following (standard) notions; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for time-invariant systems and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for time-varying systems.</p><p>Definition 1: The system is input-to-state stable (ISS) from to if there exist functions and such that for all , , and each corresponding solution , we have that If the system is ISS with , a linear function and an exp-function, then we say that the system is ISS with a linear gain and an exp-function. A system with state and no input is uniformly globally asymptotically stable (UGAS) if for all and all corresponding solutions , we have that</p><p>The system is uniformly globally exponentially stable (UGES) if the above holds with a class exp-function . Motivated by the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we refer to the jump equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) as the network "protocol". Our main results in Section V are presented for a large class of "UGES protocols" that are characterized in Definition 2 stated below. To define this class of protocols, we introduce an auxiliary discrete-time system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>; here is a shorthand for while the variables on the right-hand side are evaluated at time step . We refer to (9) as a discrete-time system induced by the protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, or simply as a protocol. Note that we treat in the above equation as an input. Central to this paper is the following class of protocols 2 :</p><p>Definition 2: We say that the protocol ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is uniformly globally exponentially stable (UGES) with Lyapunov function if there exist , and such that we have (10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> for all , and all . In other words, the protocol ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is UGES with Lyapunov function if is a UGES Lyapunov function for the system (9). Sometimes we will simply refer to such protocols as Lyapunov UGES or just UGES protocols when the Lyapunov function is not being specified. Section IV contains many examples of various time-scheduling and quantization protocols, as well as proofs of their UGES properties. Linear bounds are used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> instead of more standard quadratic ones in order to streamline the calculations. This does not introduce a loss of generality since, given a function with quadratic bounds, we can just take its square root in order to obtain another function satisfying (10) (we will see such constructions in Section IV).</p><p>The following result is a corollary of main results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and in Section V it will be used to state a range of new emulation results for classes of NCS, QCS and NQCS that are introduced in Section III.</p><p>Theorem 1: Consider the system ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) with <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Suppose that the following conditions hold: 2 This definition was first used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for a smaller class of protocols of the form z = h(i; z) whose right hand side is independent of x. However, with the definition we use here, all main results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> still hold for the system ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>). i) System ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is ISS from to with linear gain , ; ii) Inequalities ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) hold, i.e., the protocol ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is Lyapunov UGES with a Lyapunov function ; iii) For some , we have that from item ii) and in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> for almost all , and . iv) MATI in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> satisfies where <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> is arbitrary, and come from ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), from item i), from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Then, the system ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is UGAS. Moreover, if the system ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is ISS from to with linear gain and exp-function , then the system ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is UGES.</p><p>The main idea behind the proof of this result is to use items ii)-iv) to show that the -subsystem is ISS with respect to , and then use item i) and invoke an ISS small-gain theorem (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) to prove stability of the overall closed-loop system; the MATI bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> ensures that the small-gain condition holds. Theorem 1 is general enough to cover many cases of interest and illustrate the unifying nature of our approach. We emphasize, however, that using results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> one can state a range of more general or alternative stability results, such as results based on stability and an appropriate small-gain theorem, which are omitted for space reasons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SYSTEM MODELS</head><p>In this section we demonstrate that models of various NCS and QCS that were previously considered in the literature, as well as NQCS that were not considered in the literature, can be written in the form ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>). This modelling framework is central to our approach as it allows us to unify, generalize, and compare many results in the literature. Indeed, we first show that models of NCS considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and references cited therein are a special case of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>). This fact was already observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> so we just quickly repeat the necessary steps for completeness and to illustrate the unifying nature of our results. Second, we show that models of QCS with "box" quantization protocols considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and the references therein are a special case of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. As far as we are aware, this is the first time that QCS are modelled in this particular form. Third, we show that one can combine general time-scheduling and "box" quantization protocols that are respectively used in NCS and QCS mentioned above in order to obtain a more general NQCS model that is still a special case of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Examples of such schemes can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Finally, we show that one can combine "zoom" protocols considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> with the time-scheduling protocols in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to obtain a model that is again a special case of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. These examples illustrate the unifying nature of our approach and we emphasize that the same framework could be useful in other situations not considered here.</p><p>In order to simplify the presentation, we consider static state feedback controllers and plants without disturbances, and we assume that only the state is sent over the network. Each of these simplifying assumptions can be relaxed. For instance, the NCS results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> were presented for dynamic output feedback controllers where both the control input and plant output are sent over the network. These results were further generalized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to cover general systems with exogenous disturbances. Output quantization was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and the QCS framework developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> covers both input and output quantization. Exogenous disturbances in QCS are the subject of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, since no unified treatment of NCS and QCS has been attempted in the literature, we choose to avoid these more challenging scenarios in order to make our models more transparent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. NCS</head><p>For the purpose of comparison and to illustrate the unifying nature of our results, we reproduce the class of models for NCS considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and show that it is a special case of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. In this and Sections III-B-D, we always assume that (1) holds. Consider a general nonlinear plant (2) where . It was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to first design a "nominal" controller (3) ignoring the effects of the network, so that the closed-loop system (2), ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is stable in an appropriate sense. The designed controller is then implemented over the network in the following manner. We assume that the vector is partitioned into , different subvectors enumerated from 1 to , i.e., . We refer to the th subvector as the th "node". At each transmission time , the protocol gives access to the network to one of the nodes . We consider general nonlinear NCS of the following form: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where is the vector of most recently transmitted plant state values via the network, is the network-induced error, and we closed the loop with the controller (4). We assume that is held constant between the transmission instants (i.e., we use a zero-order hold in each node). The function is typically such that, if the th node gets access to the network at some transmission time , the corresponding part of the error vector is reset to zero. However, neither of these assumptions (zero-order hold and resetting the error to zero) is necessary in the present framework, and both will be relaxed later in order to handle quantization effects. Rewriting the system in coordinates, we obtain the following NCS model: (15) (16) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> The system ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) has exactly the same form as ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) if we think of in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> as in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The error vector models the effects of the network and, since we assumed that NCS has nodes, it can be partitioned as . We refer to the jump equation ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) as a time-scheduling protocol. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, time-scheduling protocols with the maps of the following form were considered: <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where is some scheduling function <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> is the number of nodes, is the standard Kronecker delta, and are identity matrices of dimension , with . The above model of the protocol assumes that if the node is transmitted at time over the network, then . Examples of this class of protocols are given in Section IV-A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. QCS</head><p>We now consider the model for QCS described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for linear plants and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for nonlinear plants. Models considered elsewhere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>) are very similar. However, in the QCS literature these models have previously not been written in the way we do it here.</p><p>Let the plant be given by ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), where . We assume that a nominal feedback law (3) is given. When the state is quantized, this feedback law is not implementable. Instead, the control law will depend not on the state but on its estimate, , which we generate as follows. In between the times , we let <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> which is a "copy" of the plant dynamics. The initial condition can be arbitrary, e.g.,</p><p>. At each , we reset to a new value obtained from the quantized measurement. The quantizer, , is defined by three parameters: an integer (a given constant which defines the number of quantization levels), (the current state estimate), and</p><p>(an auxiliary variable which defines the size of the quantization regions). Consider a hypercubic box centered at with edges and divide it into equal smaller sub-boxes ( in each dimension), numbered from 1 to in some specific way. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> We let be the number of the sub-box that contains (provided that is indeed contained in one of them). The new value of is then defined to be the center of this box. This can be described by a jump equation of the form We also update to reflect the fact that the size of the box known to contain was divided by as the result of the above procedure:</p><p>Until the time , we propagate according to some differential equation and then the procedure is repeated. We can think of and as being implemented synchronously on both ends of the communication channel, i.e., in the encoder and the decoder, starting from some known initial values. Having defined , we can now also close the loop using the control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</p><p>It is convenient to rewrite the system dynamics in terms of the quantization-induced error . Suppressing the equations for and instead writing the equations for as before, we arrive at the closed-loop dynamics in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(22) (23) (24) (25) (26)</formula><p>where is given by ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> and This is similar to (15)-( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) and becomes a special case of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) if we define . Note that the equations for are not actually implemented, but only used for analysis. The above definition of allows us to fit QCS models (as well as NQCS models considered below) to the form ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, and consequently enables us to apply Definition 2 and Theorem 1 off-the-shelf. However, we will see in Remark 6 that sometimes one might want to treat and separately instead of combining them into a single vector.</p><p>To make sure that the quantizer is well defined, we need to assume that the initialization of and its evolution during continuous flows and jumps fulfills the following.</p><p>Assumption 1: A bound on the initial state is known and and are such that (28)</p><p>This assumption basically means that the quantizer will never saturate. It is easy to enforce this assumption when the plant is linear; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In fact, since the quantized measurements are only taken at the times , it is enough to require that (28) be satisfied at these times, and then we can set . Remark 1: QCS protocols considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and elsewhere do not assume a known initial bound on the state, and instead implement an initial "zooming-out" stage whose goal is to obtain such a bound in some finite time. Since the size of the quantization box must grow during this zooming-out stage, the corresponding protocols are not UGES and so our analysis does not directly apply to them. However, the MATI bounds we provide in this paper remain accurate for these systems since, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, zooming out can be implemented with a very coarse quantizer or a very large MATI.</p></div>

NQCS With "Box" Protocols</head><p>In this subsection, we combine quantization with time scheduling and show that the closed-loop system can be written in the form ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. As a special case, when there is only one node , we obtain the previous QCS model. We note also that a slightly different class of quantization protocols with "zoom" studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> can also be incorporated into our framework (see Section III-D below).</p><p>We again start with the plant (2) and the nominal control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. The next step is to implement this controller over a band-limited channel that will involve quantization and time scheduling. Namely, we apply the control law (4), where is an estimate of generated as explained next. In between the transmission times, is obtained by running a copy of the plant, given by ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>), in the encoder and decoder. As in Section III-A, we partition the state vector as , where is the number of nodes and each has dimension . The vector is partitioned accordingly as , and the error vector (29) is partitioned as .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. NQCS With "Zoom" Protocols</head><p>In this section we consider another class of quantization protocols and combine them with time-scheduling protocols. These protocols were considered (for the case of quantization only) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. That work in turn builds on the framework developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>; the models considered in these earlier papers differ only slightly from the ones we use in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and here. These quantization protocols are actually quite similar to the "box" protocols that we discussed in the previous subsections. The main difference is that typically, these zoom protocols do not strive to handle quantizers with as few quantization regions as possible, and consequently their implementation is somewhat more static; in particular, the center of the quantizer does not evolve according to a plant model between the transmission times as it does for "box" protocols. Some other differences between the two quantizer classes are purely notational, and these are reflected here to make a better link with the existing literature.</p><p>Assume that we are given quantizers , , where each is a finite (or countable) set of quantization points. Unlike in Section III-C, these quantizers do not have a moving center. Instead of describing them using the integer parameter , we assume the following.</p><p>Assumption 3: There exist strictly positive numbers and , such that the following holds for all and :</p><p>This formalism, proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, allows for quantization regions of general shapes, and incorporates as a special case rectilinear regions considered earlier in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Each quantizer also has a "zoom" parameter , whose role is similar to that of from Section III-C</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing</head><p>, we define the overall quantizer as Quantization is then combined with time scheduling in the same way as in Section III-C. At each , the value of is reset to Here we let between transmission times, which is actually more consistent with Section III-A. The vector of zoom parameters is also held constant between transmission times, while at transmission times we update it as follows: where and for each .

Assumption 4: A bound on the initial state is known and is such that for all we have If for all (i.e., all quantizers have infinite range), then Assumption 4 always holds. For finite-range quantizers, this assumption plays a role similar to that of Assumption 2, and it is not difficult to enforce it at least for linear plants (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). Remark 1 still applies here. We also note that in the presence of unknown external disturbances, we could not hope to satisfy Assumption 4 (or Assumption 2) from some time onward, and so more general quantization protocols would need to be employed; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. UGES PROTOCOLS</head><p>In this section we consider various examples of protocols that may arise in Sections III-A, B, C, and D. More importantly, we show for each of these protocols that they are UGES in the sense of Definition 2. It will become apparent from our proofs that many other protocols, not considered here, can be treated in a similar manner. In Section V, the technical proofs presented in this section are combined with Theorem 1 to obtain a range of new results for emulation of classes of systems considered in Section III. This general approach is novel for any system that involves quantization with or without time scheduling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. NCS Protocols</head><p>In this subsection, we consider protocols of the form (39) which arise in NCS considered in Section III-A; the function is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. We typically assume that if a node transmits at time , then is reset to zero at time , i.e., . In other words, we ignore possible quantization effects in this subsection. However, we emphasize that this assumption is not needed in general and this will become clear in the sequel. We present two examples of protocols from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and quote results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that show that these protocols are UGES. Besides serving to illustrate the unifying nature of our results, the RR and TOD protocols that we present next are used in the sequel to generate several genuinely new protocols that combine quantization and time scheduling. Hence, results presented here are useful for our subsequent analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Round Robin (RR) Protocol:</head><p>The simplest time-scheduling protocol is round robin in which the node is transmitted periodically with period , where is the total number of nodes.

We specify now the protocol for this situation. First, we note that the scheduling function becomes in this case (40)</p><p>The following result was proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We present the proof for completeness and because several proofs in the sequel rely on this computation. Proposition 2: The RR protocol (39), ( <ref type="formula">40</ref>) is UGES with the Lyapunov function , where denotes the solution of the discrete-time system (39), (40) at time starting at time and initial condition .

Moreover, note that for all and all</p><p>. Using this and also the fact that , we can write that (42) for all and all</p><p>. Furthermore, we have that for all and all , where (42) was used in the last step. Finally, with the definition we obtain that ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) hold with , , and , which completes the proof.</p><p>2) Try-Once-Discard (TOD) Protocol: In this section we consider the Try-Once-Discard (TOD) time-scheduling protocol proposed by Walsh et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, whose stability was analysed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In TOD protocol, the scheduling function takes the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(43)</formula><p>In other words, we compare the norms of errors and then transmit the node that corresponds to the largest error. If several errors are the same, we transmit the node with a minimum index (priority to transmit in this case can be chosen differently). It was explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> how TOD protocol can be implemented in Control Area Network (CAN); TOD cannot be directly implemented in many wired and any wireless networks.

As far as we are aware, this is the first analysis of stability properties for this protocol, taken separately from the continuous-time dynamics. However, protocols of this kind have been widely used in the literature as encoder/decoder models of communication channels between the plant and the controller; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> (although the focus in most of these works is somewhat different from the Lyapunov-based emulation design pursued here).

A somewhat similar (but more complicated) protocol was considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The function in (48) is given by (40) and the function is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. We know that satisfies (49). We let in (48) be given by <ref type="bibr">(50)</ref> where is the number of quantization levels for the corresponding quantizer (51) (note that the matrices and have different dimensions); is the Kronecker symbol; denotes the number of nodes used in the time scheduling. This means that is divided by while other components of remain unchanged.

Nevertheless, stability of linear NQCS with this protocol was proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> under appropriate conditions. definition of UGES protocols is too strong in this case and Theorem 1 cannot be applied directly. We will discuss in Section V how to modify our results to deal with this kind of situation (see <ref type="bibr">Remark 6)</ref>.</p><p>We prove next that the protocol (57) is UGES. Proposition 6: Suppose that (49) holds. Then, the protocol (57) is Lyapunov UGES.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. "Zoom" Protocols for NQCS</head><p>The focus of this subsection are protocols of the form (64) that arise in Section III-D. The protocol (64) combines time scheduling and quantization in a different manner from the protocols considered in the previous subsection. We are not aware of this class of protocols having been previously considered in the literature. In the special case when (no time scheduling) these protocols were considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We will combine RR and TOD protocols with the zooming quantization protocol and show that both of these combined protocols are UGES. A direct consequence of these results is that the zooming-in protocols considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> are UGES.</p><p>1) RR With Zoom Protocols: In this section, we consider the protocol (64) with defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and defined by (40).

This is exactly the situation considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and, hence, we can conclude that the zoom protocols considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> are UGES.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. MAIN RESULTS</head><p>In this section we demonstrate the utility and generality of our unifying approach to the controller emulation design for systems considered in Section III. In particular, we state a range of corollaries that provide MATI bounds guaranteeing stability for linear plants with linear emulated controllers and various quantization and/or time-scheduling UGES protocols considered in Section IV. This makes the formulas for MATI more concrete but we emphasize that the same approach can be applied to nonlinear plants with nonlinear (and dynamic) controllers. We thus consider the plant dynamics (65)</p><p>The first step in the emulation approach is to design a linear controller (66) so that the closed-loop system (65), (66) is exponentially stable, i.e., the matrix is Hurwitz. Note that at the controller design stage the network is ignored but the same controller is implemented over a band-limited channel that will involve quantization and/or time scheduling. In particular, we apply a linear controller <ref type="bibr">(67)</ref> where can be thought of as the estimate of and it can be obtained in different ways depending on the type of the network over which controller is implemented.</p><p>The second step in the emulation approach is to select an appropriate UGES protocol, such as the ones analyzed in Section IV, and implement the controller over an appropriate network with sufficiently small MATI. Hence, MATI is a design parameter and its upper bound that guarantees stability of the closed loop can be obtained by applying Theorem 1. To this end we will first show that the closed-loop model has the form ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Indeed, using (29) we rewrite the closed-loop system (65), (67) as follows:</p><p>(68) Note that (68) is a special case of the ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and this will be the same in each of the subsections that follow. However, ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) will take different forms in the subsequent subsections depending on the properties of the network and its protocol as specified in Section III and below.</p><p>In order to avoid repetitions in the proofs that follow, we outline the main steps common to all of them. It is clear that since is Hurwitz, the system (68) is ISS from to with a linear gain <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">5</ref>, and a class exp-function . Hence, item i) of Theorem 1 is satisfied. As explained above, we will assume that the network protocol is selected to be UGES and hence item ii) of Theorem 1 will also hold automatically in all the results that follow. Note that the Lyapunov functions will be different for different protocols and their derivations can be found in Section IV. The last thing to check is that item iii) of Theorem 1 holds for particular protocols that we will consider below and, finally, we would need to select MATI that is sufficiently small by applying the <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> in the item iv) of Theorem 1. Note that by using this approach we will be able to state many results on emulation for NCS, QCS as well as NQCS with various UGES protocols.</p></div>

Emulation of NCS</head><p>In this subsection we present two results for NCS systems that consist of linear plants with linear state feedback controllers with the full state being sent over the network. Moreover, we consider two cases of network protocols: RR and TOD protocols considered in Section IV-A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof of Proposition 5:</head><p>We construct the Lyapunov function for the protocol (52) in several steps. First, we construct a Lyapunov function for the -subsystem. Then, we construct an ISS Lyapunov function for the -subsystem when is regarded as an input. Finally, we combine the two functions (since the system is a cascade of two subsystems) into a Lyapunov function of the overall system. Thus the proof follows the pattern of the proof of Proposition 4, although the constructions and calculations are significantly more difficult.</p><p>Consider the -subsystem in (52), and denote the solution of this system at time starting from at time as . Consider the function <ref type="bibr">(53)</ref> where it is obvious that for all , . Moreover, note that for arbitrary and all , we have that and hence we can write for all and that Furthermore, we have that for all and all . Defining , we have for all that (54)</p><p>where , . Note that because and . Next, we find an ISS Lyapunov function for the -subsystem in (52) when is regarded as an input. To do this we first consider the system A Lyapunov function for this system is given in Proposition 2. We relabel this function as . Then, for all and we have Moreover, is globally Lipschitz with the Lipschitz constant equal to (see Lemma 2 in Appendix). We show that the same function is an ISS Lyapunov function for the -subsystem in (52):</p><p>(56) where we used the global Lipschitz property of , (49), and (54). Finally, we let where is strictly positive. We can write for all , , that Thus (10) holds since , and . Moreover, denoting , we show that (11) holds by using ( <ref type="formula">55</ref>) and (56) as follows:</p><p>where and was defined earlier.</p><p>Note that since . 2) TOD Protocol With Quantization: In this subsection we consider a combination of TOD protocol and quantization. We believe that this protocol has not been considered previously in the literature. The protocol is given by <ref type="bibr">(57)</ref> where is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, is defined in (51), is defined in (43), satisfies (49), and , where . In other words, the updated value of for any satisfies the following:</p><p>and .</p><p>(</p><p>The above protocol first compares the errors in individual nodes and then transmits a quantized version of the measurement in the node with the largest error. Note that the corresponding to this node is divided by after the transmission. Moreover, since we already know which node has the largest error, any of the 's corresponding to other nodes that are larger than are reset to be equal to (recall Assumption 2). In this manner the quantization protocol is working more efficiently.</p><p>for almost all that . The rest of the proof follows the same steps as in Corollary 9 and is omitted.</p><p>Remark 4: Note that for RR protocol given by (71) is smaller than for TOD protocol given by (72) whenever and they are equal when . Hence, one may be tempted to conclude that TOD protocol will perform better for larger values of MATI than the RR protocol. Unfortunately, this cannot be concluded from the above inequalities since our analysis is Lyapunov based and, hence, another choice of Lyapunov functions for the two protocols will lead to different expressions for . Nevertheless, it was observed in some examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> that the TOD protocol stabilized the system for larger MATI than the RR protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Emulation of QCS</head><p>In this subsection, we present results on emulation for QCS given in Section III-B and protocols given in Section IV-B. In this case, we will be running a copy of the plant in the encoder and decoder (73) and, hence, the error satisfies (74)</p><p>between the quantization updates. The evolution of between the quantization updates is given by (75)</p><p>While versions of the following result have already appeared in the literature, the proof given below is original as it uses Theorem 1 and the novel conclusion in Proposition 4.</p><p>Corollary 11: Consider the QCS (68), ( <ref type="formula">74</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">75</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) with the box protocol (46). Suppose that is designed so that is Hurwitz and let , be the ISS gain for the system (68) from to . Then, the QCS is UGES if MATI satisfies , where:</p><p>where comes from (46), is the dimension of , and .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof of Corollary 11:</head><p>The proof follows almost the same steps as the proof of Corollary 9 except that we now use the Lyapunov function that was used in Proposition 4. Note that in this case we have for almost all and that: Using the fact that , we can write for almost all and the proof can be completed in the same manner as before.</p><p>Remark 5: The formula for MATI in Corollary 11 for QCS is more conservative than the bound in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> given by (77) Indeed, note that in (76) can be arbitrarily small and as the formula (76) becomes</p><p>The reason for this is that in the proof of Corollary 11 we used the Euclidean norm of in the Lyapunov function . If, on the other hand, we use the Lyapunov function then we can recover the bound from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Indeed, by (46) and Assumption 1, we have and using the proof similar to the one presented in Proposition 4, we obtain that item ii) of Theorem 1 holds with , where , , , . Moreover, using Hölder's inequality we have 6   Hence, item iii) of Theorem 1 holds with and . Substituting these numbers into <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, we obtain and we recover (77) by letting . This illustrates the fact that the choice of Lyapunov function for the protocol does have an impact on the formula for MATI and exploiting this flexibility in particular cases to obtain the least conservative bounds on MATI is an option that the designer should consider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Emulation of NQCS With "Box" Protocols</head><p>In this section we consider a class of linear NQCS whose plant dynamics are given by (68). We use the same update for between transmission instants and, hence, the error evolves according to (74). We will consider the NQCS for the two protocols given in Section IV-C. In order to specify the -dynamics we write the error dynamics in more detail where the indices are consistent with the decomposition of the vector that will be used in the time-scheduling protocol; the matrices form a partition of the matrix that is consistent with the above partition of the error vector . As before, we assume that at any time instant a quantized value of only one is transmitted over the network. In order to define our quantization and the corresponding quantization protocol, we need to generate the auxiliary variable (78) and is chosen appropriately so that Assumption 2 holds. For example, we can define (78) via <ref type="bibr">(79)</ref> where the initial data satisfies . Then it is easy to show, using Bellman-Gronwall lemma and the arguments used to prove the standard comparison principle, that Assumption 2 holds. An alternative method is to use the vector comparison lemmas (see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). If the matrix has some structure, such as block-diagonal, then (79) simplifies (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>).</p><p>We apply Theorem 1 to the system (68), ( <ref type="formula">74</ref>), (78) with different UGES protocols.</p><p>1) RR Protocol With Quantization: A direct consequence of UGES of protocol (52) is the following:</p><p>Corollary 12: Consider the NQCS (68), ( <ref type="formula">74</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">78</ref>) with (1) and the protocol (52). Suppose that is designed so that is Hurwitz. Then, the system is UGES if MATI satisfies , where</p><p>where comes from Proposition 5 and . Proof of Corollary 12: First note that where and are given in the proof of Proposition 5. Using Lemmas 2 and 3 in Appendix we have that the following holds for almost all and :</p><p>Using this and the fact that and , we can write</p><p>The proof is completed by using formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> with and with coming from Proposition 5.</p><p>2) TOD Protocol With Quantization: The proof of the following result follows the same steps using the Lyapunov function from Proposition 6 and it is omitted.</p><p>Corollary 13: Consider the NQCS (68), ( <ref type="formula">74</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">78</ref>) with (1) and the protocol (57). Suppose that is designed so that is Hurwitz. Then, the system is UGES if MATI satisfies , where</p><p>and comes from Proposition 6. Remark 6: We revisit the protocol ( <ref type="formula">59</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">61</ref>) in Remark 2 that can be used to illustrate the flexibility of our approach.</p><p>To this end, we note that Theorem 1 was proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> by showing that items ii)-iv) of the Theorem imply that the subsystem ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) has a finite gain ISS gain from to . Moreover, this gain, denoted as , depends on MATI and we have that . Since in item i) of Theorem 1 we assume a finite ISS gain from to of the system (5), denoted as , we can apply the small-gain theorem and calculate for which the small-gain condition holds: , . This is exactly how the ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is obtained. While we cannot use directly Theorem 1 for this example, we can still use the above small-gain argument to prove stability with the protocol (59)-(61) under Assumption 2. (Note that the initial condition (62) violates Assumption 2.)</p><p>We begin by showing that the -subsystem is UGES in the sense of our Definition 2. This can be proved by using . From Lemma 1 in Appendix we have that:</p><p>. It is not hard to show that for linear systems also item iii) holds with and . Hence, the -subsystem is UGES (ISS with zero gain) for all where Moreover, we discussed already how one can adjust the parameters in the protocol so that Assumption 2 holds. Hence, we can conclude that for the same value of MATI the -subsystem is UGES for all initializations that satisfy Assumption 2. Hence, the system behaves like a cascade of the UGES -subsystem and a linear ISS -subsystem, and we can conclude that the overall NQCS is UGES. We note that in the preceding more systematic approach, which relies on an off-the-shelf application of Theorem 1, Assumption 2 was not used explicitly. Instead, we used its consequence (49) which is in principle more general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Emulation of NQCS With Zoom Protocols</head><p>In this section we consider NQCS of the form (37) in which the first two equations are linear and given by (68), (69). We consider the zoom protocols for NQCS whose stability properties were analyzed in Sections IV-D-1 and 2. Using similar arguments as before, we can obtain the following two results that are stated without proofs.</p><p>1) RR With Zoom Protocols: Corollary 14: Consider the NQCS (37) in which the first two equations are linear and given by (68), (69) and the protocol is given by (64) with (40).

Then, the system is UGES if MATI satisfies , where is given by ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) with and and , and come from Proposition 7.</p><p>2) TOD With Zoom Protocols: Corollary 15: Consider the NQCS (37) in which the first two equations are linear and given by ( <ref type="formula">68</ref>), (69) and the protocol is given by ( <ref type="formula">64</ref>) with (43).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we unified results on emulation for QCS and NCS by generalizing recently reported results for NCS in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. A central issue in our approach is proving stability properties of the corresponding quantization/time-scheduling protocols. We illustrated how this can be done for several representative protocols. Our approach is amenable to various generalizations, modifications and extensions, such as considering: persistently exciting protocols (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>) that are essential in wireless networked control systems; stochastic protocols and plants (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>); UGAS protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; and ISS protocols (see for instance the class of "zoom" protocols in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, discussed from this ISS viewpoint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). </p></div>
