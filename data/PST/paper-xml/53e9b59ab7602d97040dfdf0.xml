<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Given a graph or digraph G (in the sense of <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>), V(G) and E(G) denote its vertex-set and edge-set, respectively; the cardinalities IV(G) <ref type="bibr">(</ref> and IE(C)l are denoted by n(G) and m(G), briefly n and m, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>If S C V(G) then G(S) is the induced subgraph of G with vertex-set S .</head><p>The symbols L r J and r r 1 denote the greatest integer not exceeding the real number r and the smallest integer not less than r , respectively. If u is a vertex of a graph then ec(u) denotes the eccentricity of u. For digraphs it is necessary to consider both the maximal distance from u and the maximal distance to u; these are called the outeccentncity and ineccentricity of u and denoted by ec+(u) and ec-(u), respectively. The radius of a graph or digraph G, rad(G), is defined as min{max{ec'(u), ec-(u)}}, where the minimum is taken over all vertices u of G. The maximal distance in G is the diameter of G, diam(G).</p><p>The out-transmission of a vertex u of a graph or digraph G is defined by where d(u, x) is the distance from u to x. The intransmission is defined</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>symmetrically: cr-(u) = C d(x, u). The transmission of G is the value</head><p>Clearly, u(G) = C a + ( u ) = X Q-(u), where u ranges over all vertices of G. Note that we set d(x, y ) = ~1 if there is no x-y path. Since the case in which a(G) = m is not interesting, we will usually assume that G is strongly connected.</p><p>These "transmission numbers" have been investigated by several authors but under various names. (The choice of the terms used here has been influenced by [9, p. 1061.) The first results are due to Harary 1201. Being motivated by certain sociometric problems, he studied the "status" [ = a + ( u ) ] , "contrastatus" [ = cr-(u)], and "gross status" [ = u(G)I in digraphs (see also [22, p. 1851); <ref type="bibr">Kemeny and Snell [24]</ref> gave an axiom system for a measure of distance in a social group (digraph) and proved that any such a measure is intrinsically the status. Ng and Teh [29] found a strict lower bound for the transmission of digraphs. Ore [30, p. 301 suggested the ratio u + ( u ) / n as a measure of the "centrality" of a vertex u in a graph. This notion was studied for trees by Zelinka in [361 and 1371. In operations research a median is sought [a vertex u which minimizes ~'(LJ)]; there usually edge lengths of a given graph are prescribed and further generalizations are considered (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">[9, p. 1061</ref>). Several results concerning the out-transmissions in a graph can be found in Sabidussi [35]. Entringer, Jackson, and Snyder [17] summarized and extended several previous results and proved many new assertions about the "distance of u" [ = cr+(u)] and the "distance of G ' [ = fcr(G)] for graphs. Some of their results (especially bounds) will be quoted in latter sections.</p><p>Bounds on the transmission of a tree appeared also in Lovisz [U, Problem Our main purpose in this paper is to collect and extend some results about a(C), but sometimes it is more convenient to consider the ratio which is called the mean distance in G ( n 2 2). One sees that p(G) is the arithmetic mean of only all nonzero distances. This ensures that p(C) 3 I and, moreover, the equality holds iff G is a complete graph or digraph.</p><p>The concept of mean distance in a graph was first introduced by March The main contribution here is a sharp bound for strong nvertex tournaments. One section deals with the independence of the mean distance on the diameter or radius. This section is followed by some remarks about certain related NP-hard problems. The paper is concluded with further remarks and open questions.</p><p>Some results of the present paper were reported at the Third Czechoslovak Symposium on Graph Theory held in Prague, August 23-27, 1982.</p></div>

A similar proof for digraphs is provided by Theorem Proof. The inequality follows from Theorem I@). There exists exactly one strong tournament with n = 4 vertices and the mean distance for it is B. If n = 3 or 6 then one can find tournaments of diameter 2 and from these make such tournaments for all n 3 5 as follows. Given a tournament T, add two new vertices u,, uz, arc uIu2, and for any vertex u of T add arcs uuI and uzu. <ref type="bibr">One</ref>  Now we are going to give lower bounds depending on n and the diameter d.

Nevertheless, if only the dependence on n is considered, there are known sharp upper bounds for some classes of graphs and digraphs.</p><p>The following result appeared in Entringer, Jackson, and Snyder Moreover, this bound is achieved iff G is a path. Upper bounds will be more interesting if a considered class contains no tree. We shall now present such a result, but first we need a lemma. Proof. If G is a block then ec(u) g diam(G) S L i d d Lj(2n -2U. Therefore we can assume that G has at least two blocks and use induction on the number of blocks. Let GI be an endblock, Gz be the union of the remaining blocks of G, and let u be the only common vertex of GI and G2. We denote ni = n(Ci) for i = 1, 2 and distinguish two cases. Proof. One can suppose that G is a minimally 2-edge-connected graph. We proceed by induction on the number of blocks. First consider the case in which G is a block. For n c 5 the assertion can be verified directly and for n 2 6 Lemma 2 works as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">CT+(U) c L + d J s in' s f(n2 -n -2) s L f ( d -n)J .</formula><p>If G has at least two blocks then, as in the proof of Lemma 3, let GI be an endblock, Gz be the union of the other blocks, and u be the unique common vertex of G, and Gz (u is a cutvertex of C).

For the case in which nI 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> we prove the following stronger inequality:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">an: + (n -n,)3(2n, -2) + f [ ( n + 1 -nl)* -(n + 1 -nJ s f(nZ -n -2).</formula><p>(2) Denote the left-hand side of (2) by g(n, n,). Clearly, for any fixed n, g(n, n,) is a quadratic function of the variable n, and attains its maximum for n, = 2. Therefore, if nI 3 6 then the maximum is attained for n, = 6. One can easily verify that g(n, 6) &lt; f(n2n -2) and hence the inequality (2) holds. If n, 3 6 thenf(n, n,) s g(n, n,) and f(n2n -2) S Lf(n2n) J and thus also inequality (1) holds, which completes the proof in Case 1.</p></div>

We have seen that for the class of all trees or all 2-vertexconnected graphs there exists a maximum transmission graph with the maximum diameter.

Now Lemma 5 applies. I Finally we add a theorem related to Corollary 2. Its proof is based on the following result. Lemma 6 (Plesnik [341). The problem of finding out whether a graph (digraph) can be decomposed into two factors of diameter 2 is NP-hard. Theorem 11. The problem of decomposing a graph (digraph) into factors with the minimum sum of transmissions is NP-hard even in the case of two factors. Proof. Let G be a graph with n vertices and m edges which is decomposed into two factors FI and F2 with m i and m2 edges, respectively. By Theorem I(a) cr(F,) 3 2n(n -1) -2ml and d F 2 ) 3 2n(n -1) -2m2. Thus u(FJ + 4 F 2 ) 2 4n(n -1) -2m and the equality holds iff both the preceding inequalities are equalities, i.e., iff diam(F,) = diam(F2) = 2. Therefore the minimum of a(FJ + a(F2) is equal to 4n(n -1) -2m iff both the factors have diameter 2. Now Lemma 6 applies. Fully analogous arguments work for digraphs if Theorem l(b) is used. i 7. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND OPEN QUESTIONS Remark 8. It seems that the techniques we have used will not suffice to provide upper bounds on a(G) for several important classes of nvertex graphs: k-vertex-connected or k-edge-connected graphs (k 3 31, k-regular connected graphs (k 3 3), and others.</figDesc></figure>

There are several papers dealing with the mean distance and thus the transmission. Doyle and Graver treated graphs in [I21 and digraphs in [13]. Then in (141 and [IS] they used weighted graphs (with rational edge lengths) to represent shapes (comdor anangements). Through a limiting process they were able to amve at a concept for mean distance in shapes. Buckley<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> studied the mean distance in line graphs. Buckley and Superville [7] have determined the mean distance for various simple classes of graphs. Particular attention in[6] and [7] is given to the case in which the mean distance and the radius are equal. The mean distance is easily calculated if the graph or digraph has much symmetry, for example in the case of distance degree regular graphs (seeBloom, Kennedy,   </figDesc><table /><note><p><p><p>and Steadman [27, and Quintas</p>[4]</p>). In general a shortest-path algorithm (see, e.g., [9]) must be used [12]. The mean distances of all graphs with n 6 6 and all digraphs with n =s 4 can be found in [13]. This paper is divided into several sections. First we give lower bounds on a ( G ) depending either on n and m, or only on n or on n and the diameter. Next we deal mainly with upper bounds on the transmission for 2-vertex-connected and for 2-edge-connected graphs with n vertices. Another section is devoted to upper bounds on the transmission for digraphs.</p></note></figure>
