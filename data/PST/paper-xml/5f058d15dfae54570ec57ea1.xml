<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>While image classification models have recently continued to advance, most downstream applications such as object detection and semantic segmentation still employ ResNet variants as the backbone network due to their simple and modular structure. We present a modular Split-Attention block that enables attention across feature-map groups. By stacking these Split-Attention blocks ResNet-style, we obtain a new ResNet variant which we call ResNeSt. Our network preserves the overall ResNet structure to be used in downstream tasks straightforwardly without introducing additional computational costs. ResNeSt models outperform other networks with similar model complexities. For example, ResNeSt-50 achieves 81.13% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using a single crop-size of 224 × 224, outperforming previous best ResNet variant by more than 1% accuracy. This improvement also helps downstream tasks including object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation. For example, by simply replace the ResNet-50 backbone with ResNeSt-50, we improve the mAP of Faster-RCNN on MS-COCO from 39.3% to 42.3% and the mIoU for DeeplabV3 on ADE20K from 42.1% to 45.1% 1 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision research. Networks trained for image classification often serve as the backbone of the neural networks designed for other applications, such as object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, semantic segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref> and pose estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>. Recent work has significantly boosted image classification accuracy through large scale neural architecture search (NAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Despite their state-of-the-art performance, these NAS-derived models are usually not optimized for training efficiency or memory usage on general/commercial processing hardware (CPU/GPU) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Due to excessive memory consumption, some of the larger versions of these models are Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: (Left) Accuracy and latency trade-off on GPU using official code implementation (details in <ref type="bibr">Section 5)</ref>. (Right-Top) Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using ResNeSt. (Right-Bottom) Transfer learning results: object detection mAP on MS-COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and semantic segmentation mIoU on ADE20K <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p><p>not even trainable on a GPU with an appropriate per-device batch-size<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. This has limited the adoption of NAS-derived models for other applications, especially tasks involving dense predictions such as segmentation.</p><p>Most recent work on downstream applications still uses the ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> or one of its variants as the backbone CNN. Its simple and modular design can be easily adapted to various tasks. However, since ResNet models are originally designed for image classification, they may not be suitable for various downstream applications because of the limited receptive-field size and lack of cross-channel interaction. This means that boosting performance on a given computer vision task requires "network surgery" to modify the ResNet to be more effective for that particular task. For example, some methods add a pyramid module <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref> or introduce long-range connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> or use cross-channel feature-map attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. While these approaches do improve the transfer learning performance for certain tasks, they raise the question: Can we create a versatile backbone with universally improved feature representations, thereby improving performance across multiple tasks at the same time? Cross-channel information has demonstrated success in downstream applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>, while recent image classification networks have focused more on group or depth-wise convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. Despite their superior computation and accuracy tradeoff in classification tasks, these models do not transfer well to other tasks as their isolated representations cannot capture cross-channel relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Therefore, a network with cross-channel representations is desirable.</p><p>As the first contribution of this paper, we explore a simple architectural modification of the ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, incorporating feature-map split attention within the individual network blocks. More specifically, each of our blocks divides the feature-map into several groups (along the channel dimension) and finer-grained subgroups or splits, where the feature representation of each group is determined via a weighted combination of the representations of its splits (with weights cho-sen based on global contextual information). We refer to the resulting unit as a Split-Attention block, which remains simple and modular. By stacking several Split-Attention blocks, we create a ResNet-like network called ResNeSt (S stands for "split"). Our architecture requires no more computation than existing ResNet-variants, and is easy to be adopted as a backbone for other vision tasks.</p><p>The second contributions of this paper are large scale benchmarks on image classification and transfer learning applications. We find that models utilizing a ResNeSt backbone are able to achieve state of the art performance on several tasks, namely: image classification, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation. The proposed ResNeSt outperforms all existing ResNet variants and has the same computational efficiency and even achieves better speed-accuracy trade-offs than state-of-the-art CNN models produced via neural architecture search <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> as shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Our single Cascade-RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> model using a ResNeSt-101 backbone achieves 48.3% box mAP and 41.56% mask mAP on MS-COCO instance segmentation. Our single DeepLabV3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> model, again using a ResNeSt-101 backbone, achieves mIoU of 46.9% on the ADE20K scene parsing validation set, which surpasses the previous best result by more than 1% mIoU. Additional results can be found in Sections 5 and 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Modern CNN Architectures. Since AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, deep convolutional neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> have dominated image classification. With this trend, research has shifted from engineering handcrafted features to engineering network architectures. NIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> first uses a global average pooling layer to replace the heavy fully connected layers, and adopts 1 × 1 convolutional layers to learn non-linear combination of the featuremap channels, which is the first kind of featuremap attention mechanism. VGG-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> proposes a modular network design strategy, stacking the same type of network blocks repeatedly, which simplifies the workflow of network design and transfer learning for downstream applications. Highway network <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> introduces highway connections which makes the information flow across several layers without attenuation and helps the network convergence. Built on the success of the pioneering work, ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> introduces an identity skip connection which alleviates the difficulty of vanishing gradient in deep neural network and allows network learning deeper feature representations. ResNet has become one of the most successful CNN architectures which has been adopted in various computer vision applications.</p><p>Multi-path and Feature-map Attention. Multi-path representation has shown success in GoogleNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, in which each network block consists of different convolutional kernels. ResNeXt <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> adopts group convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> in the ResNet bottle block, which converts the multi-path structure into a unified operation. SE-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> introduces a channel-attention mechanism by adaptively recalibrating the channel feature responses. SK-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> brings the feature-map attention across two network branches. Inspired by the previous methods, our Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Comparing our ResNeSt block with SE-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and SK-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. A detailed view of Split-Attention unit is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. For simplicity, we show ResNeSt block in cardinality-major view (the featuremap groups with same cardinal group index reside next to each other). We use radix-major in the real implementation, which can be modularized and accelerated by group convolution and standard CNN layers (see supplementary material).</p><p>network generalizes the channel-wise attention into feature-map group representation, which can be modularized and accelerated using unified CNN operators.</p><p>Neural Architecture Search. With increasing computational power, interest has begun shifting from manually designed architectures to systematically searched architectures which are adaptively tailored to a particular task. Recent neural architecture search algorithms have adaptively produced CNN architectures that achieved state-of-the-art classification performance, such as: Amoe-baNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, MNASNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, and EfficientNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Despite their great success in image classification, the meta network structures are distinct from each other, which makes it hard for downstream models to build upon. Instead, our model preserves ResNet meta structure, which can be directly applied on many existing downstream models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. Our approach can also augment the search spaces for neural architecture search and potentially improve the overall performance, which can be studied in the future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Split-Attention Networks</head><p>We now introduce the Split-Attention block, which enables feature-map attention across different feature-map groups. Later, we describe our network instantiation and how to accelerate this architecture via standard CNN operators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Split-Attention Block</head><p>Our Split-Attention block is a computational unit, consisting feature-map group and split attention operations. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (Right) depicts an overview of a Split-Attention Block.</p><p>Feature-map Group. As in ResNeXt blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, the feature can be divided into several groups, and the number of feature-map groups is given by a cardinality hyperparameter K. We refer to the resulting feature-map groups as cardinal groups. We introduce a new radix hyperparameter R that indicates the number of splits within a cardinal group, so the total number of feature groups is G = KR. We may apply a series of transformations {F 1 , F 2 , ...F G } to each individual group, then the intermediate representation of each group is Split Attention in Cardinal Groups. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, a combined representation for each cardinal group can be obtained by fusing via an element-wise summation across multiple splits. The representation for k-th car- <ref type="figure">and H</ref>, W and C are the block output feature-map sizes. Global contextual information with embedded channel-wise statistics can be gathered with global average pooling across spatial dimensions s k ∈ R C/K <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Here the c-th component is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U i = F i (X), for i ∈ {1, 2, ...G}.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">dinal group is Û k = Rk j=R(k−1)+1 U j , where Û k ∈ R H×W ×C/K for k ∈ 1, 2, ...K,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">s k c = 1 H × W H i=1 W j=1 Û k c (i, j).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>A weighted fusion of the cardinal group representation V k ∈ R H×W ×C/K is aggregated using channel-wise soft attention, where each feature-map channel is produced using a weighted combination over splits. The c-th channel is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V k c = R i=1 a k i (c)U R(k−1)+i ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where a k i (c) denotes a (soft) assignment weight given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">a k i (c) =    exp(G c i (s k )) R j=0 exp(G c j (s k )) if R &gt; 1, 1 1+exp(−G c i (s k )) if R = 1,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and mapping G c i determines the weight of each split for the c-th channel based on the global context representation s k .</p><p>ResNeSt Block. The cardinal group representations are then concatenated along the channel dimension: V = Concat{V 1 , V 2 , ...V K }. As in standard residual blocks, the final output Y of our Split-Attention block is produced using a shortcut connection: Y = V + X, if the input and output feature-map share the same shape. For blocks with a stride, an appropriate transformation T is applied to the shortcut connection to align the output shapes: Y = V + T (X). For example, T can be strided convolution or combined convolution-with-pooling.</p><p>Instantiation, Acceleration, and Computational Costs. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (right) shows an instantiation of our Split-Attention block, in which the group transformation F i is a 1×1 convolution followed by a 3×3 convolution, and the attention weight function G is parameterized using two fully connected layers with ReLU activation. We draw this figure in a cardinality-major view (the featuremap groups with same cardinality index reside next to each other) for easily describing the overall logic. By switching the layout to a radix-major view, this block can be easily accelerated using standard CNN layers (such as group convolution, group fully connected layer and softmax operation), which we will describe in details in the supplementary material. The number of parameters and FLOPS of a Split-Attention block are roughly the same as a residual block <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref> with the same cardinality and number of channels.</p><p>Relation to Existing Attention Methods. First introduced in SE-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the idea of squeeze-and-attention (called excitation in the original paper) is to employ a global context to predict channel-wise attention factors. With radix = 1, our Split-Attention block is applying a squeeze-and-attention operation to each cardinal group, while the SE-Net operates on top of the entire block regardless of multiple groups. Previous models like SK-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> introduced feature attention between two network branches, but their operation is not optimized for training efficiency and scaling to large neural networks. Our method generalizes prior work on feature-map attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> within a cardinal group setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, and its implementation remains computationally efficient. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows an overall comparison with SE-Net and SK-Net blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Network and Training</head><p>We now describe the network design and training strategies used in our experiments. First, we detail a couple of tweaks that further improve performance, some of which have been empirically validated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Network Tweaks</head><p>Average Downsampling. When downstream applications of transfer learning are dense prediction tasks such as detection or segmentation, it becomes essential to preserve spatial information. Recent ResNet implementations usually apply the strided convolution at the 3 × 3 layer instead of the 1 × 1 layer to better preserve such information <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Convolutional layers require handling featuremap boundaries with zero-padding strategies, which is often suboptimal when transferring to other dense prediction tasks. Instead of using strided convolution at the transitioning block (in which the spatial resolution is downsampled), we use an average pooling layer with a kernel size of 3 × 3 .</p><p>Tweaks from ResNet-D. We also adopt two simple yet effective ResNet modifications introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>: (1) The first 7 × 7 convolutional layer is replaced with three consecutive 3 × 3 convolutional layers, which have the same receptive field size with a similar computation cost as the original design. (2) A 2 × 2 average pooling layer is added to the shortcut connection prior to the 1 × 1 convolutional layer for the transitioning blocks with stride of two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Training Strategy</head><p>Large Mini-batch Distributed Training. Following prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, we train our models using 8 servers (64 GPUs in total) in parallel. Our learning rates are adjusted according to a cosine schedule <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. We follow the common practice using linearly scaling-up the initial learning rate based on the minibatch size. The initial learning rate is given by η = B 256 η base , where B is the mini-batch size and we use η base = 0.1 as the base learning rate. This warm-up strategy is applied over the first 5 epochs, gradually increasing the learning rate linearly from 0 to the initial value for the cosine schedule <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. The batch normalization (BN) parameter γ is initialized to zero in the final BN operation of each block, as has been suggested for large batch training <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Label Smoothing Label smoothing was first used to improve the training of Inception-V2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Recall the cross entropy loss incurred by our network's predicted class probabilities q is computed against ground-truth p as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(p, q) = − K i=1 p i log q i ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where K is total number of classes, p i is the ground truth probability of the i-th class, and q i is the network's predicted probability for the i-th class. As in standard image classification, we define:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">q i = exp(zi) K j=1 exp(zj )</formula><p>where z i are the logits produced by our network's ouput layer. When the provided labels are classes rather than class-probabilities (hard labels), p i = 1 if i equals the ground truth class c, and is otherwise = 0. Thus in this setting: hard (p, q) = − log q c = −z c + log( K j=1 exp(z j )). During the final phase of training, the logits z j tend to be very small for j = c, while z c is being pushed to its optimal value ∞, and this can induce overfitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. Rather than assigning hard labels as targets, label smoothing uses a smoothed ground truth probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p i = 1 − ε if i = c, ε/(K − 1) otherwise<label>(5)</label></formula><p>with small constant ε &gt; 0. This mitigates network overconfidence and overfitting.</p><p>Auto Augmentation. Auto-Augment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is a strategy that augments the training data with transformed images, where the transformations are learned adaptively. 16 different types of image jittering transformations are introduced, and from these, one augments the data based on 24 different combinations of two consecutive transformations such as shift, rotation, and color jittering. The magnitude of each transformation can be controlled with a relative parameter (e.g. rotation angle), and transformations may be probabilistically skipped. A search which tries various candidate augmentation policies returns the best 24 best combinations. One of these 24 policies is then randomly chosen and applied to each sample image during training. The original Auto-Augment implementation uses reinforcement learning to search over these hyperparameters, treating them as categorical values in a discrete search space. For continuous search spaces, it first discretizes the possible values before searching for the best.</p><p>Mixup Training. Mixup is another data augmentation strategy that generates a weighted combinations of random image pairs from the training data <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>Given two images and their ground truth labels: (x (i) , y (i) ), (x (j) , y (j) ), a synthetic training example (x, ŷ) is generated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x = λx i + (1 − λ)x j ,<label>(6) ŷ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">= λy i + (1 − λ)y j ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where λ ∼ Beta(α = 0.2) is independently sampled for each augmented example. Regularization. Very deep neural networks tend to overfit even for large datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. To prevent this, dropout regularization randomly masks out some neurons during training (but not during inference) to form an implicit network ensemble <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. A dropout layer with the dropout probability of 0.2 is applied before the final fully-connected layer to the networks with more than 200 layers. We also apply DropBlock layers to the convolutional layers at the last two stages of the network. As a structured variant of dropout, DropBlock <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> randomly masks out local block regions, and is more effective than dropout for specifically regularizing convolutional layers. Finally, we also apply weight decay (i.e. L2 regularization) which additionally helps stabilize training. Prior work on large mini-batch training suggests weight decay should only be applied to the weights of convolutional and fully connected layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. We do not subject any of the other network parameters to weight decay, including bias units, γ and β in the batch normalization layers.</p><p>#P GFLOPs acc(%) ResNetD-50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>  For example 2s2x40d denotes radix=2, cardinality=2 and width=40. Note that even radix=1 does not degrade any existing approach (see Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Image Classification Results</head><p>Our first experiments study the image classification performance of ResNeSt on the ImageNet 2012 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> with 1.28M training images and 50K validation images (from 1000 different classes). As is standard, networks are trained on the training set and we report their top-1 accuracy on the validation set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Implementation Details</head><p>We use data sharding for distributed training on ImageNet, evenly partitioning the data across GPUs. At each training iteration, a mini-batch of training data is sampled from the corresponding shard (without replacement). We apply the transformations from the learned Auto Augmentation policy to each individual image. Then we further apply standard transformations including: random size crop, random horizontal flip, color jittering, and changing the lighting. Finally, the image data are RGB-normalized via mean/standard-deviation rescaling. For mixup training, we simply mix each sample from the current mini-batch with its reversed order sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Batch Normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is used after each convolutional layer before ReLU activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Network weights are initialized using Kaiming Initialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. A drop layer is inserted before the final classification layer with dropout ratio = 0.2. Training is done for 270 epochs with a weight decay of 0.0001 and momentum of 0.9, using a cosine learning rate schedule with the first 5 epochs reserved for warm-up. We use a mini-batch of size 8192 for ResNeSt-50, 4096 for ResNeSt 101, and 2048 for ResNeSt-{200, 269}. For evaluation, we first resize each image to 1/0.875 of the crop size along the short edge and apply a center crop. Our code implementation for ImageNet training uses GluonCV <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> with MXNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>

We conduct an ablation study on ResNeSt-variants with different radix/cardinality. In each variant, we adjust the network's width appropriately so that its overall computational cost remains similar to the ResNet variants. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, where s denotes the radix, x the cardinality, and d the network width (0s represents the use of a standard residual block as in ResNet-D <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). We empirically find that increasing the radix from 0 to 4 continuously improves the top-1 accuracy, while also increasing latency and memory usage. Although we expect further accuracy improvements with even greater radix/cardinality, we employ Split-Attention with the 2s1x64d setting in subsequent experiments, to ensure these blocks scale to deeper networks with a good trade-off between speed, accuracy and memory usage. .

To compare with CNN models trained using different crop size settings, we increase the training crop size for deeper models. We use a crop size of 256 × 256 for ResNeSt-200 and 320 × 320 for ResNeSt-269. Bicubic upsampling strategy is employed for input-size greater than 256. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>, where we compare the inference speed in addition to the number of parameters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Object Detection</head><p>We report our detection result on MS-COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>  2017 validation set with 5k images (aka. minival) using the standard COCO AP metric of single scale.

We conduct Faster-RCNNs and Cascade-RCNNs experiments using Detectron2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. For comparison, we simply replaced the vanilla ResNet backbones with our ResNeSt, while using the default settings for the hyper-parameters and detection heads <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. Compared to the baselines using standard ResNet, Our backbone is able to boost mean average precision by around 3% on both Faster-RCNNs and Cascade-RCNNs. The result demonstrates our backbone has good generalization ability and can be easily transferred to the downstream task. Notably, our ResNeSt50 outperforms ResNet101 on both Faster-RCNN and Cascade-RCNN detection models, using significantly fewer parameters. Detailed results in Table <ref type="table">10</ref>. We evaluate our Cascade-RCNN with ResNeSt101 deformable, that is trained using 1x learning rate schedule on COCO test-dev set as well. It yields a box mAP of 49.2 using single scale inference.</p></div>

For data augmentation, input images' shorter side are randomly scaled to one of (640, 672, 704, 736, 768, 800). To fairly compare it with other methods, 1x learning rate schedule policy is applied, and other hyper-parameters remain the same. We re-train the baseline with the same setting described above, but with the standard ResNet. All our  As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>, our new backbone achieves better performance. For Mask-RCNN, ResNeSt50 outperforms the baseline with a gain of 2.85%/2.09% for box/mask performance, and ResNeSt101 exhibits even better improvement of 4.03%/3.14%. For Cascade-Mask-RCNN, the gains produced by switching to ResNeSt50 or ResNeSt101 are 3.13%/2.36% or 3.51%/3.04%, respectively. This suggests a model will be better if it consists of more Split-Attention modules. As observed in the detection results, the mAP of our ResNeSt50 exceeds the result of the standard ResNet101 backbone, which indicates a higher capacity of the small model with our proposed module. Finally, we also train a Cascade-Mask-RCNN with ResNeSt101-deformable using a 1x learning rate schedule. We evaluate it on the COCO test-dev set, yielding 50.0 box mAP, and 43.1 mask mAP respectively. Additional experiments under different settings are included in the supplementary material.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>This work proposed the ResNeSt architecture with a novel Split-Attention block that universally improves the learned feature representations to boost performance across image classification, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation. In the latter downstream tasks, the empirical improvement produced by simply switching the backbone network to our ResNeSt is substantially better than task-specific modifications applied to a standard backbone such as ResNet. Our Split-Attention block is easy to work with and computationally efficient, and thus should be broadly applicable across vision tasks. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Radix-major implementation of ResNeSt block, where the featuremap groups with same radix index but different cardinality are next to each other physically. This implementation can be easily accelerated, because the 1×1 convolutional layers can be unified into a layer and the 3×3 convolutional layers can be implemented using group convolution with the number of groups equal to RK.</p><p>For easily visualizing the concept of Split-Attention, we employ cardinalitymajor implementation in the methods description of the main paper, where the groups with the same cardinal index reside next to each other physically. The cardinality-major implementation is straightforward and intuitive, but is difficult to modularize and accelerate using standard CNN operators. Therefore, we adopt the radix-major implementation in our experiments.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> gives an overview of the Split-Attention block in radix-major layout. The input feature-map is first divided into RK groups, in which each group has a cardinality-index and radix-index. In this layout, the groups with same radix-index reside next to each other in the memory. Then, we can conduct a summation across different splits, so that the feature-map groups with the same cardinality-index but different radixindex are fused together. This operation is identical to fuse across splits within each cardinal groups in the cardinality-major implementation described in the main paper. Similarly, a global pooling layer aggregates over the spatial dimension, while keeps the channel dimension separated, which is the same as conducting global pooling to each individual cardinal groups then concatenate the results. Then two consecutive fully connected (FC) layers with number of groups equal to cardinality are added after pooling layer to predict the attention weights for each splits. The use of grouped FC layers makes it identical to apply each pair of FCs separately on top each cardinal groups.</p><p>With this implementation, the first 1 × 1 convolutional layers can be unified into one layer and the 3×3 convolutional layers can be implemented using a single grouped convolution with the number of groups of RK. Therefore, the Split-Attention block is modularized and implemented using standard CNN operators.</p></div>
