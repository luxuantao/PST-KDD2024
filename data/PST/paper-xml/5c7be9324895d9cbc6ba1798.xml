<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When solving constrained optimization problems by evolutionary algorithms, an important issue is how to balance constraints and objective function. This paper presents a new method to address the above issue. In our method, after generating an offspring for each parent in the population by making use of differential evolution (DE), the well-known feasibility rule is used to compare the offspring and its parent. Since the feasibility rule prefers constraints to objective function, the objective function information has been exploited as follows: if the offspring cannot survive into the next generation and if the objective function value of the offspring is better than that of the parent, then the offspring is stored into a predefined archive. Subsequently, the individuals in the archive are used to replace some individuals in the population according to a replacement mechanism. Moreover, a mutation strategy is proposed to help the population jump out of a local optimum in the infeasible region. Note that, in the replacement mechanism and the mutation strategy, the comparison of individuals is based on objective function. In addition, the information of objective function has also been utilized to generate offspring in DE. By the above processes, this paper achieves an effective balance between constraints and objective function in constrained evolutionary optimization. The performance of our method has been tested on two sets of benchmark test functions, namely, 24 test functions at IEEE CEC2006 and 18 test functions with 10-D and 30-D at IEEE CEC2010.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>W ITHOUT loss of generality, constrained optimization problems (COPs) can be formulated as follows: minimize f ( x), x = (x 1 , . . . , x D ) ∈ S, L i ≤ x i ≤ U i subject to: g j ( x) ≤ 0, j = 1, . . . , l h j ( x) = 0, j = l + 1, . . . , m where x is the decision vector, x i is the ith decision variable, L i and U i are the lower and upper bounds of x i , respectively, D is the number of decision variables, S = D i=1 [L i , U i ] is the decision space, f ( x) is the objective function, g j ( x) is the jth inequality constraint, h j ( x) is the (jl)th equality constraint, l is the number of inequality constraints, and (ml) is the number of equality constraints.</p><p>For COPs, the degree of constraint violation of a decision vector x on the jth constraint is computed via the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G j ( x) = max{0, g j ( x)}, 1 ≤ j ≤ l max{0, |h j ( x)| -δ}, l + 1 ≤ j ≤ m (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where δ is a positive tolerance value to relax equality constraints to a certain extent. Then, G( x) = m j=1 G j ( x) represents the degree of constraint violation of x on all constraints. In the context of (1), a decision vector x is called a feasible solution if G( x) = 0, otherwise x is called an infeasible solution. The decision space of a COP is composed of the feasible region and the infeasible region. The former is the set of all feasible solutions and the latter is the set of all infeasible solutions.</p><p>In the field of evolutionary computation, there has been a growing interest in applying evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to solve COPs. Due to the presence of constraints, many constrain-handling techniques have been suggested and integrated with EAs, and as a result, a variety of constrained optimization EAs (COEAs) have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The current popular constraint-handling techniques can be briefly classified into three categories: 1) methods based on penalty functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>; 2) methods based on the preference of feasible solutions over infeasible solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>; and 3) methods based on multiobjective optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Actually, after producing an offspring population for the parent population by EAs, the purpose of constraint-handling techniques is to determine a criterion to compare the individuals in the parent and offspring populations. The methods based on penalty functions construct a fitness function by adding a penalty term proportional to the constraint violation into objective function, and then uses this fitness function to compare the individuals. In the methods based on the preference of feasible solutions over infeasible solutions, the comparison of individuals is based on either the degree of constraint violation or objective function. Moreover, feasible solutions are always considered to be better than infeasible ones to a certain degree. In addition, the methods based on multiobjective optimization transform a COP into a multiobjective optimization problem with two objectives [i.e., ( f ( x), G( x))] or a multiobjective optimization problem with (m + 1) objectives [i.e., ( f ( x), G 1 ( x), . . . , G m ( x))]. After the above transformation, Pareto dominance is usually employed to compare the individuals.</p><p>In general, COEAs have two main tasks: 1) entering the feasible region rapidly and 2) finding the optimal solution at the end. In order to accomplish the first task, the comparison of individuals is dependent mainly on constraints in most of constraint-handling techniques. As a result, the information of objective function has been neglected unreasonably, which has a negative effect on the achievement of the second task.</p><p>Motivated by the above consideration, this paper proposes a new COEA. We call this approach as the feasibility rule with the incorporation of objective function information (FROFI). In FROFI, differential evolution (DE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> serves as the search engine and the well-known feasibility rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is used to compare the individuals in the population. During the evolution, if an offspring generated by DE is worse than the parent according to the feasibility rule and if the offspring has a better objective function value than its parent, the offspring will be stored into a predefined archive. Afterward, the individuals in the archive are used to replace some individuals in the population by a replacement mechanism. In addition, a mutation strategy is proposed. It is noteworthy that the comparison of individuals is based on objective function in both the replacement mechanism and the mutation strategy. Moreover, the information of objective function has also been used to guide the search in DE.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.</p><p>1) Due to the fact that the feasibility rule prefers constraints to objective function, FROFI incorporates the objective function information into the feasibility rule by three processes: a) the DE operators; b) the replacement mechanism; and c) the mutation strategy. The purpose of the DE operators is to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of FROFI. The replacement mechanism is able to diversify the population at the early stage of evolution and enhance the convergence speed at the middle and later stages of evolution. In addition, the mutation strategy aims at alleviating premature convergence in the infeasible region. By the above three processes, overall, FROFI reaches a reasonable tradeoff between constraints and objective function. 2) Systematic experiments have been conducted to compare FROFI with other well-established methods on two sets of benchmark test functions, namely, 24 test functions at IEEE CEC2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and 18 test functions with 10-D and 30-D at IEEE CEC2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The experimental results have indicated that FROFI is better than or at least comparable to other methods and has good scalability to the number of decision variables. Moreover, FROFI has also been applied to solve constrained mechanical design optimization problems and constrained multiobjective optimization problems.</p><p>3) The effectiveness of the replacement mechanism and the mutation strategy and the sensitivity of the parameter associated with the replacement mechanism have been experimentally investigated. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces DE and the feasibility rule. Section III describes the related work. The proposed method, FROFI, is elaborated in Section IV. Section V presents the performance analysis and comparison, and more experimental studies on FROFI. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> in 1995. Like other EA paradigms, DE is a population-based optimization method. The population of DE can be expressed as follows:</p></div>

In 2011, Mezura-Montes and Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> carried out a comprehensive survey on constraint-handling in nature-inspired numerical optimization. Recent developments during the last four years are briefly outlined below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Methods Based on Penalty Functions</head><p>Kusakci and Can <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> integrated a modified covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> with a penalty approach introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. de Melo and Iacca <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> modified the stopping criteria and the sampling mechanism of CMA-ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and introduced an adaptive penalty function into the modified CMA-ES. Ali and Zhu <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposed a constrained DE equipped with penalty function. Moreover, they provided theoretical results about the setting of the penalty coefficient. Hernández et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed a hybridization of DE and hill climbing, which employs static penalty to deal with constraints. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, a rough penalty method inspired by Pawlak's rough set theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is proposed and coupled with an improved genetic algorithm. Li and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposed an interesting piece of work, in which the minimum penalty coefficient is estimated at each generation. Wang and Cai <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> proposed (μ+λ)-CDE, which divides the evolutionary process into three situations: 1) infeasible situation; 2) semi-feasible situation; and 3) feasible situation. In the semi-feasible situation, an adaptive penalty function is devised. Based on the constraint-handling framework in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Gong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> proposed two improvements: a ranking-based mutation operator of DE and a dynamic diversity mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Methods Based on the Preference of Feasible Solutions Over Infeasible Solutions</head><p>At present, some researchers focus mainly on how to design the search algorithms and the feasibility rule is directly employed or slightly revised to handle constraints. For example, Gordián-Rivera and Mezura-Montes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed an approach to combine three DE variants, in which the three DE variants compete to generate offspring based on two performance measures. Mezura-Montes and Lopez-Davila <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> designed an adaptive stepsize control and a local search operator, and put them into the modified bacterial foraging algorithm (BFOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Hernández-Ocaña et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> added four stepsize control mechanisms into the modified BFOA <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Elsayed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> carried out a series of work on combining multiple algorithms and/or multiple operators to tackle constrained search space, such as a self-adaptive multistrategy DE and an adaptive configuration of EAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Sarker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> developed a DE with dynamic parameter selection. In this method, three sets of parameters are considered: the first set is for the scaling factor F, the second is for the crossover control parameter CR, and the third is for the population size NP. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> developed a constrained artificial immune system based on immune response principle, in which the population is classified into the feasible and infeasible groups. Tuba and Bacanin <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> hybridized improved seeker optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> with firefly algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Sadollah et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> introduced a new metaheuristic algorithm, called the mine blast algorithm. Mohamed and Sabry <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> implemented several modifications on DE, including the mutation operator, F, and CR. Recently, Dhadwal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> proposed an advanced particle swarm assisted genetic algorithm.</p><p>The ε constrained method proposed by Takahama and Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> is another representative constrainthandling technique belonging to the methods based on the preference of feasible solutions over infeasible solutions. In 2012, Takahama and Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> selected different values of F and CR for each individual in DE according to the rank of the base vector, and proposed a rank-based εDE. In 2013, Takahama and Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> combined the ε constrained method with the estimated comparison using kernel regression. Recently, Bu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> implemented an improved version of εDEag <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> by utilizing the species-based repair strategy. Dominguez-Isidro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> proposed a memetic algorithm, in which DE is used as the global search algorithm and the local search is implemented by a mathematical programming method. In addition, the ε constrained method is applied to compare the individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Methods Based on Multiobjective Optimization</head><p>Currently, this kind of methods usually converts a COP into a biobjective optimization problem like ( f ( x), G( x)). After the above transformation, Dong and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> constructed the achievement scalarizing function <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F( x) = max{ω 1 ( f ( x) -z 1 ), ω 2 (G( x) -z 2 )} (7)</formula><p>where ω = (ω 1 , ω 2 ) is a weighting vector and z = (z 1 , z 2 ) is a reference point. They imposed preference to f ( x) and G( x) via different weighting vectors and reference points (i.e., a preference-based biobjective optimization). Jiao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> proposed a novel selection strategy. After combining the offspring population with the parent population, this selection strategy first eliminates the individuals with higher constraint violations than the maximum constraint violation of the last generation, and subsequently the nondominated individuals are chosen. Wang and Cai <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> presented a dynamic hybrid framework (DyHF), in which the global and local search models are dynamically implemented according to the feasibility proportion of the population. In the same year, Wang and Cai <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> proposed CMODE, which combines multiobjective optimization with DE. The above two methods adopts Pareto dominance to compare the individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Methods Based on Hybrid Constraint-Handling Techniques</head><p>Deb and Datta <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> proposed a hybrid evolutionary and penalty function method. This method first converts a COP into a biobjective optimization problem. Afterward, NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> is used to solve the converted problem and the nondominated front is applied to estimate the penalty coefficient. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, the main framework is inherited from <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, but the previous gradient-based approach is replaced with a gradient-free pattern search approach. Datta and Deb <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> studied on the scaling issue in constrained optimization and proposed an adaptive normalization technique for constraints. Subsequently, this technique is integrated with a hybrid method similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Cai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> introduced a novel memetic algorithm called IWO-DE. In IWO-DE, an adaptive fitness function is designed to determine the reproduction ability of each weed in IWO <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. If the population size of IWO reaches the permissible maximum, some worst individuals are removed by the nondominated sorting <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Later, Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> extended the above work by making use of a ring neighborhood topology as the population structure. Li and Yin <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> proposed a self-adaptive constrained artificial bee colony algorithm, in which the employed bee colony based on the feasibility rule is responsible for global search and the onlooker bee colony based on multiobjective optimization is treated as the local search model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PROPOSED APPROACH</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivation</head><p>Balancing constraints and objective function is a fundamental issue in constrained evolutionary optimization. The methods based on penalty functions attempt to address this issue by introducing appropriate penalty coefficients into the penalty term. In addition, the methods based on multiobjective optimization tend to strike a balance by converting a COP into a multiobjective optimization problem. However, in the methods based on the preference of feasible solutions over infeasible solutions, this issue has not been well studied. For example, despite the feasibility rule being the most popular constraint-handling technique during the last four years, more focus has been put on the search algorithms when using it to solve COPs as pointed out previously. The reason seems straightforward: the feasibility rule prefers constraints to objective function and may cause problems such as premature convergence, especially when solving complex COPs, and as a result, it is expected to design more powerful search algorithms to overcome its limitation to a certain degree. In principle, the feasibility rule is a relatively greedy constrainhandling technique. Note, however, that its greedy property also leads to some attracted advantages over other kinds of constraint-handling techniques, such as the capabilities to rapidly motivate the population toward the feasible region and to speed up the optimization in the promising directions.</p><p>In view of the fast but less reliable constraint-handling performance of the feasibility rule, a new method named FROFI is proposed which utilizes the information provided by objective function to alleviate the greediness and improve the robustness. Moreover, by incorporating the objective function information into the feasibility rule, FROFI can reach an effective balance between constraints and objective function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. FROFI</head><p>At each generation t, FROFI maintains as follows. 1) A population of NP individuals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P t = { x 1,t , . . . , x NP,t }.</formula><p>2) The objective function values of P t : f ( x 1,t ), . . . , f ( x NP,t ).</p><p>3) The degree of constraint violation of P t : G( x 1,t ), . . . , G( x NP,t ). COEAs include two main components, i.e., the constrainthandling technique and the search algorithm. Due to its numerous advantages, including simplicity, efficiency, and ease of implementation, DE has been utilized as the search algorithm in FROFI. The framework of FROFI has been given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. During the evolution, for each individual x i,t (also called a target vector) in P t , a trial vector u i,t is generated by making use of the mutation and crossover operators of DE. Afterward, x i,t is compared with u i,t based on the feasibility rule, and the better one is selected and put into the next population P t+1 . If u i,t cannot survive into P t+1 and if f ( u i,t ) &lt; f ( x i,t ), then u i,t will be stored into a predefined archive A. Under this condition, the properties of u i,t can be summarized as follows.</p><p>Theorem 1: u i,t is an infeasible individual. Proof: Assume that u i,t is a feasible individual. Since u i,t is worse than x i,t based on the feasibility rule, the following condition holds: x i,t is also a feasible individual and f ( x i,t ) &lt; f ( u i,t ). This is in contradiction to the fact that f ( u i,t ) &lt; f ( x i,t ).</p><p>After the update of P t+1 has been completed, the individuals in A are used to replace some individuals in P t+1 by a replacement mechanism. Subsequently, a mutation strategy is implemented. The above procedure is repeated until the maximum number of fitness evaluations (FEs) is reached. Next, we will explain the DE operators, the replacement mechanism, and the mutation strategy in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. DE Operators</head><p>In FROFI, two DE mutation operators introduced in Section II-A (i.e., DE/current-to-rand/1 and DE/rand-tobest/1) are adopted, each of which is applied with the same probability (i.e., 0.5) when producing the mutant vector v i,t for a target vector x i,t . In DE/current-to-rand/1, the current individual learns the information from other randomly chosen individuals. However, in DE/rand-to-best/1 the information of the best individual in the population is also utilized. In order to further improve the search performance, the first scaling factor in both of them is set to a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1. Note that after mutation, the binomial crossover of DE is only applied to DE/rand-tobest/1. DE/current-to-rand/1 without the binomial crossover is a rotation-invariant process and very effective for solving the rotated problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. The details of the DE mutation and crossover operators have been given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.  As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the best individual (i.e., x best,t ) in DE/rand-to-best/1 is determined according to objective function. The reasons are listed as follows.</p><p>1) At the early stage of evolution, the population may contain only infeasible solutions. Due to that fact that in this scenario the population should continuously approach the feasible region to find a feasible solution, the infeasible individual with the best objective function value may change from generation to generation in the evolutionary process. As a result, x best,t somehow likes a randomly selected individual. Under this condition, both DE/rand-to-best/1 and DE/current-to-rand/1 play a similar role, i.e., promoting the global exploration ability of the population. 2) At the middle and later stages of evolution, more and more individuals in the population become feasible. If a feasible individual has the best objective function value, then the population will be promptly guided toward this promising solution. On the other hand, if an infeasible individual near the feasible region has the best objective function value, it is very likely that the optimal solution is located on the boundary of the feasible region. In this case, by utilizing such infeasible individual, a lot of potential infeasible individuals may be generated near the feasible region, which provides an advantage to search for the optimal solution by surrounding the boundary of the feasible region from both the feasible and infeasible sides. A COP has been taken as an example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, where x * denotes the optimal solution located on the boundary of the feasible region and x ∧ denotes the infeasible individual with the best objective function value. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, some potential infeasible individuals near the feasible region (denoted as triangles) may be generated via making use of x ∧ . Based on the above discussion, it is beneficial to use the information provided by objective function to guide the search in DE. By doing this, the global search ability can be strengthened at the early stage and the local exploitation can be encouraged at the middle and later stages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Replacement Mechanism</head><p>The replacement mechanism aims at alleviating the greediness of the feasibility rule by replacing some individuals in the population with the individuals in the archive A.</p><p>In order to avoid the replacement occurrence only in a small area of the decision space, a simple way is proposed in which we divide the population into MRN parts with the same size, after sorting it based on the objective function values in descending order. This way can be regarded as a very simple and cheap niching technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> because the objective function values of the neighboring individuals may be very similar. Subsequently, we choose the individual with the maximum degree of constraint violation from the first part (denoted as x a ) and the individual with the minimum degree of constraint violation from A (denoted as x b ), respectively. If f ( x b ) &lt; f ( x a ), x b is stored into the population by replacing x a and then deleted from A.</p><p>Next, the individual with the maximum constraint violation value in the second part (also denoted as x a ) and the individual with the minimum constraint violation value in A (also denoted as x b ) are selected. Similarly, if f ( x b ) &lt; f ( x a ), x a is replaced with x b and x b is subsequently removed from A. The above process continues until all the MRN parts are updated or A becomes an empty set. Therefore, MRN determines the maximum replacement number. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the implementation of the replacement mechanism. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Mutation Strategy</head><p>The constraints of some COPs exhibit nonlinear and multimodal properties. As a result, if only the information of constraints is considered, the population will be easily trapped into a local optimum in the infeasible region and feasible solutions cannot be found when the iteration terminates. In this case, the objective function information may be useful for the population to jump out of a local optimal basin in the infeasible region.</p><p>Based on the above consideration, a simple mutation strategy is proposed. It is necessary to emphasize that this mutation strategy is only applied to the situation that all the individuals in the population are infeasible. First, let x c be an individual chosen from the population at random, x e , the individual with the maximum degree of constraint violation in the population, and k, an integer number randomly selected from <ref type="bibr">[1, D]</ref>. Then, a random number between L k and U k is assigned to the kth dimension of x c and thus a mutated individual is generated (denoted as x d ). Afterward, if f ( x d ) &lt; f ( x e ), x d will enter the population by replacing x e . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> presents the detailed explanations of the mutation strategy.</p><p>Remark: From the above introduction, the implementation of FROFI is simple and it does not impose any computationally expensive operations. The computational time complexity of FROFI is O(NP log(NP)), which is governed by the sorting in the replacement mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Analysis of the Principle</head><p>As introduced previously, the feasibility rule and multiobjective optimization are two kinds of popular constrainthandling techniques, and the aim of FROFI is to incorporate the objective function information into the feasibility rule. Indeed, the above three methods have a similarity, i.e., they treat the constraints and objective function separately. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> discusses the principles of the feasibility rule, multiobjective optimization, and FROFI when comparing a parent x i with an offspring u i . Note that Pareto dominance is used to compare x i and u i when a COP is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, if both x i and u i are feasible solutions, then all the above three methods put the importance of 100% on the objective function and the constraint violation can be ignored. However, if one of x i and u i is infeasible or both of them are infeasible, the feasibility rule lies on one extreme, i.e., minimizing the constraint violation is considered more important than minimizing the objective function. Meanwhile, multiobjective optimization lies on the other extreme, i.e., the constraint violation and objective function are of equal importance. Under this condition, FROFI first compares u i with x i based on the feasibility rule. Afterward, if u i is worse than x i in terms of the constraint violation and better than x i in terms of the objective function, u i will be stored into the archive and utilized in the subsequent evolution, which means that the constraint violation plays a primary role and the objective function plays an auxiliary role. Therefore, FROFI lies between the above two extremes, which is an advantage of FROFI in principle as compared to the feasibility rule and mutiobjective optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Proof-of-Principle Results</head><p>First, three artificial test functions are constructed to capture some important characteristics of introducing the objective function information into the feasibility rule in FROFI.</p><p>These test functions contain two decision variables, and consequently, are easy to visualize. In order to further compare FROFI with the feasibility rule and multiobjective optimization, two FROFI variants referred as FROFI_FR and FROFI_MO are designed. In FROFI_FR and FROFI_MO, the comparison of individuals is based on the feasibility rule and Pareto dominance, respectively. For both of them, the following two steps are implemented: 1) the archiving and replacement are removed from FROFI and 2) the mutation strategy is removed from FROFI. In addition, x best,t of DE/ rand-to-best/1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> represents the best individual in the population based on the feasibility rule for FROFI_FR, and one of the nondominated individuals in the population for FROFI_MO. Moreover, DE/current-to-rand/1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is kept unchanged for FROFI_FR and FROFI_MO.</p><p>The three artificial test functions have the following formulations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ATF1: minimize f ( x) = 2 i=1</formula><p>x 2 i -10 cos(2πx i ) + 10,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">-5 ≤ x 1 , x 2 ≤ 5 subject to: x 1 + 2 ≤ 0 -x 1 -3 ≤ 0 2x 1 + x 2 + 7 = 0 ATF2: minimize f ( x) = 2 i=1</formula><p>x 2 i -10 cos(2πx i ) + 10,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">-10 ≤ x 1 ≤ 5, -5 ≤ x 2 ≤ 5 subject to: 3(x 1 + 7) 2 + x 2 2 ≤ 0.3 or (x 1 + 8) 2 + (x 2 -3) 2 ≤ 2 ATF3: minimize f ( x) = 2 i=1 x 2 i -10 cos(2πx i ) + 10, -10 ≤ x 1 ≤ 5, -5 ≤ x 2 ≤ 5 subject to: 3(x 1 + 9) 2 + x 2 2 ≤ 2.</formula><p>It is evident that these three test functions have the same objective function, which is the Rastrigin function with 2-D <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. The search space, the contours of objective function, the feasible region, and the optimal solution of them have been presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. When solving these three test functions, the population size NP was set to 40 and other parameter settings were kept unchanged which will be specified in Section V-B. Moreover, FROFI, FROFI_FR, and FROFI_MO used the same initial population to ensure the comparison fair. Figs. 7-15 provide     1) As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, FROFI_FR approaches the feasible region of ATF1 from only one side along with the evolution. In contrast, FROFI is able to approach the feasible region of ATF1 from both sides as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. 2) From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>, FROFI_FR concentrates its search around the feasible area with a relatively larger size of ATF2 and runs the risk of getting stuck at a local feasible optimal solution. On the contrary, the search of FROFI is carried out around the two parts of the feasible region of ATF2 and finally the global optimal solution can be found as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>.</p><p>3) It is clear from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref> that FROFI_FR enters the feasible region of ATF3 with a very fast speed and all the individuals in the population promptly become feasible. Due to the lack of sufficient sampling in the area including the optimal solution, FROFI_FR is prone to converge to a local attraction basin of the feasible region. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15</ref>, a lot of effort has been made by FROFI on both the feasible and infeasible areas around the optimal solution, and as a result, FROFI succeeds in locating the optimal solution. As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a search bias toward the feasible region should be introduced into multiobjective optimization for locating feasible solutions of COPs. 5) Overall, by incorporating the objective function information into the feasibility rule, FROFI is capable of enhancing the diversity of the population and steering the population toward the feasible region from diverse directions (for instance ATF1 and ATF2). Moreover, it is an effective method to find the optimal solution located on the boundary of the feasible region from both feasible and infeasible parts (for instance ATF3). To summarize, the above experiments present detailed insights into why FROFI is able to overcome the weaknesses of the two extremes in the feasibility rule and multiobjective optimization. The experiment comparisons among FROFI, FROFI_FR, and FROFI_MO on the benchmark test functions introduced in Section V-B have been summarized in the supplemental file (Tables <ref type="table">S1-S3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Benchmark Test Functions and Parameter Settings</head><p>Next, we employed two sets of benchmark test functions to thoroughly evaluate the performance of FROFI and to compare FROFI with other state-of-the-art COEAs. The first set is the 24 benchmark test functions collected in IEEE CEC2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and the second set is the 18 benchmark test functions with 10-D and 30-D developed in IEEE CEC2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Note that the objective function of all the test functions should be minimized. The details of these test functions can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>In the experimental study of FROFI, the maximum number of FEs MaxFEs and the population size NP were given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. Note that a proper setting of the population size is related to the dimension of an optimization problem. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, for the 10-D test functions, a slightly smaller population size was adopted to make FROFI more efficient. In addition, 25 independent runs were performed for each test function and the tolerance value δ for equality constraints was set to 0.0001. It is necessary to point out that the settings of MaxFEs, the number of runs, and the tolerance value δ are based on the suggestions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and kept the same in all the compared methods. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, we established a scaling factor pool (i.e., F pool = [0.6, 0.8, 1.0]) and a crossover control parameter pool (i.e., CR pool = [0.1, 0.2, 1.0]) in DE. At each generation, we randomly chose a value from F pool for F and a value from CR pool for CR. Then, the mutation and crossover operators of DE were implemented based on the chosen F and CR values. FROFI introduces a maximum replacement number MRN in the replacement mechanism. In all simulations, MRN = max(5, D/2) which implies that when D &gt; 10, MRN = D/2, otherwise MRN = 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Experiments on the 24 Benchmark Test Functions Collected in IEEE CEC2006</head><p>For the 24 benchmark test functions (denoted as g01-g24) collected in IEEE CEC2006, the performance of FROFI was compared with that of five state-of-the-art methods: εDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, APF-GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, (μ + λ)-CDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, DyHF <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, and CMODE <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.

Therefore, this improved best known solution is used to compute the success condition for g17. Regarding g20, no feasible solution has been reported by the existing algorithms. Moreover, the decrease of constraint violation of an individual in the vicinity of the optimal solution will result in the increase of its objective function value.

The success rate is the percentage of successful runs, and the success performance is the mean number of FEs for successful runs by the success rate. The success rates resulting from the six compared methods are summarized in supplemental file (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>). As shown in supplemental file, εDE, APF-GA, (μ + λ)-CDE, DyHF, CMODE, and FROFI achieve 100% success rate on 22, 12, 21, 22, 22, and 23 test functions, In this regard, FROFI the most stable performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Discussion</head><p>In this section, additional experiments were carried out on the 18 benchmark test functions with 10-D and 30-D  from IEEE CEC2010. For all the experiments, 25 independent runs were executed and all the parameter settings were kept unchanged unless otherwise specified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Effectiveness of the Replacement Mechanism:</head><p>In FROFI, the external archive stores some infeasible solutions carrying valuable information of objective function. Moreover, such infeasible solutions have been reemployed through the replacement mechanism. We implemented a variant of FROFI, called FROFI_WoR, in which the replacement mechanism has been discarded. The average and standard deviation of the objective function values obtained from FROFI and FROFI_WoR have been given in the supplemental file (Tables <ref type="table">S10</ref> and<ref type="table">S11</ref>). As shown in the supplemental file (Tables <ref type="table">S10</ref> and<ref type="table">S11</ref>), when D = 10 and 30, FROFI performs better than FROFI_WoR on 12 and 15 test functions, respectively. However, FROFI_WoR outperforms FROFI only on two and one test function, respectively. Moreover, we can observe from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">IX</ref> that FROFI provides higher R+ values than R-values in all the cases and the p-values of all the cases are less than 0.05.</p><p>Based on the above comparison, one can conclude that the replacement mechanism does play a crucial role in FROFI.</p><p>2) Effectiveness of the Mutation Strategy: We also considered another variant of FROFI, called FROFI_WoM, in which the mutation strategy has been removed. Table X summarizes the experimental results of FROFI and FROFI_WoM for C11 with 10-D, C12 with 10-D, and C11 with 30-D, which means that FROFI and FROFI_WoM achieved quite similar performance on the remaining test functions. After a careful observation, we found that both C11 and C12 use the Ronsenbrock function <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> as the constraint. The global minimum of the Ronsenbrock function is inside a long, narrow, and parabolic shaped flat valley, and as a result, it is very difficult to find the global minimum. Due to the above property, when using the Ronsenbrock function as the constraint, it is not strange that some methods tend to converge to a local optimum in the infeasible region. For example, εDEag, SRS-εDEag, ECHT-DE, DyHF, and CMODE are incapable of consistently finding feasible solutions on C11 and C12 as shown in the supplemental file (Tables <ref type="table">S6-S9</ref>).</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">X</ref>, the feasible rate was taken as the performance indicator. From Table X, the feasible rate drastically decreases when implementing FROFI_WoM on C11 with 10-D, C12 with 10-D, and C11 with 30-D. One may be interested in why FROFI and FROFI_WoM show the similar performance on C12 with 30-D. This is not difficult to understand because the relatively bigger FEs (i.e., 6 × 10 5 FEs) has been specified.</p><p>The above comparison corroborates that the use of the objective function information in the mutation strategy is helpful for FROFI to avoid premature convergence in the complex constrained search space.</p><p>3) Sensitivity in Relation to the Parameter Associate With the Replacement Mechanism: FROFI introduces its own parameter (i.e., MRN) which determines the maximum replacement number in the replacement mechanism. To study how the performance of FROFI is sensitive to this parameter, we have tried different values of MRN. The performance analysis was performed via the multiple-problem Wilcoxon's test and the Friedman's test based on the mean objective function value.</p><p>According to our observation, FROFI is not sensitive to MRN on the 18 test functions with 10-D in IEEE CEC2010, and MRN can be set to a value in a large range. Therefore, we only reported the statistical test results for the 18 test functions with 30-D from IEEE CEC2010 in Tables XI and XII. For these test functions, we tested five different values MRN: 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. FROFI with the five values are denoted as FROFI_14, FROFI_15, FROFI_16, and FROFI_17, respectively. Note that FROFI_15 is equivalent to the original FROFI. The average and standard deviation of the objective function values resulting from the compared methods are reported in the supplemental file (Table <ref type="table">S12</ref>).</p><p>From Table XI, FROFI_13 suffers from performance degradation since the p-value is less than 0.05 when comparing FROFI_13 with FROFI_15. Moreover, FROFI_13 gets the worst ranking as shown in Table XII. On the other hand, it seems that FROFI_14, FROFI_15, FROFI_16, and FROFI_17 have similar overall performance. Thus, we could </p></div>

FROFI for Constrained Mechanical Design Optimization Problems</head><p>In the previous sections, the performance of FROFI has been assessed by benchmark test functions. One may be interested in the performance of FROFI in practical applications. To this end, three constrained mechanical design optimization problems introduced in [73] are adopted. We used the same maximum number of FEs as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> for these three optimization problems.</p><p>Table XIII summarizes the experimental results of ABC, TLBO, and FROFI. Note that the experimental results of ABC and TLBO were directly taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> for fair comparison. From Table XIII, it can be observed that FROFI provides better average results than the two competitors on these three optimization problems, which verifies the effectiveness of FROFI in the practical applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Is Our Idea Applicable to Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Problems?</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, NSGA-II has been integrated with a constraineddomination rule which is an extension of the feasibility rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs). In NSGA-II, the parent population P t and the offspring population Q t are sorted based on the constrained-domination rule, and then all the individuals in P t ∪ Q t are partitioned into several nondominated levels. Finally, the individuals in P t ∪ Q t are put into the next population P t+1 level by level.</p><p>In this paper, according to the characteristics of CMOPs, the objective function information has been incorporated into NSGA-II as follows: 1) the individuals in Q t are resorting based only on the objective functions and divided into several nondominated levels; 2) if some individuals in the best nondominated level have not been put into P t+1 , then they are stored into an archive; and 3) the individual with the minimum constraint violation in the archive (denoted as   Due to the limit of the paper length, only the OSY problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> is used to test the performance of NSGA-II and INSGA-II. In addition, the hypervolume (HV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> is considered as the performance metric. Note that the larger the HV value, the better the performance of an algorithm. From the experiments, the mean HV values obtained by NSGA-II and INSGA-II over 25 runs are 696.3069 and 712.9837, which suggests that the objective function information can also be applied to enhance the performance of NSGA-II for solving CMOPs. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">16</ref> exhibits the Pareto fronts resulting from NSGA-II and INSGA-II in a typical run. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">16</ref>, NSGA-II is very likely to miss some parts of the true Pareto front.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposes an alternative method to balance constraints and objective function in constrained evolutionary optimization, called FROFI. In FROFI, we utilize the information of objective function to alleviate the greediness and improve the robustness of the well-known feasibility rule by three processes, i.e., the DE operators, the replacement mechanism, and the mutation strategy. Moreover, the comparison of individuals is based on objective function in the replacement mechanism and the mutation strategy.</p><p>Experiments across two benchmark test sets from IEEE CEC2006 and IEEE CEC2010 show that:</p><p>1) the DE operators have the capability to balance the exploration and exploitation during the evolution; 2) the replacement mechanism increases the diversity of the infeasible population, and efficiently searches the optimal solution from both the feasible and infeasible areas when the population contains feasible solutions;</p><p>3) the mutation strategy is a promising way to deal with complicated constrained search space; 4) FROFI achieves better or at least highly competitive performance against other state-of-the-art COEAs. Moreover, the performance advantage of FROFI is more pronounced on high-dimensional test functions. In the future, it is interesting to design adaptive or self-adaptive replacement mechanism in FROFI for solving large-scale COPs.</p><p>The MATLAB source code of FROFI can be downloaded from Y.
