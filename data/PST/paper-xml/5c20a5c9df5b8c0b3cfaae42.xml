<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The ocean covers nearly two-thirds of the surface on the Earth, and there has been great interest in developing underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) to help us explore the ocean realm. A great deal of efforts have been devoted to it, and significant progress has been made since the beginning of 2000s. However, most of the networks are isolatedly developed currently, inherently hardware-based and application-oriented with inflexible closed-form architectures, which are difficult to reconfigure, reprogram and evolve. They also lack the capability in sharing resources, and are far from service-oriented networks. These limitations impair their capacity for wide range of applications. To further propel the development of UWSNs, next-generation UWSNs have been proposed recently, which are robust, flexible, adaptive, programmable, support resourcesharing feature and are easy to manage and evolve. Moreover, a number of novel software-defined techniques and paradigms, such as software-defined radio (SDR), cognitive acoustic radio (CAR), network function virtualization (NFV), software-defined networking (SDN), Internet of underwater things (IoUTs) and sensor-cloud, have been emerging. These software-defined technologies have the capability of softwarizing network resources, and then redefining them to satisfy diverse application requirements, improve resource utilization efficiency and simplify network management. Consequently, these evolving technologies are envisioned as critical building blocks and major driving forces, which will transform conventional UWSNs towards softwarebased, programmable, user-customizable and service-oriented next-generation UWSNs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing works on implementing these techniques, and also present discussions for future research. We hope to inspire more active research on these areas and take a step further towards realizing next-generation UWSNs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have been drawing attention of the research community since 2000, and significant advancements have been made in underwater modems, communication and network protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. However, the technologies have not been mature enough to be utilized broadly and meet diverse requirements of different applications. This is partly because of the constrained nature of resources, as well as inherent complexity of underwater communication channels. Consequently, extensive efforts have been devoted to tackle the problems of underwater communication systems by designing energy-efficient underwater sensor nodes (e.g., underwater acoustic modem) and communication system algorithms (e.g., MAC, network and application layers).</p><p>However, currently, most of the UWSNs are inherently hardware-based with inflexible, closed and rigid architectures, which are hard to reconfigure, reprogram and evolve <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Moreover, most of them are application-oriented and isolatedly developed, and so these networks lack the capability in sharing resources, supporting multi-application and are far from service-oriented networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Furthermore, new challenges are emerging which need to be tackled along with the development of UWSNs. For example, as UWSNs become larger, more heterogeneous underwater devices from different vendors are integrated into a single network, which require to improve interoperability feature of those assets to communicate with each other in a cooperative and seamless manner.</p><p>To further propel the development of UWSNs, nextgeneration UWSNs have been proposed recently, which are robust, flexible, adaptive with the ability to utilize energy and resources efficiently, and are easy to manage and evolve <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. To make such networks a reality, new fundamental insights and bold visions should be developed as well as novel paradigms and techniques should be applied to them. Recently, some software-defined techniques, such as softwaredefined radio (SDR), cognitive acoustic radio (CAR), network virtualization, software-defined networks, sensor-cloud have been emerging <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. These evolving technologies are envisioned as critical building blocks and major driving forces that lead to the transformation of traditional UWSNs towards software-based, programmable, user-customizable and serviceoriented UWSNs.</p><p>One core principle behind those software-defined technolo- gies is the capability to softwarize network resources and then redefine those resources according to the requirements of different applications, which essentially enhances the utilization of resources and improves the efficiency of network management. The softwarization process is realized by flexible and programmable UWSNs. Generally, the ongoing research in this context focuses on three different levels, which are node level, network level and application level. From the aspects of programmability, those techniques have different priorities and advantages that target on different protocol layers.</p><p>A sample underwater software-defined architecture is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In this architecture, SDR is integrated to software-defined underwater acoustic modem to enhance reconfigurability feature of both physical and MAC layers. On the other hand, cognitive radio (CR) is primarily used in order to exploit and utilize the dynamic characteristics of underwater spectrum. Software-defined networking (SDN) decouples the control logic of normal sensor nodes to the centralized controllers. Hence, higher layer functionalities are performed through well defined APIs to simplify network management <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. NFV virtualizes network resources into softwarized entities to improve the resource sharing feature of sensor networks. Both Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) and cloud computing (sensor-cloud) can be regarded as application level technologies, which enable application-oriented sensor networks towards sensing-as-a-service networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>So far, significant effort has been made to improve programmability feature at the node level in order to handle complex underwater channels and design effective communication systems. Generally, other software-defined technologies are still in their infancy stages that require further development. However, we advocate that these emerging and novel software-defined technologies are powerful enough to transform conventional networks towards next-generation UWSNs. Additionally, although most of these technologies are developed isolatedly, some of them are complementary to each other. Therefore, those techniques could be combined and integrated together that create mutually strengthened force to tackle inherent problems of UWSNs and further propel their development.</p><p>In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on existing research of underwater software-defined architectures and technologies, and highlight their potential advantages on further extension in underwater domain. Several research directions are also discussed with the hope to identify unexplored areas for further research. Although there exist a number of surveys that focus on different aspects of UWSNs (e.g., channel characteristics, MAC, routing, topology control, localization, optical communication, testbeds, deployment and application scenarios) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first effort to provide a complete overview on software-defined technologies across multiple layers (e.g., physical, MAC, network and application layers). Moreover, it is also the first paper to discuss the issues related to SDR, CR, network function virtualization (NFV), SDN, IoUTs and cloud computing (e.g., sensor-cloud) concepts for the design of software-defined programmable architecture. The primary goal of this paper is to inspire more active research on software-defined UWSNs, and make a step further towards next-generation UWSNs.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the requirements of next-generation UWSNs, and then briefly describe the general characteristics of UWSNs, the design considerations of UWSNs as well as the related literature in this context. In Section III, we present a review on SDR enabling technologies, including software-defined acoustic modem and software-defined cognitive networks. In Section IV, the issues related to software-defined networking (SDN)enabled UWSNs are presented. The network virtualization concept in UWSNs is discussed in Section V. In Section VI, the potential of IoUTs and cloud computing technologies in this arena are presented. A brief summary of software-defined techniques and the future research directions are discussed in Section VII. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section VIII.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES AND BACKGROUND</head><p>In this section, we lay out related background information of UWSNs. More specifically, we discuss the requirements of next-generation UWSNs, then briefly describe the main characteristics of UWSNs, the design considerations of UWSNs, and finally report on the relevant literature. The terms related to this paper are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Requirements of Next-Generation UWSNs</head><p>With the evolution of network technologies, a few papers discussed about next-generation UWSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We deem that next-generation UWSNs should be secure, reliable, efficient, robust, scalable, adaptable, evolvable and intelligent, a sample of which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Accordingly, to tackle inherent challenges of UWSNs and accelerate application development, the future UWSNs should have the following features.</p><p>-Flexibility and Adaptability: Traditional UWSNs are naturally hardware-based networks with rigid and inflexible architecture. However, to develop future service-oriented networks, these networks should provide reliable, user-customized and on-demand services to satisfy diverse and differentiated application requirements. Accordingly, in order to bring the network flexibility and adaptability features into reality, reprogrammable and reconfigurable architectures which are intelligent and agile enough to handle the dynamic and versatile communication environments, are required. Furthermore, the adaptable network should cope well with severely harsh communication environments as well as new requirements of applications in terms of differentiated QoS and security <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. To design a robust, scalable and intelligent network, it also requires that the network is equipped with flexible and adaptive features. For example, an adaptive network should guarantee the scalability, i.e., a network still performs efficiently even when it scales up to a very large-scale one. Similarly, the network flexibility should prevent degradation of network performance while encountering network variation (e.g., node failure, change of topology and intermittent communication channel).</p><p>-Efficient Network Management: As UWSNs are generally resource constrained systems with limited computational capacity, memory, bandwidth and energy supply, managing such networks efficiently is a difficult task. In addition to that, both the inherent characteristics of the rigid hardwarebased ad-hoc sensor networks and the harsh ocean communication environments make the implementation of simplified network management even more challenging. Moreover, since the management of UWSNs covers several aspects of the sensor network (e.g., network configuration, topology control, QoS control, energy and power control, security, network maintenance, and mobility), to achieve optimized management efficiency is also a complicated and challenging task <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>-Interoperability: Along with the development of UWSNs, a large number of heterogeneous assets (e.g., various underwater modems, AUVs, USVs, ROVs, gliders, fixed or mobile buoys, vessels, subsea or surface sensor nodes) need to be integrated, and be interoperated with each other to perform specific tasks in a cooperative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. However, these heterogeneous devices and equipment are produced by different manufacturers based on inherent, inflexible and closed architectures, which are difficult to interoperate with each other while maintaining cooperation.</p><p>The standardization of protocol stack greatly facilitates the interoperability of these devices, which can be achievable in physical layer or network layer. However, standardizing heterogeneous devices among different manufactures is a slow and very difficult process as different vendors are concerned about product safety and have fear about the disclosure of commercial information. Consequently, it is difficult to reach a feasible consensus among them. An alternative option is to standardize the network layer via novel emerging softwaredefined technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. For example, SDR can be integrated into the design of programmable underwater modems, in which the operational parameters, such as operating frequencies, modulation modes, can be reconfigured and reprogrammed at run-time to improve the interoperability of underwater devices.</p><p>-Multi-Modality: Conventional UWSNs mainly rely on lowdata-rate, long-range and high-delay acoustic links to transmit data and communicate with each other. With the advancement of emerging underwater communication technologies, such as optical and electromagnetic (EM), UWSNs have highdata-rate, short-distance and high-bandwidth complementary technologies to choose <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. By jointly exploiting favorable features of multi-modal communications, the network performance can be greatly improved in terms of diverse data rate, communication range, delay, throughput, reliability as well as network coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the available data rate and the maximum communication range are correlated with the operating frequencies of underwater acoustic modems. For example, at 24 kHz working frequency, the data transfer rate is about 4 kb/s for 2000 m communication range. Whereas, the data rate can reach up to 28 kb/s at 100 kHz working frequency, but the distance is decreased to about 100 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. This characteristic could also be used for multi-modal communication by endowing a single modem to operate at multiple frequencies.</p><p>-Multi-Application: UWSNs are typically composed of expensive hardware components, and hence the deployment and maintenance costs of the network are high. However, conventional UWSNs are application-oriented, the protocols of which are heavily dependent on physical hardware components. Hence, a network which is designed for a specific application usually cannot be used for another application. Consequently, multiple UWSNs are required to be deployed in the same area for different applications, which lead to under-utilization of resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. With the support of multiapplication design, a single well-designed network can support multiple applications by sharing the same physical infrastructure. For example, a deployed ocean monitoring network can also perform surveillance and tracking tasks in parallel (e.g., intrusion detection) in the same network.</p><p>-Sensing-as-a-Service: UWSNs are considered as the foundation of IoUTs, which aim to revolutionize the interaction among the submarine deployed smart devices and networks via the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The development of emerging technologies recently (e.g., IoUTs, cloud computing and N-FV) makes sensing-as-a-service or infrastructure-as-a-service possible in underwater domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. For example, IoUT aims to revolutionize interactions with submarine deployed smart devices and networks via the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The paradigm of sensing-as-a-service enables UWSNs to provide on-demand services for user-defined requests from anyplace anytime by sharing underlying resources. The network hardware resources are virtualized and abstracted, and so sensing-as-a-service also revolutionizes the traditional application-specific sensor networks to service-oriented sensor networks. To realize the paradigm of sensing-as-a-service and IoUTs, underwater devices need to be IP-compatible, be accessed via gateways or interfaces and be smoothly connected with the cloud architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>-Security: Security is one critical foundation stone of a reliable UWSN. Usually, this type of networks are inherently vulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. As these networks are operated in harsh ocean environments, both the unreliable wireless communication channels and the mobility of the network as well as all insecure protocols leave rooms and expose the network for attacks. Moreover, when UWSNs are deployed for military surveillance applications (e.g., intrusion detection, target tracking), the nature of which are prone to bring severe security threats and attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Underwater malicious attacks aim at different layers (e.g., physical-, MAC-, network-and transport layer) in the form of jamming attack, wormhole attack, sinkhole attack or flooding attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. These attacks either destroy sensor nodes or paralyze the entire network, which lead to degradation of network performance, disclosure of secret information or even network failure. Although security is a critical feature of UWSNs, it has not been paid enough attention. The architectural design of next-generation UWSNs should put more emphasis on network security, and leverage emerging software-defined technologies to create effective counteracting measures that improve network security.</p><p>-Network Evolvability: Evolvability is a critical feature for the adaptive evolution of networks. However, as most of the existing UWSNs have inflexible hardware-dependent architecture, they lack network evolvability for further innovation and improvement once these networks have been deployed. Therefore, when new technologies as well as new network control and management solutions appear, it becomes difficult to introduce and execute them in a deployed network. On the contrary, in evolvable networks, new communication technologies as well as novel control management policies can be adopted, deployed, upgraded easily and quickly after their initial deployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>To enhance network evolvability, new protocols or solutions should be tested thoroughly via simulation or experimental testbeds before real deployment to identify potential problems and eradicate errors as well as verify protocol functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. However, these experimental testbeds also have limitations compared to real field-level deployment scenarios. Hence, with the emerging network virtualization technologies, isolating unique network resource entities to verify these new protocols or solutions under real environments, will greatly facilitate the innovation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Characteristics of UWSNs</head><p>UWSNs have unique characteristics as they are deployed in harsh underwater environments. More specifically, we lay out the primary characteristics in terms of applications, communication technologies, deployment architectures, network communication devices and software protocols, the description of each is given as follows.</p><p>1) UWSN Applications: UWSNs can be applied to a broad range of applications, which can roughly be classified in terms of environment monitoring, exploration, disaster prevention, assisted navigation and maritime military applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In environment monitoring, the capability of remote sensing enables real-time ocean and water quality monitoring (e.g., temperature, electrical conductivity, ammonium nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, salinity, bacterial and pollution materials) feature.</p><p>Other underwater monitoring applications can protect harbor, coastline and commercial products/facilities (e.g., oil rig platforms, hydroelectric equipment and fisheries). For example, UWSNs can be used for monitoring the health of underwater assets (e.g., submarine pipelines of oil, gas or water and communication cables), exploring the biological ecosystems of the deep ocean and sea bed as well as investigating marine life (e.g., fish, underwater animals and coral reef), detecting underwater natural resources of seabeds (e.g., oil and minerals), monitoring disaster activities continuously to establish early warning systems (e.g., volcano, earthquake, tsunami and flood), and exploring and mapping the ocean seabed floor.</p><p>UWSNs can be used for assisted navigation while traveling via ships, boats, vessels, AUVs or even divers, especially in complex underwater environments. As sensors are deployed in dangerous navigation areas, when vessels or vehicles pass these areas, sensors can communicate and guard them successfully to get through those dangerous areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>The efforts of incorporating UWSNs into maritime military operations have significantly propelled the development of UWSNs. For example, the most well-known underwater maritime network Seaweb can be traced back to 1995, which was primarily designed for the applications of US Navy <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. As abundant ocean environment information (e.g., ocean temperature, electrical conductivity, salinity, turbidity, waves, currents and tides) greatly enhance naval warfare information capabilities in terms of command, communication and control, UWSNs can be operated as distributed autonomous monitoring systems that can provide real-time monitoring information of the ocean warfare region <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>UWSNs can also be deployed in the targeted area as a tactical surveillance system to detect and track sea surface, subsurface intruders, submarines as well as mines <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. In these surveillance networks, in addition to fixed underwater sensors, unmanned autonomous vehicles can communicate collaboratively to build underwater mobile sensor networks in order to execute more complex surveillance or target tracking missions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Apart from these traditional military missions of UWSNs, in the future naval war, the weaponized unmanned underwater vehicles can even automatically construct a swarm weapon system to carry out predefined military attack operations in a cooperative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>2) Underwater Wireless Communication Technologies: The harsh underwater environment poses a great challenge when developing underwater communication systems in spatially and temporally varying propagation media <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Currently, there are several underwater wireless communication technologies (e.g., acoustic, optical and EM), which can be applied to UWSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Although each of these technologies has their pros and cons, these technologies can be combined together to fully exploit their potentials. In the following, we illustrate some characteristics of each technology, and the main characteristics of the complementary communication technologies are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>.</p><p>-Underwater Acoustic Communication: The acoustic communication is the primary technique used in underwater communication systems currently, which has many unique characteristics (e.g., low transmission speed, high delay, limited bandwidth, low data rate, worse multi-path effect, worse doppler spread, noisy environment, high bit error rate (BER) and high spatially and temporally varying channel). Although acoustic waves have the advantage of long transmission range in water, its propagation velocity is extremely slow, which is approximately 1500 m/s in the ocean <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Consequently, acoustic communication has a high propagation delay (about 0.67 s/km), which is five orders of magnitude higher than terrestrial RF communication.</p><p>Even worse, the acoustic speed is not constant but varies with ocean temperature, salinity and pressure, which lead to a variable sound propagation delay. Hence, underwater acoustic communication experiences high and variable propagation delay, and spatially and temporally varying channel. Underwater acoustic channel also suffers intermittent connectivity, i.e., the communication path is temporarily lost due to ocean turbulence, currents, or movement of sensor nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Moreover, underwater acoustic channel has a limited bandwidth and low data rate as the absorption of sound propagation is severely dependent on both acoustic signal frequency and transmission distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Since high frequency suffers greater attenuations than low frequency, the optimal frequency range for kilometre-range transmission is narrowed to below one hundred kHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>The spatially varying speed of sound, which is mostly related to depth, gives rise to refractions of acoustic signal (in shallow water, between ocean surfaces and sea bed). Consequently, it results in multiple propagation paths between the source point to the receiver point with varying delays. Doppler spread arises from both the slow speed of sound and the fluctuations of path length of signal transmission, which is caused either by the movement of sensors (e.g., AUVs and UUVs) or by the fluctuations of sound that scatter sea surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Underwater acoustic environment is also noisy especially in shallow waters. The sources of ambient noise include natural and man-made noise, such as bubbles, tides, rain, storms, ships, marine animals, ocean plant machinery operations, offshore drilling, etc. The overall noise level is generally frequency-dependent which should be considered when choosing operating frequency for acoustic modems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>-Underwater Optical Communication: As optical technology on light-emitting node (LED) has been greatly advanced recently, more attentions are paid to develop a high bandwidth underwater wireless communication technique, which is considered as a complementary solution to mitigate the limitations of traditional acoustic communication. Therefore, it can be used for short-range, high data-rate tasks such as real-time video transmission or short-term bulk data retrieval. Overall, with this technology, the communication range is within one hundred meters, but transmission delay is very low and the data transfer rate can reach several tens to several hundreds Mbps or even Gbps <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>Underwater optical communication is affected by turbidity of ocean, light scattering and background ambient light noise. Moreover, the optical communication requires a line-of-sight link to operate in point-to-point style, i.e., two communication nodes need to be precisely aligned. This is because the communication light has narrow divergence angles, and thus produces optical beams with high directivity. However, the misalignment of optical communication is unavoidable, especially with mobile sensor nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. To reduce the requirement of strict alignment, the scattering property of light diffusion at the receiver side can be utilized. Another method is to design quasi-or omni-directional optical front-end to improve alignment efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p><p>Currently, several commercialized underwater optical modems are available. For example, BlueComm 200 is capable of transmitting high speed data ranging from 2.5 to 12.5 Mbps, and the transmission range is up to 150 m in moderate to low turbidity dark water environments. Another type of modem BlueComm 5000 has higher data rate which can reach up to 500 Mbps but with a maximum communication range at 7 meters <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>-Underwater EM Communication: As the maximum attainable data rates of acoustic communication are limited between tens of kbps to hundreds of kbps <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, both EM and optical communications are envisioned as complementary technologies that compensate the weakness of acoustic communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Generally, EM is suitable for short-range communications with high data transmission rates ranging from several Mbps to tens of Mbps <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. EM communication has several advantages compared to acoustic communicating systems, such as immunity to acoustic noise and bubbles, being unaffected by water depth and turbidity and non-lineof-sight communication. In addition to these, EM waves can communicate across boundaries (e.g., water-to-air, airto-water, water-to-seabed and seabed-to-water) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. These unique characteristics can be used for interesting applications. For example, submerged sensor nodes can communicate with surface sink nodes, or shore sink nodes directly, or can collect sensed data from the submerged sensors directly using near ocean surface UAVs.</p><p>EM technology also has a property of multi-path communication even through seabed, which makes it suitable to operate  Non-line-of-sight, cross boundary communications near the shore and sea floor. This feature can be used to construct wireless navigation assistant systems to guide AUVs or ROVs to expected sites based on the gradient magnitude of EM signal, e.g., the docking sites for recharging or high speed data retrieval. A major drawback of this technology is that it requires relatively bulky antennas, and hence it is susceptible to EM interference.</p><p>3) Deployment Architectures: UWSNs are deployed in the oceans, rivers, lakes or even fish ponds. Depending on specific applications, the versatile architectures of UWSNs can be categorized into a variety of types (e.g., static or mobile networks, two-dimensional or three-dimensional networks, seabed or surface networks and hybrid deployed networks). We briefly describe them as follows.</p><p>-Static Deployment: The static networks can be deployed on the surface of the ocean or near the sea floor on sea-bed. These can be deployed based on 2-D or 3-D architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>-Mobile Deployment: Mobile networks can be deployed in the ocean with AUVs, UUVs, or ROVs based on 3-D architecture. They also can be deployed on the ocean surface moved with ocean currents, or with USVs on the sea surface based on 2-D architecture.</p><p>-Hybrid Deployment: Aside from static or mobile networks, complex heterogeneous underwater networks can be deployed both on the sea surface, in the ocean space and on the seabed. The sensors in the network can be static or mobile, or even with AUVs, UUVs, ROVs and underwater gliders <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. The heterogeneous devices should be operated cooperatively to perform sophisticated tasks (e.g., maritime military surveillance and monitoring).</p><p>4) Communication Devices and Software Protocols: Underwater communication devices and equipment are expensive. Moreover, both the deployment and maintenance costs are very high. One sensor node usually includes a variety of sensors and a single or multi-modal communication technologies (e.g., acoustic, optical or EM). Static nodes usually use mooring line to anchor the nodes to the seabed. On the sea surface, sensor nodes can be mounted on floating buoys. Mobile sensors take the form of AUVs, UUVs, ROVs or free drifting nodes with ocean currents. As underwater devices are operated in harsh ocean environments, they are prone to failures, fouling and corrosion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Underwater devices are usually with limited battery power and it is usually difficult to change or recharge their batteries. Consequently, energy efficiency is a critical metric in the design of network protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Mobile nodes, such as AUVs, UUVs, and ROVs, may have solar-powered rechargeable battery that allow those devices to operate silently underwater for months.</p><p>Generally, the traditional software protocol stack in an underwater communication device consists of a number of basic layers (e.g., physical, MAC (data link), network, transport and application) and other management control components (e.g., energy, power, localization, time synchronization, mobility and security) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In UWSNs, the physical layer may have different hardware front-ends (e.g., acoustic, optical and EM), which are responsible for successful transmission and reception of underwater communication modulated signals. The function of the data link layer is the reliable data transfer, which includes both the medium access control (MAC) and error control <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The network layer is responsible for discovering and maintaining routes between a source and a destination node <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The transport layer is primarily for underwater flow congestion control and reliable data collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The application layer performs various application-specific tasks by utilizing sensed data as well as the underlying physical infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Design Considerations of UWSNs</head><p>While designing UWSNs protocols, the developers should try to achieve several design objectives in terms of multiple network performance metrics as well as multiple network features as described in Section II-A. However, to develop a practical underwater communication system, three major characteristics should be kept in mind: resource constraints, complex communication environments and application diversity, as they are the key factors which influence the design of underwater protocols. Hence, although we would take all these metrics into account when designing UWSNs protocols and try our best to obtain optimized network performance, we need to tackle more real-world challenges in the design process. Consequently, under specific scenarios, it may be difficult to obtain an optimized solution that satisfies all these metrics. As these metrics can be grouped into low-level fundamental metrics (e.g., secure, reliable, efficient, robust and scalable), and high-level metrics (e.g., adaptable, evolvable and intelligent), protocol design should satisfy the low-level metrics at first. Furthermore, as there is no protocol which is suitable for all application scenarios and different applications may assign different priorities among these metrics, it is inevitable to make tradeoffs among these metrics under certain circumstances. For example, military applications may require higher priority on security compared to the ocean environment monitoring applications.</p><p>To design the architecture of a novel protocol stack for UWSNs, we need node-level, network-level and applicationlevel technologies, and should carefully consider those across multiple layers from the physical layer to the application layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Furthermore, multiple layers in the protocol stack may need to work together in order to obtain desired network performances. For example, to satisfy network reliability in terms of reliable data transfer, different strategies in multiple layers may need to work in a cooperative manner to reach that goal.</p><p>As addressing multi-layer dependent tasks in each related layer isolatedly may result in solutions with inner conflicts which lead to the degradation of overall network performance, cross-layer design is a popular approach to deal with such problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Accordingly, it requires more efforts to tackle emerging challenges of implementing cross-layer design. In addition to these basic protocol layers, other management control components, such as energy, localization, time synchronization, mobility, security and so on, are inseparable parts of the underwater communication system which need to be considered together carefully <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Utilizing software-defined technologies (e.g., SDR, CR, SDN, NFV and sensor-cloud) help designers achieve numerous network performance metrics, such as reliability, flexibility, adaptability, interoperability and evolvability. However, while adopting these available software-defined technologies, we should carefully consider the challenges of integrating these complementary technologies into a single communication system. Furthermore, although these software-defined technologies have different priorities, the overall programmability of the designed protocols should focus on satisfying required network performance metrics.</p><p>As deploying UWSNs is generally associated with high cost in terms of hardware equipment, personnel and risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, the designers may need simulation, emulation and fieldlevel experimentation platforms to assist the development of underwater communication systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Via these welldesigned tools and platforms, the designers can conduct simulations, emulations and field experiments to validate, debug and test novel network protocols during different design phases before deploying applications in a real operating environment. This not only greatly reduces the cost of protocol development, but also shortens the system design time especially by applying integrated experimental platforms which support seamless transition from simulation, emulation to field-level testing via UnetStack, DESERT and SUNSET <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p></div>

A few papers reviewed the gradual development of virtualization concept in terrestrial wireless sensor networks (WSNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, the potential architectures of WSNs from the perspective of virtualization and their challenges are reviewed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. UNDERWATER SDR</head><p>A. Brief Overview of SDR and CR -Software-Defined Radio (SDR): In a traditional terrestrial radio system, most of its components are typically implemented in hardware (e.g., filters, modulators, demodulators and converters). Generally, these analogy modules are extremely optimized for specific applications, and hence they are hard to be changed and reconfigured <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. To make these conventional systems more flexible and reconfigurable, on 1993, the SDR concept was first described in a published paper by Joe Mitola <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>, which enables a novel paradigm shifted from inflexible hardware-based platform to reconfigurable, adaptive softwarebased architecture by replacing most of the wireless transceiver functions with software implementations in order to achieve unified RF communications and support multiple applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>.</p><p>A sample architecture of SDR is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. SDR substitutes inflexible hardware with programmable and reconfigurable software-base hardware. Except for antenna, RF hardware, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and digital-toanalog converter (DAC), all other parts (e.g., base band signal processing) are implemented in flexible digital programmingbased software that run on processors, which are easier to execute or switch between different modulation or protocol schemes in a real-time adaptative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>.</p><p>The goal of SDR is to increase system flexibility by moving ADC/DAC closer to the antenna in order to enhance the system with more programmable features <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Accordingly, most of the tasks are shifted from traditional hardware to programmable platforms, which adopt software-reconfigurable heterogeneous digital processing unit (e.g., DSPs, GPPs and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. With these programmable flexible platforms, designers are able to control the hardware, and build novel intelligent environment selfadaptive devices by configuring system parameters, such as signal bandwidth, amplitude, carrier frequency, modulation, data rate even at run-time immediately when necessary.</p><p>-Cognitive Radio (CR): One concept tightly related to SDR is CR, which can be regarded as a refined extension of SDR <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. The goal of CR is to exploit available communication resources fully by sensing environment continuously, and then reacting intelligently (e.g., transmission power selection, carrier-frequency selection and modulation scheme selection) through near-optimal decisions. A sample architecture of CR is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Generally, several components are associated with CR, which are for sensing, analyzing, learning, decision and adaptation operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. Therefore, CR is also considered as an intelligent autonomous unit that combines both SDR and a cognitive engine, together of which enable sensor nodes to have the capability of sensing communication environments, learning their changes and then reacting upon their learned results and intelligent decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. For example, a typical RF front-end, implemented in SDR, needs to sense and sample the communication channel firstly and then to choose suitable modulation scheme or a set of configuration parameters instantaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Potential Benefits of Applying SDR to UWSNs</head><p>The principles of both SDR and CR can be applied to underwater networks to increase node-level programmability in terms of flexibility, adaptability, reconfigurability and agile cognitivity. Jones was probably among the first advocates to discuss how to extend and adapt those techniques to the underwater network domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, SDR is proposed to be implemented in its OF-sensors via general-purpose singleboard computers in order to exploit the functionalities of GNU radio software package at physical-and MAC layer to optimize networking performance. In the case of underwater communication systems, the basic architecture of SDR and CR are as same as that of terrestrial RF systems by replacing RF antenna with underwater communication modems (e.g., acoustic, optical or EM).</p><p>Generally, these techniques can be used in UWSNs in two ways. One is to design self-adaptive reconfigurable underwater SDM. The other way is to design underwater cognitive networks with the advanced underwater spectrum management features <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. When SDR is incorporated to UWSNs, several benefits can be derived from these novel paradigms, which are summarized as follows.</p><p>-Adaptability and Flexibility: One primary goal of underwater software-defined devices is to increase their adaptability and flexibility to cope with the complex and rapidly changing underwater communication environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The SDR paradigm enables underwater acoustic modems as selfadaptable and cognitive programming devices by reconfiguring its hardware communication parameters, switching between different operational modes or communication techniques and selecting from different transmit power levels.</p><p>Accordingly, these programmable devices not only satisfy different application requirements dynamically, but are able to make real-time intelligent decisions adaptively to spatially and temporally varying underwater communication environments in order to achieve optimized performance. Since there does not exist a typical and common underwater communication environment, a designed communication system may work perfectively in one environment but may not work well in another operating environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Consequently, adaptability and flexibility features help the systems operate effectively with different deployment environments.</p><p>-Interoperability: SDR is the node-level software-defined technique, which aims to realize programmable and reconfigurable physical-and MAC layer. Therefore, SDR offers better opportunities for designers to resolve interoperability among different off-the-shelf modems made by different vendors, which have closed architecture and communication stacks. Leveraging SDR-based programmable and reconfigurable underwater modem, high level protocols (e.g., network-and application layer) can reconfigure network parameters (e.g., operating frequencies and modulation schemes) freely at realtime, and can adjust the degree of interoperability to enhance the cooperation of sensor nodes dynamically.</p><p>-Rapid Prototyping: Leveraging SDR, most of the traditional functionalities (e.g., signal detection, error correction, modulation and demodulation) of hardware-based modems can be replaced by software-based implementation. Thereby, SDR provides a great support for researchers to conveniently and easily construct versatile programmable and reconfigurable rapid prototyping experimental platforms suitable for various scenarios, which can be used to test and verify novel protocols in relatively low cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>-Cognitive Spectrum Utilization: Underwater acoustic communication spectrum has several unique features such as scarcity, heavily shared with both ocean animals or other underwater communication systems. With CR, underwater communication devices have the capability to re-program and reconfigure physical-and link layer. More importantly, it also has a cognitive engine which enables devices to tackle more complex tasks such as dynamic spectrum management in order to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization.</p><p>-Easy Update: In a SDR-based underwater device, major traditional hardware-based components are replaced by programmable software. This characteristic of the SDR-based devices makes it easier to upgrade them with newly developed algorithms via software update to improve network performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>.</p><p>-Intelligent Node: The architecture equipped with both SDR and CR perfectly integrates the operations related to sensing, decision making and action together. As a consequence, underwater sensor nodes evolve towards intelligent nodes. Such intelligent underwater devices are highly adaptive with their operating environments, and hence can perform complex tasks intelligently. Apart from that, the cognitive engine equips a node with learning ability, i.e., to learn from the continuous interactions with varying environments and differentiated application requirements through the process of analysis, summarization and adjustment. With the huge advancements of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years, the cognitive engine is incorporated with AI-based algorithms (e.g., machine learning, reinforcement learning as well as deep learning) to enhance node intelligence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Typical SDR Platform of USRP/GNU Radio</head><p>Although there are several commercial SDR platforms available for radio frequency (RF) research currently, the free open source GNU radio and open hardware platform front-end USRP demonstrated huge potential in terms of convenience to researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. Generally, a typical SDR platform may need a powerful host PC to conduct digital baseband processing tasks via signal processing software libraries or tools such as GNU Radio, LabVIEW, MATLAB/Simulink and so on. In such a SDR platform, USRP acts as a radio front-end receiving or transmitting signals for its ADC or DAC modules, which is connected with the host personal computer (PC) and its software tools.</p><p>-GNU Radio <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>: An open-source software development toolkit, called GNU Radio, is one of the most popular SDR frameworks. It has a comprehensive library for hardware-independent modulation schemes and signal processing modular-based blocks written in C and C++ (e.g., modulators, amplifiers and filters) <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. In GNU Radio, a visualization flowgraph tool, which is implemented in Python, is used to connect different basic building blocks via continuous stream of flows. Accordingly, designers are also allowed to create new user-defined signal processing blocks using those primitive basic blocks in the library, and then add them into the existing library to build or verify novel complex radio systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>-USRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>: The pure software tool GNU radio requires minimal RF front-end hardware to build real-world SDR systems. Developed by Ettus Research and National Instruments, USRP is one popular inexpensive complementary reconfigurable hardware, which is coupled with GNU Radio closely. USRP is composed of a mother board and a range of daughterboards. The mother board, which contains ADC, DAC, FPGA and so on, is connected to a host computer that runs the GNU Radio. The daughter boards operating in various frequency bands serve as the RF front-ends to receive or transmit radio waves. Currently, USRP has four different types for different operations, such as Bus series, Network series, Embedded series and X series <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. Note that, the Embedded series are especially designed for portable and battery operated outdoor embedded systems, which can be deployed on a Xinlinx Zynq SOC including an ARM microcontroller.</p><p>-USRP/GNU Radio Structure: Just as in the research area of terrestrial RF, USRP is also deeply integrated to GNU Radio in order to adapt to underwater channels, which is the most popular software-defined modem platform for its openness as well as free access <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. Typically, it is hard to run SDR on embedded systems because of the computational complexity (e.g., GNU radio/USRP 210), which usually requires a host PC to run on <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. However, the advancement of the technology makes them portable stand-alone SDR platforms currently without requiring a host PC to run on (e.g., USRP E310 does not need a host computer) <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>.</p><p>Since most of the commercial SDR platforms are designed to satisfy the requirements of RF terrestrial communications, when adapting those platforms to underwater domain, researchers should resolve several challenges. For example, most of the underwater acoustic modem frequencies are confined to less than a hundred kHz, whereas several commercial SDR platforms have limited frequency range which is not suitable for underwater research (e.g., the frequency range of USRP E310 is from 70 MHz to 6 GHz) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Although the frontend provides frequency bandwidth from DC to 30 MHz after adding a daughter board in USRP, which can be used for underwater research, the lack of power amplifier leads to limited experimental communication range <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Software-Defined Modem (SDM)</head><p>Underwater acoustic modems are the major components of UWSNs, and the essential parts of underwater sensor nodes or underwater mobile devices, which integrate sensing, data transceiving and even moving functionalities together. The acoustic modems are responsible for network communication, such as receiving or transmitting data in a wireless manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. The ongoing underwater network research is tightly dependent on two types of modems, which could be classified into two groups. One group focuses on developing MAC-, network-, or application layer protocols based on available commercial modems, while the other group concentrates on developing new experimental modems and relevant protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Currently, commercially available underwater modems are equipped with fixed hardware and proprietary closed software, and hence most of them are hard to modify and reconfigure. On the contrary, as SDR exhibits favorable characteristics in controlling fixed hardware, researchers extend the paradigm into SDM to design user-programmable, softwarereconfigurable intelligent hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, with these software-defined programmable hardware, designers are able to address the challenging underwater communication channel by modifying hardware parameters in the physical layer (e.g., signal processing chain, error correction codes, modulation or demodulation), MAC layer, or even in network layer (e.g., algorithms or protocols), in order to obtain optimal communication performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>.</p><p>Driven by the demand of more reliable, reprogrammable and reconfigurable underwater acoustic modems, a great deal of research efforts have been dedicated to the development of SDMs. In this section, we select typical SDMs including both research-oriented and off-the-shelf commercial modems to highlight the development history and other functional features in this domain, as depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>. Although there are many software-defined underwater acoustic modems <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>, limited by our paper, we select 13 typical modems to illustrate. For more detailed information of software-defined modems, please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</p><p>1) Hardware and Software Framework: SDM operates through both software and programmable hardware, in which some typical hardware functionalities (e.g., mixers, filters, amplifiers, detectors, modulators and demodulators) are implemented in software that run on a PC or an embedded system. When we choose acoustic software and hardware to build communication systems, we need to consider the following features.</p><p>-Energy Consumption: Energy efficiency is a critical metric of underwater modems as they are operated with limited energy supply. Integrating low-power physical mechanisms into the design of modems enhances energy efficiency. For example, by enabling sleep/wake-up mode in modems, idletime power management techniques could be used to save energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. In addition to that, when choosing suitable reconfigurable hardware, we may consider tradeoffs among several metrics (e.g., energy consumption, computation capacity, latency, memory size, weight, package size, cost, rapid prototyping and reconfigurability) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Currently, the digital processing platforms include ASICs, microcontroller, DSPs, FPGAs, GPPs and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>, energy consumption among microcontroller, DSP and FPGA is compared, which confirms the benefits of energy efficiency with reconfigurable hardware.</p><p>-Reconfigurability/Programmability and Adaptability: The aspiration for reconfigurable and programmable underwater communication devices is to enhance network adaptability in order to deal with dynamic environments and satisfy various requirements of applications and test scenarios. Therefore, accessibility and reconfigurability are fundamental properties of SDMs. SDM is implemented in programmable architecture in order to provide reconfigurable and re-programmable framework that facilitates scientific underwater network research. Besides, SDM can be an intelligent cognitive device with realtime reconfigurability and adaptability (in accordance with environments) features.</p><p>-Higher-Layer Integration and Cross-Layer Design: The depth of reprogramming feature varies from modem to modem <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>. Some modems provide limited reconfigurability option only at the physical layer, while some provide the reconfigurability option in both the physical and MAC layers. For example, rModem and UANT provide the flexibility for high-level software to utilize low-level physical-and MAC layer information. Depending on the reconfigurable modem, some software-defined reconfigurable and flexible platforms are designed in favor of cross-layer paradigms that integrate lower and higher layers, e.g., PHY-, MAC-, network-and application layer.</p><p>2) Brief Review of Research-Oriented Reconfigurable Modems: The research-oriented software-defined reconfigurable modems are mainly developed by universities and underwater research centers. Most of them are research prototypes although several approaches of which are adopted or integrated into commercial modems. In the following, we highlight the reconfigurability and programmability features of the selected modems, and reveal the development history of SDMs.</p><p>The implementation of reconfigurability and programmability features can be manual or automatic based on different requirements (e.g., experiments and applications). The early developed modems have limited reconfigurability and programmability features. As the hardware and software technologies have been greatly advanced, cognitive modems and platforms have appeared. These new modems integrate emerging techniques, such as SDR and CR, to provide realtime reconfiguration via the sensing, analyzing and decision-making processes. Among the selected modems, UNET-2, SeaNet and NILUS are the first endeavors to design real-time reconfigurable and programmable cognitive modems. a) rModem: rModem is a rapid prototyping research tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>. Its programmability feature focuses on physical layer, and it provides a JAVA-based graphical user interface (GUI) to program its hardware. Via its programmable hardware FPGA interface, the operating carrier frequency can be changed from 1 kHz to 100 kHz. The size of packets can also be changed by researchers via the GUI. It also supports simulation via Simulink that is coupled with the toolbox in MathWorks.</p><p>b) UANT: UANT is a software-defined acoustic research prototyping platform that takes USRP/GNU radio architecture, and it is probably the first open-source software-defined framework which provides programmability and reconfigurability features for both the physical and MAC layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. UANT adapts TinyOS into its system to implement MAC layer functionalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. Researchers can program the softwaredefined hardware with several reconfiguration options on both the physical and MAC layers. Via configurable programming, the data rate can be varied from 244 bps to 500 kpbs. Researchers can select center frequency from 0.1 Hz to 175 kHz. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>, the scholars tested basic Aloha protocols in their platform equipped with TinyOS, and showed that the MAC layer parameters such as backoff intervals can be reconfigured. UANT also integrates TOSSIM and Linux operating system (OS) to verify and monitor application performance by reconfiguring and tuning physical and MAC layer parameters. c) UW-Buffalo: UW-Buffalo is developed by University of New York at Buffalo, and the software-defined framework is based on a commercial Teledyne Benthos modem (e.g., Telesonar SM-75) <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. Although the original SM-75 version lacks the reconfigurability feature from the perspective of end-users, Teledyne Benthos modem provides a network application programming interface (API), called MMP, that allows researchers to implement new user-defined MAC and networking protocols to bypass the original inflexible hardcoded bond in the modem.</p><p>More importantly, MMP also provides a path to access and monitor the status of physical and logical link control (LLC) layers, as well as to control and reconfigure the modem. UW-Buffalo leverages MMP to modify the original modem by integrating Gumstix processor into it that enables a softwaredefined reconfigurable acoustic framework. Via Gumstix processor, UW-Buffalo also designs a XLC module to facilitate cross-layer design by monitoring and storing the physical and link layer status information (e.g., packet acquisition time, perceived signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), packet error rate, contention on the channel and transmission range).</p><p>UW-Buffalo provides reconfigurability option via physical and data link layer adaptive control, such as setting the maximum number of RTS attempts, enabling positive acknowledgement, controlling acoustic data rate, configuring link layer node addresses and so on. UW-Buffalo also designed a channel emulator which can work with Matlab to conduct controlled experiments, and it also supports IPv6 protocol for the Internet access.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>. Unlike the traditional layer-based architecture, UnetStack has a highly flexible architecture which consists of a variety of agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. These versatile agents take charge of particular functions related to traditional operations of physical-, MAC-, link-, routing-, transport-or application layer. UnetStack is also highly extensible, and so new user-defined agents can be added to satisfy the requirements of customized applications. The agents in UnetStack communicate freely with any other agents in the form of request, response and notification, which greatly facilitate the sharing of system information and improve adaptability accordingly. UnetStack supports both discrete-event simulation and real-time testing, and therefore its compiled binary simulation code can be used directly by copying them into UnetStack-compatible modems (e.g., Subnero modem) for further field-level testing without any additional cross-compilation.</p><p>UNET-2 provides programmable physical, MAC as well as network layers, and hence it enables customized modems to dynamically change communication techniques in accordance with rapidly varying environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>. The carrier frequency can be changed up to 78 kHz, and the modulation bandwidth can also be dynamically adjusted. Furthermore, with each packet, it provides varying transmit power levels in 1 dB step interval. Researchers are also allowed to configure userdefined preambles of the modem, which indirectly controls forward error coding (FEC). Moreover, researcher can create multiple channels, e.g., a control channel and a data channel. The control channel has low-rate FEC through taking robust communication modulation (e.g., incoherent signaling scheme OFDM) techniques into account, while the data channel has high-rate FEC with coherent signaling scheme OFDM. The parameters of those modulation schemes (e.g., packet length and number of carriers) can all be dynamically controlled. e) SeaNet: Several versions of SeaNet appeared, namely SeaNet G0, G1 and G2. SeaNet G0 (2014) is based on GNU/USRP architecture, and intends to provide real-time physical layer adaptively while coping with rapidly time varying channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. To realize real-time adaptation capability, SeaNet G0 needs an extra low data rate robust feedback link to synchronize between the receiver and the sender. This feedback link is based on B-CSS modulation scheme, which has a variety of desired characteristics, such as reliability, lowdata rate, and resilience to underwater doppler and multi-path effects. Leveraging benefits of both SDR and CR, SeaNet provides real-time reconfiguration facility via sensing, analyzing and decision-making processes.</p><p>SeaNet offers three types of real-time reconfigurability options which are connected to the user-defined cogni-tive decision-making operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. First, SeaNet can jointly choose different modulation schemes (i.e., BPSK and QPSK) and error correction coding rates to meet preset BER based on signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of received packets dynamically. Second, SeaNet supports seamless dualmode switching operation between ZP-OFDM and DS-SS at run-time. Third, in order to maximize pre-detected SINR of receivers, SeaNet offers online code-waveform adaptation facility by adjusting the length of channel wave-form based on varying communication environments.</p><p>In 2015 and 2016, SeaNet released new versions as SeaNet G1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> and SeaNet G2, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>. SeaNet G1 discards GNU/USRP architecture of G0 as that architecture is bulky and runs on a host-PC. Instead, SeaNet G1 incorporates a compact and energy-efficient ARM Cortex-M4 based USB development board, i.e., Teensy 3.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>. Compared to SeaNet G0 which provides reconfiguration option in the lower layers, SeaNet G1 extends it to the higher layers (e.g., MAC-, network-and application layer). Its software stack is modularbased, and supports cross-layer reconfiguration.</p><p>SeaNet G2 aims to construct high speed software-defined modems that are suitable for short distance communication. In a sea trial with a 10 m horizontal communication link, the data rate can reach up to 522 kbps. This version of SeaNet incorporates a more powerful architecture, including a Xilinx Zynq-7020 Board (FPGA+ARM Cortex-A9). Furthermore, SeaNet G2 uses re-programmable hardware FP-GA to execute the functionalities of both intensive physical layer and time-critical MAC layer, which essentially result in reconfigurable physical layer, low processing latency and high-speed data transfer. With the reconfigurable FPGA, it further provides physical re-programmability features (e.g., modulation and coding scheme selection, power control and switching among different physical layer schemes). SeaNet G2 is also considered as an example of the architecture for a modular-based software. The modules of this modem are installed on Linux OS. Internet functionality, based on IPv4 and IPv6, is achieved in SeaNet G2 via an adaptation module. An innovative acoustic energy transfer module is designed and experimented in SeaNet G2 that utilizes acoustic wave energy to recharge underwater nodes in a wireless manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>.</p><p>f) NILUS: NILUS softModem is based on a generalpurpose architecture (e.g., Dual-Core ARM Cortex-A9 board) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>. With this powerful architecture, the softwaredefined stack runs on GP processors under an OS (e.g., Linux). This allows end-users to use standard high-level languages such as C or C++ for programming the modem. These languages are easier than other languages that require specific skills and knowledge, and this eventually shortens the development duration. NILUS is integrated to ns2-based DESERT framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[123]</ref>, and it is probably the first modem with high level flexibility by using high-level programming languages without emphasizing the underlying hardware details. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of devoiding energy-efficient DSP and FPGA, which incur higher energy consumption and a longer wakeup time. Hence, there is a tradeoff to balance between energy consumption and devel-opment complexity. The future version of NILUS is expected to incorporate reconfiguration capabilities (e.g., autonomous protocols switching, data-rate changing and so on) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</p><p>g) SeaModem: SeaModem is a low-cost softwaredefined modem for underwater communications in shallow water <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[124]</ref>. SeaModem provides a wide range of reconfiguring and programming options in terms of the number of modulation tones, error detection and correction algorithms and transmission power. By choosing the number of MFSK modulation tones (e.g., 2, 4 or 8), the data-rate can be changed according to 750, 1500 and 2250 bps. The transmission power can be adjusted up to 40 W. SeaModem is integrated to SUNSET framework, which supports seamless simulation, emulation and field-level testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. It is also integrated to JANUS, and a dual-PHY modem is experimented that aims to improve network interoperability among heterogeneous underwater devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[125]</ref>.</p><p>3) Commercial Modem Design: The commercial modems on the market have some different features compared to research-oriented modems. A comparative study in terms of different performance metrics, such as modem energy consumption, data rate, bandwidth and maximum transfer distance, is conducted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Although most of the commercial modems have rigid hardware architecture, several vendors began to open part of their APIs for end-users to access and modify the parameters of lower layers directly. For example, Teledyne Benthos developed a modem management interface, called MMP, on SM-75 modem for end-users to implement novel user-defined protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[126]</ref>.</p><p>a) AquaSeNT: AquaSeNT is initially developed by the University of Connecticut, and then licensed and launched as a commercial modem <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[127]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[128]</ref>. AquaSeNT is an OFDM modem based on DSP with carrier frequency of 24 kHz, and integrated with SeaLinx framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[129]</ref>. To deal with the fast varying channel, an adaptive modulation and coding scheme is designed to improve the self-adaptability feature of the modem <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[130]</ref>. Five distinct transmission modes with varying data rates are implemented by mixing different modulation schemes (e.g., QPSK, BPSK and 16-QAM) and code rates (e.g., 1/2 and 3/4). The modem switches among different modes according to some effective SNR, which is computed via the channel estimation and decoding technique.</p><p>b) Subnero: The software-defined modem, Subnero, is based on agent-based UnetStack that combines computing platforms such as Linux SBC, DSP and FPGA <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. Its typical carrier frequency is about 27 kHz, and the communication range is about 2 -3 km. Subnero supports multiple acoustic links simultaneously, such as both a low-rate control link and a high-rate data link. The typical data rate of a control link is about 500 bps, and data link is about 2 -10 kbps. Subnero provides the options to program multiple layers, and hence allows end-users to adjust and reconfigure carrier frequency, preambles, modulation schemes (e.g., PSK-OFDM, incoherent OFDM and FH-BFSK) and error correction code rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. As Subnero is based on UnetStack, it is also an extensible modem where user-defined features can be added via its simulators.</p><p>c) Develogic: Develogic released Hydro-Acoustic HAM series on 2010, and it is among the first commercial modems to open up their closed architecture to end-users for the purpose of control and reconfiguration <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>. HAM is based on TI DSP, and the carrier frequency can be changed from 2.5 kHz to 70 kHz via this. It also offers accessibility and reconfiguration facilities for physical, data link and network layers. HAM provides end-users two options to reprogram the modem. The first option is suitable for the configuration of light parameters by connecting modem to a programming terminal via either an acoustic wireless link or a wired link. With this option, parameters of adaptive signal processing control, packet retransmit control, node addresses and identification, can be reprogrammed conveniently and verify protocols quickly. The second option is used for complex reprogramming, such as adding new functionalities to the modem (e.g., modulation schemes and error correction schemes) or upgrading old protocols. This needs a programming tool (e.g., Texas Instrument's Code Composer Studio and GNU) to reprogram the modem's software via C/C++ language, and then compile the software into a new hex firmware file uploaded into the modem.</p><p>d) Evologic: EvoLogics released the WiSE modem series on 2012, which provides open environments for end-users to control and customize the modem <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>. WiSE is with sweep-spread carrier, and based on DSP and FPGA hardware. A Linux virtual machine is run on the hardware of WiSE modem. When WiSE is integrated to GNU radio, it can be re-programmed via scripting languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[131]</ref>. WiSE is compatible to multiple simulation frameworks (e.g., NS-2/NS-Miracle based DESERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, SUNSET <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> and UnetStack <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>), which brings convenience to simulate, emulate and then deploy the same software to modem for further field-level testing. It also adopts data link layer protocol D-MAC into its firmware <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[132]</ref>.</p><p>4) Multi-Modal Modem Design: The acoustic modem is still the primary underwater communication technology for long-range and reliable data transfer. However, a wide range of underwater applications demand high-speed data transmission with short distance to carry out tasks such as retrieving sensed data or transferring video images in a very short time <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133]</ref>. Besides, underwater EM and optical communication technologies have been developed rapidly in the recent years. Accordingly, multi-modal modems can utilize these complementary methodologies jointly with the expectation to improve overall network performance. At the same time, both underwater open architecture SDOAM and the first international standardization physical modulation coding scheme JANUS support multimodal modems <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[134]</ref>. In the following, we provide the description of two typical multi-modal modems.</p><p>a) AquaNodes: AquaNodes is probably the first experimental multi-modal SDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. It uses 532 nm light for optical communication that ranges from 2.2 m to 8 m with a cone angle varying from 30 to 90 degrees. The maximum data rate can reach up to 320 kbps with a range about 2 m, and the acoustic link can reach up to 330 bps with a maximum of 400 m range. Researchers can adjust duty cycle of the hardware, and program both data sampling frequency and communication rate accordingly.</p><p>b) FMM: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, a flexible and modular-based multimodal modem, which is denoted as FMM in this paper, is pro-posed for short-range underwater communication. Its hardware includes Xilinx Zynq-7010 processor with dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 as well as DSP and FPGA. The modem supports acoustic, electrical and optical front-ends. Besides, for the ease of control, it provides a wide range of reconfigurable and programmable features in terms of signal amplitude scaling, error control code, carrier frequency, data rate and modulation scheme. The modem also supports cognitive channel characterization feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[135]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Standardization and Interoperability Design:</head><p>To standardize the SDM stack and enhance interoperability among modems, great efforts have been undertaken. In the following, we discuss these efforts for SDOAM and JANUS.</p><p>a) SDOAM: SDOAM is a software-defined open architecture of underwater acoustic modem, which is proposed by NATO STO CMRE <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[136]</ref>. In this structure, many OSIlike modules are fully connected to a cross-layer framework. In each of these modules, multiple parallel protocols are managed by a policy engine, which is the intelligent component of the module. This policy engine takes charge of i) communicating with adjacent modules, ii) seamless switching between parallel protocols in its module, iii) exchanging information with cross-layer framework directly. If the cross-layer framework evolves towards a local intelligent center, SDOAM would turn into a cognitive system, which has the capability of coping with varying environments in an adaptive manner in order to achieve optimized performance.</p><p>SDOAM works well with proprietary coding schemes, and hence it can protect intellectual property by abstracting them as black-boxes with standard interfaces, which can be connected to the module. Accordingly, SDOAM supports multi-modal modem facility easily. NEMO refines SDOAM further by supporting run-time reconfigurability features and providing a bridge between underwater and above surface communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[136]</ref>.</p><p>b) JANUS: JANUS is the first international standardization effort to break interoperability barrier of underwater assets to communicate with each other freely using acoustic modems from different vendors <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[134]</ref>. Originally developed by NATO CMRE, JANUS has extensively been tested over the last decade with different application scenarios, and it was approved as the first international digital acoustic communication standard by NATO in March 2017. It can be adopted by both military and civilian community, and used as a global common language for undersea systems to communicate and work in a cooperative manner.</p><p>Although JANUS is basically a physical modulation and coding scheme, it does not aim to substitute the proprietary modulation schemes of existing modems forcefully. Instead, it supports a "bilingual" mechanism in order to be able to communicate via two "languages" <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[125]</ref>. When two JANUS-equipped underwater devices communicate, they first announce themselves on commonly-used frequency (i.e., 11.5 kHz) channel with <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> km effective communication range. After that, if the devices want to connect, they switch to their proprietary modulation schemes for high data-rate communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[137]</ref>. JANUS also allows a modem to have multi-modality feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>.</p><p>6) Brief Summary of SDM: Historically, the role of underwater modem has experienced from point-to-point communications and networked communications towards softwaredefined cognitive communications. To satisfy the surging diverse application demands, the original rigid, inflexible and closed-form architecture has been substituted by reconfigurable and programmable software-defined cognitive architectures. SDMs are the fundamental blocks of the next-generation software-defined networks although there are still many significant challenges remaining in this arena.</p><p>SDR is generally a node-level software-defined technology which focuses on solving physical-and MAC layer issues of underwater modems and enabling reconfigurable, adaptable and programmable communication devices. As novel highlevel technologies have been developed, their efficient implementation depends on the underlying hardware (e.g., SDM). For example, integrating network layer paradigms such as SDN or NFV into underwater networks requires supported SDM (e.g., OpenFlow-enabled SDM). Consequently, further research is required to integrate these technologies together.</p><p>As underwater optical and EM communication technologies have become more mature recently, incorporating multiple communication technologies to develop multi-modal modems are gaining their momentum <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Nevertheless, exploiting the advantages of these complementary technologies fully will bring multiple benefits such as maximizing data rate, improving network robustness, and enhancing network flexibility and adaptability. Although there has been some progress on it, more research is required. For example, how to integrate multiple hardware front-ends into one single modem efficiently and how to switch between these front-ends in a seamless manner, require more efforts to figure out.</p><p>Although next-generation software-defined underwater networks bring a number of potential benefits, these networks need to run more complex protocols and more tasks are required to be carried out. The desired network performances come at the cost of putting more of the burden on energyconstrained SDMs, which require more computational capacity and energy consumption. Designing platform-independent protocols without considering details of the underlying hardware reduces development complexity although general-purpose S-DM architecture incurs higher energy consumption. Accordingly, trade-offs among energy efficiency, protocol complexity and hardware capacity are inevitable.</p><p>Further advancements of SDM depend on the development of both research-oriented and commercial SDMs. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>, commercial modems, such as Subnerno, Develogic HAM and Evologics WiSE, are among the leading commercial SDMs. Generally, scientific-oriented research is more likely to be in favor of novel ideas. Whereas, commercial modems offer better overall performance (e.g., reliability, maximum transfer distance and energy efficiency) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Therefore, establishing more cooperation among universities, research institutes and industry should significantly boost the advancements of SDMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Underwater CR</head><p>CR is an extension of SDR, and is envisioned as a promising technique that can redefine communication devices and enable them with a variety of properties (e.g., awareness, intelligence, learning ability, adaptivity, reliability and efficiency) by continuous interactions with the surrounding environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[138]</ref>. The paradigm is applied to underwater domain as underwater CR, which is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[139]</ref>. The goal of underwater CR is to build up intelligence by continuous interaction with operating environments to tackle challenging problems (e.g., channel uncertainties, adversary jamming and so on) by reconfiguring operation parameters (e.g., modulation strategy, transmit power and carrier-frequency).</p><p>Based on CR, underwater networks evolve towards underwater cognitive networks, the idea of which results in several interesting research topics. Note that the original concept of CR was proposed by Mitola <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[140]</ref>. It has a broader scope of research though it is usually referred as a promising technique that is mainly associated with the management of cognitive spectrum access <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[141]</ref>. In the following, we discuss two potential research areas of underwater cognitive networks, e.g., cognitive spectrum management and cognitive self-adaptive system.</p><p>1) Cognitive Spectrum Management: Inspired by the successful utilization of terrestrial radio spectrum management, CR has been extended to underwater networks for enhancing underwater spectrum efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. This spectrum management is also environment-friendly, i.e., not to interfere with other acoustic communication systems or the communication of marine animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[142]</ref>. We illustrate the development of cognitive spectrum management and cognitive self-adaptive systems as follows.</p><p>a) Underwater Acoustic Spectrum Characteristics: The utilization of underwater acoustic spectrum demonstrates several unique characteristics, which include spectrum scarcity, heavily shared spatio-temporally varying spectrum (man-made systems, marine animals) and under-utilized spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Generally speaking, underwater acoustic spectrum is a precious and scarce resource. The available underwater bandwidth is severely limited due to the effects of frequency-dependent attenuation, and hence most commercial underwater modems generally use a narrow bandwidth from approximately a few kHz to 100 kHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Furthermore, the spectrum is heavily shared by both man-made artificial acoustic systems (e.g., underwater network modems, sonar systems of ships, AUVs, UUVs and ROVs) and natural marine mammals (e.g., whales, dolphins, sea lions and porpoises) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. With the advancement of underwater networks, more man-made systems have crowded into ecosystems of marine animals aggressively. Since those underwater animals use overlapped acoustic spectrum dedicated to man-made systems for communications, echolocation and foraging <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[142]</ref>, we should take their lives into serious consideration and design environment-friendly underwater communication systems that carefully avoid harmful interference.</p><p>Although underwater acoustic spectrum is scarce and heavily shared, due to the spatio-temporally varying characteristic, this precious spectrum is not even fully utilized especially when multiple underwater networks are deployed in the same area. The underutilized spectrum can be identified both in temporal and spatial domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The temporally under-Spectrum Sensing Spectrum Decision Spectrum Sharing Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>: A sample architecture of cognitive spectrum management.</p><p>utilized acoustic spectrum can stem from the movement of users (e.g., AUVs and marine animals) or low duty cycle feature of acoustic media. The nodes, equipped with lowtraffic long-term applications (e.g., environments monitoring, offshore assets structure health monitoring), only wake-up periodically and then listen or send out sensed data. As a result, these nodes remain in the sleep mode most of the time. The spatially underutilized acoustic spectrum is usually caused by nonlinear acoustic wave propagation (e.g., shadow zones) and directional communication characteristics of marine mammals or directional acoustic modems.</p><p>b) The Dynamic Spectrum Management Procedure: This procedure takes advantages of cognitive radio to design environment-friendly and spectrum-aware communication algorithms for underwater networks while utilizing the scarce underutilized spectrum dynamically and intelligently. To realize the goal of cognitive spectrum management, underwater software-defined communication devices should have the properties, such as awareness, intelligence, reconfigurability and adaptivity, reliability and efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[138]</ref>.</p><p>The basic concepts of cognitive cycle for terrestrial wireless systems are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[143]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[144]</ref>, which focus on fundamental cognitive tasks, such as radio scene analysis of inference and spectrum holes, channel capacity estimation, prediction and dynamic spectrum access. Based on these ideas, a more general architecture for cognitive spectrum management in UWSNs is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the architecture associated with cognitive spectrum management includes three primary parts (e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision and spectrum sharing) which are correlated to each other.</p><p>Note that, in this framework, the implementation of both spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing procedures is based on software-defined programmable and reconfigurable communication devices (e.g., underwater modems) as those devices provide flexible reprogramming and reconfiguration options for both the physical and link layers. Overall, the research on underwater cognitive spectrum management is still in its infancy. For more detailed information in this context, please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>.</p><p>-Spectrum Sensing: The goal of spectrum sensing is to identify the available spectrum, detect unused spectrum holes and the changes of spectrum utilization in real time by sensing and monitoring the surrounding environment continuously. To do that, it needs a spectrum sensing scheme where suitable detection approaches (e.g., energy detectionbased, power spectrum density-based, waveform-based and cyclostationarity-based) are incorporated in accordance with the requirements of entire spectrum management <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>-Spectrum Decision: Based on the sensed information and the available spectrum, decisions should be made intelligently by analyzing and accumulating knowledge through continuous interactions with the environment (e.g., channel state information). One output of spectrum decision is to plan spectrum distribution scheme (e.g., available spectrum allocation).</p><p>-Spectrum Sharing: The objective of the spectrum sharing is to implement dynamic spectrum access scheme by reconfiguring the operation parameters of software-defined cognitive devices (e.g., acoustic modems). Besides that, those cognitive devices should be operated in a cooperative manner. For example, to maintain harmony between the receiver and the transmitter during the process of dynamic spectrum access, a feedback channel (or control channel) should be established <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[145]</ref>.</p><p>2) Cognitive Self-Adaptive System: CR has software-based intelligence in various aspects, e.g., awareness, analyzing and learning, decision making and reconfiguration. It is virtualized as a human "brain" with the capability of joint sensing, decision making and actuation operations intelligently. Accordingly, leveraging the cognitive intelligence of CR, cognitive self-adaptive system is designed to enhance node or network adaptivity.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[146]</ref>, an underwater cognitive self-adaptive protocol stack is proposed. As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, it consists of several parts to sense or monitor, analyze or learn, decide or plan and execute or reconfigure. All those parts are connected through a cross-layer shared knowledge module. To provide cognitive self-adaptive capability, a famous feedback loop MAPE-K is applied to underwater domain and integrated to the architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[147]</ref>. The MAPE-K loop enables researchers to design a cognitive policy engine, which is an intelligent agent. Being in the situation of underwater domains, this policy engine perceives surrounding environment through sensors as primitive information input. Then, the sensed data are processed while considering pre-defined requirements into account, and an optimized decision is made as an output executed by the actuators. Through the common communication environments, feedback information connects both the input and the output as a feedback-control loop, which makes the decision-making process recursive to obtain more refined results.</p><p>This cognitive architecture can be implemented on sensor nodes or on a sink node with centralized capability. It can also be implemented in a distributed manner (e.g., in the sink, cluster headers and sensor nodes) in order to virtualize itself into a single logical cognitive system. For implementing cognitive architecture in a centralized fashion (e.g., sinks and clusterheaders), more complicated machine learning techniques are required to be incorporated to the system. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[146]</ref>, reinforcement learning technique is integrated to the policy engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[148]</ref>. The cognitive architecture improves the self-adaptive capability of a single node as well as of the entire network. For example, when implementing cognitive architectures inside modems, the self-adaptive capability is demonstrated as realtime reconfigurable physical-and MAC layer with pre-defined metrics according to the diverse requirements of applications or varying communication environments. To verify the performance, a simulation is conducted while considering that the system is equipped with six one-hop nodes and a sink <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[146]</ref>. The system can automatically switch seamlessly between three MAC layer protocols (e.g., CSMA, T-Lohi and DACAP) with different metrics (e.g., packet delivery ratio, end-to-end latency and energy per bit) in accordance with the changes of dynamic communication environments.</p><p>3) Brief Summary of Underwater CR: The existing research on underwater CR primarily focuses on the development of a cognitive spectrum management system and a cognitive intelligent system. One common feature of these smart systems is that they are environment-aware and capable of reconfiguring system-level operational parameters in real-time (e.g., communication parameters, sensing parameters and actuator parameters) to carry out pre-defined tasks smartly. Under this point of view, the cognitive spectrum management systems are considered as a special use case of the cognitive intelligent systems. However, to turn this paradigm into reality for UWSNs, the researchers have to face numerous challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[139]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[146]</ref>.</p><p>Although underwater spectrum is heavily shared while being underutilized to a great extent, in order to develop a practical environment-friendly and spectrum-efficient cognitive system, three primary parts of the system (e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision and spectrum sharing) should be addressed carefully. Four key factors are identified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> which affect the design of a cognitive system (e.g., the narrowband response of acoustic transducer, the long preamble, the severe busy terminal problem and the highly dynamic underwater channel). Other factors (e.g., depth, distance, shipping, waves, spectrum management delay and accessibility) which affect dynamic spectrum sharing feature, are explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. How to find spectrum holes and how to change access mode in an adaptive manner to avoid possible jamming as well as frequency selective fading, are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[139]</ref>. In addition to that, the importance of a stable feedback channel which is used for interactions between a sender and a receiver, is also investigated.</p><p>As acoustic attenuation is dependent on both the frequency and the transmission distance, this feature can be utilized in the development of a spectrum access scheme. Since high frequency channels suffer from higher attenuation, given that the overall location of the network is available, these channels are allocated to nodes which are closer to each other in order to maximize fairness and efficient utilization of the spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[141]</ref>. Having realize this fact, an effective heuristic spectrum allocation method is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[149]</ref>. As an extended work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[141]</ref>, only distance information of nodes is required in <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[150]</ref>, in which an energy detection-based spectrum sensing process leverages fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique to identify available channels.</p><p>Instead of assigning fixed spectrum, dynamic assignment of frequency channel enables a more flexible cognitive system. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[145]</ref>, a dynamic control channel access scheme is proposed while targeting on the avoidance of channel congestion. In this scheme, control channel can borrow more frequency band from in-band channels reserved for data traffic when control traffic becomes heavy. In another dynamic spectrum management scheme, namely RvDB, a receiver can borrow idle spectrum from its neighboring nodes to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[151]</ref>. A cognitive system should be not only spectrum-efficient but also environment-friendly to avoid affecting natural marine mammals in a harmful manner. Both idle spectrum and optimal transmit power allocation are jointly considered in an environment-friendly scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[152]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[153]</ref>, a receiver-initiated spectrum management scheme namely RISM is proposed, in which marine mammals are considered as primary users <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[154]</ref>. In another environmentfriendly dolphin-aware scheme, namely DAD-Tx, the activities of dolphins are modeled and then integrated into the system to prevent harmful interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[142]</ref>.</p><p>Derived from unique characteristics of underwater CR (e.g., sensing/analyzing, learning/decision making/ reconfiguring and acting), the cognitive intelligence can be used to design cognitive systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[155]</ref>, cognitive intelligence is used to select accurate underwater channel model from a database in accordance with the communication environment. Another cognitive self-adaptive system, which can reconfigure its operating parameters according to the change of communication environments and application requirements, is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[146]</ref>. It integrates cross-layer information sharing concept, cognitive policy engine, modular-based software defined communication stack, sensors and actuators together. By leveraging reinforcement learning techniques in its cognitive policy engine, the system can automatically select suitable protocols from multiple pre-defined parallel protocols in each layer. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[156]</ref>, the modular-based software defined communication stack has recently been integrated into a famous testbed platform, SUNSET.</p><p>Testing and experiments of cognitive schemes would significantly enhance the development of practical systems. However, most of the existing underwater acoustic modems lack the capability to implement cognitive networks. To meet that end, a real-time underwater cognitive testbed <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[135]</ref> is developed based on SeaNet G0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. Via this testbed, underwater cognitive channelization experiments can be conducted in a water tank by selecting optimized waveforms adaptively in accordance with the channel conditions.</p><p>Except for the aforementioned research, other aspects of cognitive systems are also explored. For example, the interference problems and cognitive routing are investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[138]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[157]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[159]</ref>. The dynamic spectrum sharing for sparse heterogeneous underwater networks (e.g., including AUVs) is explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Although the research of spectrum management system currently covers all the aspects of acoustic spectrum management and great progress has been made, it is still in its infancy stage to a great extent. For example, there is no at-sea experiment reported, and more practical fieldlevel testing and evaluation results are required. As underwater multi-modal modems have the advantage of selecting different communication options, applying the cognitive paradigm to this concept requires further investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. UNDERWATER SOFTWARE-DEFINED SENSOR NETWORKS</head><p>A. Overview of Software-Defined Networks SDN is an emerging paradigm which has successfully been applied in wired networks initially, and it was later applied to terrestrial wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[160]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[161]</ref>. The primary goal of software-defined networks is to decouple the control plane from the data plane by separating control decisions from hardware devices (e.g., switches and routers), and therefore these devices are equipped with only simple data forwarding functionalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. The separation makes the network management easier as the controllers become smarter with the global view of the entire network. Besides that, the separation also shifts the energy intensive burden from these physical devices to physically or logically centralized controllers, which are in charge of the control plane. Furthermore, to efficiently manage network devices, the controller needs to program the hardware infrastructure in order to directly control them by defining their behaviors and operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Consequently, it not only simplifies network management and improves resource utilization, but more importantly it enhances the interoperability of devices from different vendors and enables quick network innovation and evolution.</p><p>To enable a programmable data plane, a set of standards, well-defined and open APIs between the control and data plane should be designed <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[162]</ref>. OpenFlow is one of the most prominent interfaces of such APIs. It was originally developed for Ethernet switches and routers, which has attracted considerable attentions in both academia and industry recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[163]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[165]</ref>. The success of OpenFlow lies in the fact that most modern switches and routers are programmed with flowtables. Therefore, OpenFlow adds a number of new features to existing switches, which make them programmable without disclosure of internal secrets of these commercial devices.</p><p>A sample architecture of OpenFlow interface is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, and it is widely supported from a large number of network vendors including Cisco, HP, Juniper, Brocade, IBM, Dell, NEC and Big Switch <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[166]</ref>. The OpenFlow architecture consists of three parts, which are a Flow  at least one action to execute (e.g., drop the flow's packets, forward the flow's packets through the network or send the flow's packets to a controller).</p><p>As the control functionality in SDN has been decoupled from the data plane, OpenFlow controller (either static controller running on PCs or logically centralized controller) takes the responsibilities of packet processing decision by updating Flow Table entries (e.g., add, delete or revise). In order to make the optimized data processing decision, the controller also needs to gather network information (e.g., network status and topology), and exchange control packets timely and efficiently with these OpenFlow switches.</p><p>The secure channel connects each switch with the remote controller to transfer command packets, and OpenFlow protocol provides an open standard interface for the controller to externally setup and update the Flow Table entries. Naturally, both the secure channel and the OpenFlow protocol are designed to guarantee the controller to reach, program and control the network intelligently with the help of a global view of the entire network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Potential Benefits of Applying SDN to UWSNs</head><p>With the growing interest of applying SDN to wireless networks, researchers attempt to expand this concept into UWSNs to help tackle its inherent fundamental problems. We argue that a number of benefits can be derived from the SDNenabled adaptive solutions for UWSNs.</p><p>1) Improvement of Energy Efficiency: In SDN-enabled UWSNs, the controller is more intelligent with the global view of the entire network (e.g., node location, node residual energy, node failure and communication link quality). For example, it can select optimized routing paths to save node energy and prolong the network lifetime. Another benefit is that, because of decoupling the data plane from the control plane, the separation also relieves and shifts the energy intensive burden from normal sensor nodes to controllers, which usually reside in underwater sinks. These sinks are equipped with either solar power systems or enough battery capacity, and so the lifetime of software-defined networks can be prolonged.</p><p>2) Simplification of Network Management: UWSNs are decentralized ad hoc networks, and hence it is a complex and challenging task to manage them efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[167]</ref>. On the contrary, SDN enforces the centralized management aspect to allocate network resources efficiently and maximize the network throughput by leveraging the powerful and intelligent controllers. On the other hand, both network abstraction and programmable data plane make it easier to control or customize the physical resources without directly interfering their hardware operations. Other benefits derived from the centralized management include: reduced complexity of network error checking procedure and simplified network maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>3) Enhancement of Interoperability: Establishing interoperability among heterogeneous devices from different vendors greatly facilitates the development of UWSNs by providing open standardized interfaces that exchange messages freely. However, the standardization process is slow, partially because most of the commercial vendors are reluctant to disclose their internal design in fear of losing competitive advantages in the commercial market.</p><p>The OpenFlow-based SDN paradigm provides an opportunity for researchers to bypass this problem by just installing Flow Table on existing hardware without exposing or changing internal platforms of the hardware. Therefore, a well-designed OpenFlow-based interface between data plane control plane regardless of the underlying hardware infrastructure from different vendors is expected to increase interoperability among heterogeneous devices under SDN-enabled architecture.</p><p>4) Multi-Modal Communication Support: In softwaredefined networks, the underlying hardware is accessed and controlled directly via a variety of high-level abstractions as well as through its flexible programmable data plane. Hence, it is convenient to exploit the advantages of diverse underwater communication technologies, such as acoustic, optical and EM, to satisfy specific application requirements in terms of delay, reliability and throughput <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[168]</ref>.</p><p>5) Multi-Application Support: Coupled with high-level abstractions to coordinate underlying infrastructure efficiently, sensor networks are no longer application-oriented, but are application-customizable, which enable multiple applications running on one single network simultaneously to accomplish different tasks. Leveraging such advantages, researchers design OpenFlow-based APIs, and are able to develop sensing-as-aservice oriented networks for various applications by sharing the same physical hardware efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>6) Network Evolution and Experiment Support: In conventional sensor networks, evaluation of novel protocols via experimentation is both costly and complicated as it may require access to micro-controller or even ROM of the node through reprogramming <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[169]</ref>. In software-defined networks, the programmable data plane provides flexibility to support multiple applications. Consequently, it is convenient to implement novel protocols as independent applications in parallel with other applications in the same network. This not only reduces the experimental cost, but also accelerates network evolution. More importantly, it provides real underwater net-work working environments which will significant enhance the effectiveness of both experiments and network evolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Challenges of SDN-Enabled UWSNs</head><p>Encouraged by the success of SDN on both wired networks and wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[164]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[170]</ref>, SDN is envisioned as a promising technology to solve inherent problems with both terrestrial and underwater WSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[166]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref>. However, additional functionalities need to be designed since there are a number of distinguishable characteristics between conventional wired or wireless networks and UWSNs, which raise new challenges when SDN is enabled to UWSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The primary challenges are summarized as follows.</p><p>In SDN-enabled conventional wired or wireless networks, the programmable switches, routers or wireless APs have adequate electric power supply. On the contrary, UWSNs consist of resource-constrained sensor nodes in terms of limited battery power supply and computational capability. The paradigm of SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, so switches act only as data forwarding devices under the control plane. However, in UWSNs, the sensor nodes not only forward data within the network, but also monitor physical environment and generate data.</p><p>Furthermore, UWSNs are typically data-centric networks, which require real-time in-network data processing (e.g., filtering out error messages and aggregating statistically measured data). Note that the performance of in-network data processing and aggregation not only reduces the number of data transmissions in order to conserve both energy and precious bandwidth, but also ensures immediate and collaborative local decision-making process. Another challenge that needs to be addressed is, UWSNs are inherently application-oriented, in which both hardware and software resources are usually vertically integrated for cross-layer optimization, which may impair the performance of software-defined networks.</p><p>Moreover, in OpenFlow-based SDN, the secure channel is used for the transmission of control messages between switches and the controllers, in which the reliable communication is guaranteed by IP-based end-to-end connections. However, the conventional UWSNs are firstly data-centric networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Furthermore, the unique characteristics of underwater acoustic communications (e.g., high bit error, long delay, spatially and temporally varying intermittent communication channel, node mobility and node failure) present challenges in implementing such secure control channel in harsh underwater environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. SDN-Enabled Architecture for UWSNs</head><p>The research on SDN-enabled underwater communication networking is relatively a new research area, which is still in its infancy, although a few papers recently appeared that attempted to bring the concept of SDN into underwater communication systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[173]</ref>. In this subsection, we first briefly introduce the general architecture of SDN-enabled UWSNs, and then discuss various aspects of the architecture in detail.</p><p>The core idea behind the general architecture of SDNenabled UWSNs is to separate the data forwarding plane and the control plane, and to provide software-oriented hardware resources, which can be programmed and customized by the powerful logically centralized intelligent controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The general architecture of SDN-enabled UWSNs is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, which consists of three layered planes: data plane, control plane and application plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. These planes are connected to each other via a variety of APIs, in which the APIs between control plane and the data plane are called southbound APIs whereas the APIs between the control plane and the application plane are called northbound APIs.</p><p>The control plane, which resides on a logically centralized controller, is a decision maker. It is equipped with the global view of the network through the periodic collection of network state information. Utilizing these centralized knowledge, the controller is able to make intelligent decisions to configure and coordinate underlying allocated resources by customizing and updating the flow table in the data plane via a standardized southbound communication interface, such as OpenFlow-based APIs. To effectively manage the network, a variety of functions in the control plane should be designed, which include topology control, routing control, node mobility control, QoS control, traffic control, data congestion control, security control, energy control, network configuration control, spectrum control, network maintenance control and so on.</p><p>The data plane is the infrastructure plane with heterogeneous underwater static or mobile devices deployed on the seafloor, on the sea surface or in the deep ocean. Under the SDN paradigm, the date plane consists of OpenFlowbased programmable underwater sensor nodes with packet forwarding, environment sensing, in-network data processing or response capability. To fully program the data plane, each sensor node needs to be equipped with an OpenFlow-supported flow table with packets forwarding rules, defined and updated by the intelligent controller via the southbound APIs.</p><p>The application plane consists of multiple applications, e.g., that for ocean environment monitoring, marine surveillance, Fig. <ref type="figure">9:</ref> A sample controller on the sea floor. offshore assets protection, disaster salvation and others. The implementation of these applications need both control plane and data plane to be executed via the communication of welldefined northbound and southbound APIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Control Plane Design</head><p>The control plane is the centralized control policy management center that orchestrates between the application plane and the infrastructure data plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. As most of the control functions are shifted from sensor nodes to the intelligent controller, the controller becomes more critical with the growing volume of managerial and control responsibilities. In this section, we mainly discuss the issues, such as controller models, single or multiple controllers, controller placement and control traffic.</p><p>1) Controller Models: The main functionality of the controller is to manage the network by generating flow tables for the data plane. Due to the unique characteristics of UWSNs different from terrestrial wired and wireless networks, we can choose two types of control plane models, such as centralized and semi-centralized while considering the split of the managerial responsibilities among different entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref>.</p><p>-Centralized Controller Model: In the centralized control model, the network management functions are completely taken over by controllers, which relieve ordinary sensor nodes from the complex self-control management task. Hence, underwater sensor nodes are designed to execute operations controlled by remote controllers, and perform specific tasks efficiently and effectively. However, this model may only work well for small-scale networks with a limited number of sensor nodes. Furthermore, it might be difficult for sensor nodes to carry out complex tasks efficiently and cooperatively with this model, especially when faster intelligent decision making is required in response to the emergency events for delaysensitive applications.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref>, a completely centralized control scheme is proposed for a mobile AUV network. For AUV-based applications, the number of AUVs is usually limited and even the movements of these AUVs are predictable via pre-programmed paths. Based on these facts, the authors designed a centralized control scheme to control the entire small-scale mobile network, including the planning of routing decisions, movement decisions and so on for each AUV.</p><p>-Semi-Centralized Controller Model: The original terrestrial software-defined network is naturally a software-driven network that leverages its powerful centralized intelligent controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. However, when equipping this concept to underwater communication domain, an alternative model, which is called semi-centralized control model, could be taken to design semi-software-defined-networks. The reason is that UWSNs have many unique characteristics unlike terrestrial wired or wireless networks. UWSNs not only work in a harsh communication environment with limited resources such as unreliable communication channels, longer transmission delay, limited battery supply, limited computation capability, but also need to perform complex tasks which might require immediate actions in response to the emergency events besides sensing and packet forwarding decisions.</p><p>In the semi-centralized control model, the management of control function is divided between the controllers and underwater sensor nodes. Hence, it is a combination of both the centralized control and self-control, and makes a balance between centralized and distributed networks, which obtains benefits from both the centralized control and fully distributed management. Although the division of the control function management complicates the control mechanism in SDNenabled UWSNs, the tradeoff is inevitable due to the harsh underwater environment, and there is still a large space for the researchers to decide how to split the control management functions between the controllers and underwater sensor nodes.</p><p>2) Single or Multiple Controllers: In conventional UWSNs, one or more sinks are deployed in the network, which are responsible for both the data collection and network control. Hence, under the SDN paradigm, these sinks could be mapped to controllers naturally. Depending on different requirements of network scenarios, the number of controllers could be single or multiple.</p><p>-Single Controller: In a small-scale network, a single centralized controller is sufficient for the management of control functions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref>, a single central controller architecture is proposed for small-scale underwater mobile AUV networks. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, a single controller is deployed on the sea floor. One weakness of the single centralized controller is, it is vulnerable to security attacks. Another drawback is that, as network scales, the increased number of sensor nodes cause a large amount of control traffic and a higher control delay. This causes a communication bottleneck in the controller that in turn decreases the efficiency of network management.</p><p>-Multiple Controllers: The design associated with multiple controllers helps to improve network scalability in addressing the increased control communication overhead especially with large-scale networks. Generally, these geographically distributed controllers require to form a logically centralized controller across the entire network. However, the number of controllers and their placement have a significant impact on the effectiveness of these controllers.</p><p>To reduce control overhead and simplify controllers management, a hierarchical controller architecture can be used, in which a logically centralized controller is realized by many distributed local controllers. Accordingly, each local controller Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10:</ref> A sample deployment scenario of a surface controller. manages a cluster which is formed by either geographical location or other metrics. In such an architecture, tradeoffs may need to be made in terms of the centralized control or the distributed control. For example, local controllers should actively respond to the requirements of cluster network management without incurring too much overhead for remote controllers.</p><p>fully benefit from such logically centralized controller, these controllers need to synchronize periodically themselves to exchange and share the global network information, which require reliable and effective inter-controller communications.</p><p>3) Controller Placement: In three-dimensional ocean space, the deployment scenarios of controllers can be both stationary and mobile. When controllers are stationary, they can be placed on the sea surface mounted on floating buoys, on the sea floor or in the deep oceans. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, a single controller is deployed on the sea surface, whereas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, a multi-controller deployment scheme is proposed for the sea surface. The benefits of deploying controllers on the sea surface are twofold. First, these controllers can utilize solar power to support long-term ocean operations. Second, multiple physically distributed surface controllers can leverage the high speed radio communication systems to form logically centralized controllers with higher bandwidth and shorter delays.</p><p>The stationary placement of controllers has a dramatic impact on the network performance. However, the optimal solution to find the placement of multiple controllers is still an open NP-hard problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[174]</ref>. Furthermore, one shortcoming of the stationary deployment of controllers is that it might lead to the unbalanced control load among the controllers as well as the sensor nodes. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> also pointed out that the stationary placement of controllers may result in the degradation of control plane performance due to the changes of data traffic pattern with the ever-changing communication environment.</p><p>An alternative solution to the stationary deployment of controllers is to deploy a single or multiple mobile controllers. These mobile controllers can be deployed on the sea surface with USVs or ASVs as well as deployed in the deep ocean with AUVs. As these mobile controllers are usually powered by rechargeable battery units, they support long-term missions which can last several months. Aside from that, these mobile controllers can also serve as mobile sinks that retrieve sensed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[175]</ref>.</p><p>To perform multiple tasks effectively, these AUVs can be equipped with multi-modal communication technologies, such as acoustic, optical and so on. Acoustic links can be used for long-range and lower data rate control channel, whereas optical links can be used for short-range and high speed data retrieval purpose. Since the transmit power is usually more expensive than that of the receive mode (e.g., typical receive power of the WHOI micro-modem is about 80 mW, but transmit power is 10 W), AUVs can broadcast control messages while underwater sensor nodes just passively listen so as to reduce their energy consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[176]</ref>.</p><p>When deploying multiple mobile controllers in a given network to cover three-dimensional deployment space under multiple criteria, the number of controllers, as as AUVs path planning to be resolved via optimization algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[177]</ref>. Another problem with mobile controllers is its long time delay as AUVs usually travel at relatively slow speed. For example, the speed of one type of REMUS is in [1.5-2.9] m/s range with which it consumes around W level of power <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Under such slow speed, in large-scale networks, mobile controllers experience longer control delays.</p><p>4) Control Traffic: To control and manage the underlying resources of the data plane, the controllers need to communicate with the sensor devices via southbound APIs, which incur additional control communication overhead using either out-of-band control channels or in-band control channels. We discuss them in detail as follows.</p><p>-Out-of-Band Control: Just as the secure channel in wired SDN-enabled networks, an out-of-band control channel can be reserved and dedicated only for control traffic in UWSNs. For example, while deploying multiple controllers on the sea surface with floating buoys as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, low power wide area technologies such as NB-IoT, LoRa or other longrange RF wireless communication technologies could be used for one-hop out-of-band control traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[178]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[180]</ref>.</p><p>Except for the usage of RF to form control channels above the ocean surface, other communication links could be chosen as dedicated channels for the management of control traffic especially when underwater sensor nodes are equipped with multiple communication technologies (e.g., optical, acoustic or EM). For example, we can use the long-range acoustic link dedicated for the communication of underwater control traffic to realize one-hop out-of-band control, whereas other communication links for the transmission of multi-hop data packets. The paper in <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref> proposed a scheme to deploy a centralized underwater controller using one-hop long-range acoustic communication links to reach AUVs in the network. Instead of benefiting from such long-range acoustic communications, its shortcomings, such as high propagation delay and limited bandwidth, should be considered carefully when designing control protocols in terms of minimum delay, maximum throughput and congestion control.</p><p>-In-Band Control: Different from out-of-band control where a separate channel is dedicated for control messages, both control traffic and data traffic must share the same channel via in-band control, which impose significant challenges in terms of uncertain wireless link quality and possible traffic congestion. Compared to the traditional terrestrial wired or wireless networks, in which SDN is originally developed, efficient management of UWSNs generally requires the exchange of more control messages. Thereby, special considerations should be taken to reduce control traffic, and relieve the burden of communication channels while designing in-band control solutions. In addition to that, it is worth noting that the number of controllers as well as their placement in deployed networks also have a great impact on the overall control overhead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Design of Data and Application Planes</head><p>The data plane primarily consists of OpenFlow-based programmable underwater sensor nodes, which can forward packets, monitor environments, generate packets, or even perform appropriate actions according to the instructions made by the control plane. To implement these predefined tasks, each sensor node should include multiple layers or modules (e.g., physical, MAC and other layers). To program the data plane, each sensor node requires to install an OpenFlow-supported flow table with a set of packet forwarding rules, which are defined and updated by the intelligent controller via the southbound APIs.</p><p>An OpenFlow-enabled programmable underwater sensor node, OF-sensor, is proposed in SoftWater <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. OF-sensor consists of four parts: Wireless Hypervisor, OpenFlow-supported Flow Table, Software-Defined Radio and Multiple hardware front-ends (e.g., acoustic, optical or EM). A node-level resource scheduler Wireless Hypervisor can create multiple virtual OpenFlow sensors, namely V-OF-sensors, that operate on different protocols or communication technologies within the same physical OF-sensor. The OpenFlow-supported flow table defines routing or control decisions in terms of sets of flow entries for an OF-sensor to handle packets, which are controlled or modified by the controllers. The PHY-and MAC layer functions are in the form of software, and so OF-sensors can easily exploit the advantages of SDR to reconfigure softwarized PHY-and MAC layer resources for the optimized performance (e.g., reconfiguration of modulation, demodulation of PHY-layer, frequency, code of MAC layer). OF-sensors also support multiple communication hardware front-ends (e.g., acoustic, optical or EM). Along with the softwarized PHY-and MAC layer, it is convenient for OFsensors to choose and reconfigure different communication options in order to fully exploit multiple communication capabilities that satisfy diverse application requirements.</p><p>In addition to these basic functionalities, other functional layers or modules should be designed to support the control plane and handle application-related tasks. For example, to help the controller build and maintain real-time network status, a layer that gathers the information of local topology could be designed. As data aggregation and in-network data processing operations effectively reduce the number of required data transmissions in order to save precious energy as well as communication bandwidth, specific layers should be designed to handle such operations.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, OpenFlow-enabled static and mobile sensor nodes are proposed, which are called OF-node and OF-AUVs, respectively. In each OF-node and OF-AUVs, OpenFlow-based forwarding tables take charge of the routing decisions of data forwarding operations. An OF-node also includes a cognitive module to perform run-time switching operation among multiple software-defined hardware front-ends intelligently. Apart from these components, a local neighbor table is included in an OF-node to store instant neighbors that are one or more hops away. To deal with data aggregation or in-network data processing tasks, a local data storage and processing component is designed. A node cooperation module is also designed in an OF-node to improve the cooperation efficiency among static or mobile OF-based nodes. Furthermore, security components such as context-awareness and physical layer security protocols are also designed in the OF-based nodes.</p><p>In the application plane, versatile applications (e.g., ocean monitoring, underwater surveillance, disaster salvation and underwater navigation) can be incorporated. The successful implementation of these applications needs coordination between the control plane and the data plane. Accordingly, the resources of the underlying infrastructure in the data plane can be utilized efficiently via a set of northbound and southbound APIs. Furthermore, with the help of low-and high-level virtualization, the resources of the network infrastructure can be abstracted and divided into multiple isolated slices, which support multiple applications simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Brief Summary and Further Discussions</head><p>In this subsection, we first give a brief summary of existing research, and then present discussions on the future research.</p><p>1) Brief Summary of Existing Research: Overall, the underwater SDN-enabled networking is in its early stage, and several pioneer works provided significant contributions from several aspects (e.g., general architecture, security, mobile network, routing, simulation and testbed) in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[173]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[181]</ref>. A SDN-enabled architecture generally consists of data plane, control plane and application plane, which supports multi-application, multi-modality hardware front-ends, network interoperability, evolvability and efficiency in the management process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>SoftWater is the first comprehensive SDN-enabled architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. To facilitate resource sharing and management, both softwarization and virtualization techniques are integrated into the architecture. By softwarizing physical-and MAC layer in OpenFlow-supported OF-sensor as software-defined radio, it is much easier to reconfigure and utilize hardware resources in a flexible manner. Two levels of virtualization techniques have been utilized fully, and so multiple virtual V-OF-sensors can be created within a single OF-sensor that share the same underlying hardware resources. After that, these low-level virtualized infrastructure resources are sliced into multiple isolated virtual networks to serve different applications. In addition to basic functions of the SDN-enabled architecture, a set of well-designed management tools (e.g., routing control, and out-of-band traffic control, mobility control and fault recovery) guarantee specific requirements of different applications (e.g., sensing, data analysis, security and QoS).</p><p>As the architecture with single controller has its disadvantage in terms of robustness, an architecture with multiple controllers that consists of both primary and secondary OFcontrollers, is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Hence, the architecture takes the advantages of both centralized and distributed control functions, which not only increases the network robustness, but reduces the overall control overhead. Furthermore, several other techniques such as cross-layer, context-awareness and network cognition are incorporated in the system to fortify network security. For example, cross-layer techniques improve both network efficiency and the implementation of effective security mechanisms. Meanwhile, the node and network cognition not only enhance communication adaptability, but help in identifying potential security threats faster.</p><p>Underwater mobile sensor networks have the advantage of operating in large areas of the ocean freely, and therefore it has great underwater application prospects. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref>, an AUV based mobile SDN-enabled architecture is proposed, in which a static centralized controller leverages a dedicated channel to control the AUV networking. A similar mobile architecture is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[173]</ref>, which is used for the search or surveillance missions. In this architecture, multiple unmanned underwater support vehicles serve as sub-controllers which control and coordinate multiple AUVs. The main controller is resided in a ship to communicate and control these sub-controllers around it. The control plane uses the dedicated channel, namely JANUS, for the dissemination of robust control messages.</p><p>As simulation and experimental platforms greatly facilitate the SDN-enabled development of UWSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, research has been carried out along with network testing and validation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, a SDN-enabled underwater simulation platform is developed based on OpenNet and ns-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[182]</ref>. In addition to that, the aforementioned mobile architectures are implemented with initial testing in a small-scale modified testbed, WaterCom <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[183]</ref>. As those testing are experimented in a water tank with six fixed OFDM acoustic modems, more evaluations of these networks especially in the open ocean are expected to verify and reveal practical factors which affect these SDN-enabled architectures. Therefore, more SDN-based simulation tools, testbeds or evaluation platforms should be designed to sufficiently evaluate SDN-enabled protocols in real scenarios in order to facilitate developing more practical and reliable SDN-enabled UWSNs.</p><p>2) Further Discussions: The SDN paradigm is generally a software-defined programming approach with many potential benefits. However, due to the inherent characteristics of UWSNs and the challenges of enabling SDN for them, a number of open issues need further exploration. For example, SDN-enabled solutions may be energy efficient (e.g., with optimized routing), but it also introduces a large level of overhead from control traffic especially in dynamic and unreliable underwater communication environments with the rapid changes of network topology. Nevertheless, the benefits of simplification and evolvability derived from SDN may be more important than general performance improvement in terms of energy efficiency. Therefore, under such specific scenarios, tradeoffs may be inevitable for the design of software-defined networks.</p><p>As both terrestrial WSNs and UWSNs have many common features (e.g., application oriented, energy constrained and limited capacity) which need to be tackled when SDN is enabled for them, the existing literature for terrestrial WSNs may shed light on the application of SDN in UWSNs. For example, as data aggregation can reduce the number of data transmissions both for underwater and terrestrial WSNs, an in-network packet processing layer designed for terrestrial wireless software-defined networks can be used for underwater networks with minor modification <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref>. However, UWSNs also have several unique characteristics which should be considered carefully. Therefore, most of the terrestrial SDN protocols cannot be directly adopted for underwater SDN. For example, in a terrestrial SDN-based architecture for WSNs, a network operating system layer is used to collect topology information <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[184]</ref>. When it is used in the mobile UWSNs, the slow speed of acoustic communication as well as unreliable communication links should be taken into account in order to obtain and maintain an accurate network topology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. UNDERWATER NETWORK FUNCTION VIRTUALIZATION (NFV) A. Basic Concept</head><p>NFV is a promising technique to decouple network functions from underlying hardware deployment, and virtualize the entire physical computing resources into softwarized network functions, which can be adaptively reconfigured and allocated quickly with high flexibility to meet diverse requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>.</p><p>The concept of network virtualization and NFV have slight difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[185]</ref>. In terrestrial networks, NFV emphasizes on separating network functions from hardware, and hosting them on servers and cloud data centers for better management of network services, while in sensor network domain, those concepts focus on virtualization of resources for better management, such as allocation, reconfiguration and utilization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Benefits of NFV</head><p>NFV is a fundamental technology that can be broadly integrated into the design of underwater software-defined networks to facilitate infrastructure utilization. The primary benefits of this concept are summarized as follows.</p><p>-Multi-Application Support: Leveraging network virtualization, the network resources of both hardware and software, sensing capability, bandwidth allocation, multiple communication options, are abstracted and integrated into complex software entities. Hence, it provides users flexibility to implement multiple underwater applications efficiently by sharing the same underlying physical communication infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. For example, the softwarized resources can be divided into several disjoint virtual networks, and hence multiple applications can cooperate simultaneously on each virtual network without interfering with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Accordingly, NFV not only enables a reusable network, but improves the efficiency of network resources.</p><p>-Deployment of Novel Applications: As network-level virtualization supports multiple applications on a single sensor network, it greatly advances network innovation of underwater technologies by allocating resources of isolated networks to test novel schemes or algorithms in field-level deployment environments. These real-time field-level experiments not only effectively enhance the quality of performance evaluation compared to underwater simulations and emulations, but greatly reduce field-level experimental costs since underwater fieldlevel experimental testbeds are extremely expensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>-Implementation of Sensing-as-a-Service Model: Network virtualization supports the implementation of sensing-as-aservice model, such as sensors-as-a-service or sensing-as-aservice. Since the isolated virtualization of networks can be dedicated to different operators and service providers, this significantly enhances the sharing of network infrastructure and facilitates the implementation of different sensing-as-aservice models accordingly. The utilization model of serviceoriented sensor networks not only greatly reduces the high costs of UWSNs, but also boost their overall development process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Implementation of Virtualization Concept for Sensor Networks</head><p>The concept of virtualization is applied to both terrestrial and underwater sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[186]</ref>. Generally, virtualiztion can be further classified into node and network-levels.</p><p>-Node-Level Virtualization: The node-level virtualization is a low-level technique that aims to virtualize the resources of a single node. Thus, these softwarized hardware resources can be shared among multiple applications by executing multiple tasks sequential or concurrently, in which corresponding tasks are executed either by sensor node OS, middleware or virtual sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>This level of virtualization primarily focuses on physical resources of a single node in order to increase the utilization efficiency of node-level resources. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, a lowlevel resource scheduler, which is called Wireless Hypervisor, is proposed based on this concept. In addition to that, as it focuses on physical layer virtualization, SDR can easily be integrated into it to enable reconfiguration ability. Furthermore, with such integration, it is easier to implement effective tools to support and manage multi-modal modems (e.g., acoustic, optical and EM) while jointly utilizing their advantages.</p><p>-Network-Level Virtualization: Based on the node-level virtualization, network-level virtualization is a higher level network resource abstraction mechanism. Unlike node-level virtualization to handle the resources of a single node, the network-level virtualization copes with the requirements of more complex applications by scheduling and allocating resources within the entire network in a cooperative manner to satisfy the demands of diverse applications. While virtualizing network resources, both slicing and merging techniques can be used. It is natural to merge multiple sensor networks into single or multiple virtualized networks (or virtual sensors) in order to have more network resources or dedicated sensing capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. As softwarized units, those virtual sensors abstract direct measurement activities of physical sensors, and therefore it is convenient to program those nodes for tailored virtual sensing.</p><p>For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, virtualized underwater sensors are implemented in a cluster-based underwater sensor network for detecting sparse events. Leveraging the fact that the locations of the events are sparsely distributed, compressive sensing is implemented on the virtual sensors in order to reconstruct event measurements for accurate detection with low sensing overhead. Similarly, the softwarized resources can also be partitioned or sliced into logically isolated virtual subset of networks, which will significantly improve resource efficiency and satisfy application diversity by running dedicated applications on those isolated virtual networks. Furthermore, via sophisticated resource scheduling schemes, the optimal utilization of network resources can be achieved while satisfying QoS requirements of each application.</p><p>A network-level resource management framework, called network hypervisor, is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Network hypervisor takes charge high-level scheduling and allocation of network resources based on the demands of each application which runs on sliced virtual networks. The aim of network hypervisor is to achieve optimized utilization of network resources while considering that the resources are spectrum, sensors, radio access options (e.g., acoustic, optical and EM), under the QoS requirements of different applications (e.g., data rate, energy consumption, sensing frequency and coverage).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. INTERNET OF UNDERWATER THINGS (IOUT) AND CLOUD COMPUTING</head><p>The Internet of Things (IoTs) emerges in order to connect and control smart things for providing Internet-based services, in which these intelligent things can be reached at any time in any place <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[187]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[188]</ref>. Based on IoTs, cloud computing enables on demand access to shared configurable computing resource pools in a convenient manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[189]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[190]</ref>. As cloud computing provides computation abstraction to accelerate sensor network data sharing, and to enable sensor-as-a-service or sensing-as-a-service oriented networks, it has been integrated to WSNs. For example, sensor-cloud is one of such creations, the concept of which manages connected sensors, data storage, processing and sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. Although most of the existing UWSNs currently are isolated from the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, these paradigms and concepts are on the way to be incorporated to UWSNs. In this section, we discuss the development and the advancement of these areas in UWSNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Basic Concept of IoUTs</head><p>The concept of IoUTs tries to connect all underwater sensors deployed in oceans, lakes, rivers and so on, in order to construct a grand underwater network to facilitate the digitization of those areas as well as resources utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Under the concept of IoUT, underwater smart things can be reached anywhere, anytime and by anyone in order to enhance the sharing of information. For example, via embedded sensors in those things, IoUT has the capability of sensing the environment in real-time continuously. Accordingly, the information gathered by those smart things enable information sharing services via cloud computing or AI technology.</p><p>In addition to that, the concept of IoUT greatly improve the ability to reach, manage and utilize the resources of sensor networks effectively and efficiently. For example, via Internet, both static and mobile sensor nodes can be reached, and then be reconfigured and reprogrammed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Keeping underwater things online also simplifies the network monitoring and diagnosing process as their status information can be logged and monitored in real-time.</p><p>The paramount benefit is derived from the fact that IoUTs transform the traditional application-oriented sensor networks to sensing-as-as-service networks. For example, the real-time ocean data, which are collected by floating underwater sinks or gateways, can be shared among different end-users around the world easily via the Internet. Furthermore, leveraging cloud computing, more complex data processing techniques can be used to produce high value information from huge volume of sensed data to serve more end-users. More importantly, coupled with the emerging technology, such as NFV, UWSNs can evolve towards sensing-service-oriented infrastructure, which provide on-demand services around the world via the Internet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Connection and Control of Underwater Things</head><p>To realize IoUTs, underwater things should firstly be connected to the Internet in real-time so that these devices can be reached and controlled remotely at any place and anytime. Several papers explored how to reach and control underwater IoTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. In the following, we introduce two approaches to reach and control underwater things, e.g., via gateways or the IP-based technique.</p><p>1) Gateway-based Approach: This approach uses communication gateways to reach and control underwater things. It is natural to use gateways to reach and control underwater things since they are usually mounted on floating buoys, ships or onshore stations, and are equipped with multiple communication models (e.g., acoustic, RF and optical), plenty of battery power as well as Internet connectivity. Gateway provides a common bridge to convert and transform different communication protocols to communicate with each other, and uses smart tunneling technologies to manage interactions among heterogeneous devices.</p><p>Several famous long-term sea-trial underwater network projects, such as SEAWEB, Ocean-TUNE and SUNRISE, are among the forefront research groups that use gateways to handle underwater things <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[191]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[192]</ref>. In a SEAWEB experiment on 2003, two Racom gateway nodes are tested to reach and control both static and mobile nodes successfully <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[191]</ref>. In Ocean-TUNE UCONN testbed, buoy nodes are equipped with multiple modems (e.g., RF, CDMA, OFDM and Teledyne Benthos) and act as gateways with unique IP address, which can be accessed via onshore computers <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[192]</ref>. Via a web-based GUI and an acoustic remote control module, underwater things can be remotely controlled and reprogrammed according to the requirements of different applications.</p><p>In SUNRISE project, an interface SUNRISE GATE is designed to connect, communicate and reconfigure heterogeneous underwater things in different testbeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[193]</ref>. SUNRISE GATE provides both low-level and high-level access for end-users. For low-level access, through a unified web interface, underwater devices can be reserved and monitored (e.g., positions and environmental conditions). SUNRISE GATE also provides high-level direct accessibility feature via a shell interface to conduct complex reconfigurations, such as modem firmware updating.</p><p>Gateway-based approach is easier to deploy, but it heavily depends on centralized communication techniques, which limit interoperability among nodes. Another problem is its scalability, i.e., as the number of nodes increases, the gateway may become a bottle-neck due to heavy traffic.</p><p>2) IP-based Approach: This approach directly connects underwater things to the Internet just like traditional IPbased networks. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, an IP-based approach is proposed, in which an adaptive IP-compatible layer enables commercial underwater devices for being capable of interoperating with traditional TCP/IP stacks. The adaptation layer resides in between the network layer and the link layer in order to keep the original IP-stack unaltered to the greatest extent.</p><p>The proposed network consists of two types of nodes, which are border routers and underwater nodes. The border routers are mounted on ships, buoys or onshore stations with direct Internet connectivity. The entire network is divided into multiple subsets, and there is one border router and multiple underwater nodes in each subset. With the help of the adaptation layer, the border router has one-hop virtual links to reach each of the underwater nodes in its subnet. However, these virtual links are originally realized via multi-hop interior mesh routing paths in order to reduce energy consumption and prevent interference with other nodes.</p><p>Similar to 6LowWPAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[194]</ref>, that makes terrestrial WSNs IPv6 compatible, the adaptation layer performs header compression as well as fragmentation. However, this scheme also takes underwater energy consumption and time-varying channel into consideration in order to infer optimal packet size. The proposed scheme is implemented and evaluated in commercial Teledyne Benthos modem (e.g., SM-75), and demonstrated the proof of achieving both energy efficiency and effective interoperability.</p><p>C. Cloud Computing for UWSNs 1) Basic Concept: As an emerging information technology, cloud computing was initially developed for Internet-based networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[195]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[196]</ref>, and later it was extended to wireless sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[197]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[198]</ref>. The adoption of cloud computing improves the performance of sensor networks in terms of energy efficiency, computing capability and service quality via service-oriented networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[199]</ref>. More recently, sensorcloud has been proposed to integrate sensor networks with cloud computing tightly in order to fulfill more complex service-oriented application requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[200]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[201]</ref>. Coupled with IoTs, cloud computing offers serviceoriented resources, such as hardware, software and sensed data in different geographical locations around the world to anyone who needs them. Furthermore, integrating other cloud computing paradigms (e.g., fog computing and edge computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[202]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[204]</ref>) into UWSNs pour new vitality for further development.</p><p>2) Benefits: As UWSNs suffer from severe resource constraints, such as limited computing power, memory and battery supply, applying cloud computing to UWSNs will bring several benefits as follows.</p><p>-Sensing as a Service: The Internet and cloud computing enable everything as a service in three service models, such as infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and software-</p><p>The common characteristic of those models is to reallocate resources (e.g., software, hardware and data) as a service. In sensor network domain, those models have other names, such as sensors-as-service or sensing-as-a-service. The goal of those models is to transform traditional sensor into service-oriented sensor networks by exploiting the capability of both IoUTs and distributed cloud computing platforms.</p><p>-Cost Effective Resource Sharing: Currently, both the deployment and the maintenance costs of UWSNs are extremely expensive. Consequently, cloud computing and network virtualization enable sharing of network resources, and more endusers are able to reach and use the infrastructure via multiple applications. Hence, the overall cost of underwater networks is significantly reduced. Furthermore, end-users do not require to worry about the details of underlying networks, so they can focus on the utilization of sensed data.</p><p>-Scalable Resource Management: While leveraging cloud connection, diverse UWSNs which are deployed in different geographical locations can be virtualized as a single resource pool. Hence, these softwarized and virtualized resources can be elastically allocated and released as required. Consequently, it is easier to control and optimize resource utilization under pre-defined requirements of different metrics.</p><p>-Analysis, Visualization and Trend Prediction: The powerful computing capacity of the cloud computing technique naturally compensates drawbacks of traditional sensor networks with constrained computing capacity and limited processing power. By connecting sensed data to cloud computing platforms, complex data analysis tools and visualization techniques can be used to facilitate the development of UWSNs. It is also possible to exploit AI-based techniques (e.g., deep learning) <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref> in order to improve real-time prediction capability.</p><p>3) Implementation: Integrating the Internet and cloud computing into UWSNs is relatively an emerging field, and we illustrate their recent development as follows.</p><p>-Early Cloud: At the early stage, the integration of cloud computing and sensor networks focuses on transferring sensed data to cloud computing platforms. This low-level integration primarily exploits cloud platforms as sensor data processing units and data sharing centers. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[206]</ref>, underwater sensed data is transferred to a cloud computing platform, and then the data is processed, visualized and accessed by end-users via network interfaces. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the surface sink acts as a gateway between sensor networks and cloud computing platform, and intelligent middlewares are responsible for the required management and interaction between them. In largescale UWSNs, if all the sensed data are transmitted to the cloud platform, the gateways may become a bottle neck in terms of high latency, high energy consumption and high traffic. To mitigate those problems, the fog computing and edge computing paradigms can be applied in UWSNs to allow most of the sensed data being processed firstly at where they are generated instead of sending all these sensed data to the remote data center for cloud computing.</p><p>-Sensor-Cloud: Sensor-cloud implements virtualization concept on the cloud computing platforms and decouples the network owners from the users, which results in the creation of virtual sensors from underlying physical sensors and hardware. Each virtual sensor is created from one or multiple physical sensors, while multiple virtual sensors form a big virtual sensor group. These virtual sensors are created or destroyed on demand as required. The virtual sensors are also programmable. Different from programmable underwater SDMs that focus on the reconfigurable physical and MAC layers, virtual sensors primarily provide programmability feature in order to satisfy on-demand application service requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>In this section, we first briefly summarize the softwaredefined technologies in this paper, and then discuss several future research directions.</p><p>A. Summary of Software-defined Technologies 1) Description of General Category: We generally categorize software-defined technologies in terms of three groups, i.e., node-level, network-level and application-level, according to their functions.</p><p>-Node-Level Technology: The node-level technology primarily solves the issues related to physical and MAC layers. SDR is such a node-level technique, which aims to empower sensor nodes with intelligence. Via this, sensor nodes have self-adaptation capability to deal with the dynamic changes of environments, and satisfy different demands of diverse applications (e.g., communication channel, multi-modal communication, multi-sensors and so on).</p><p>-Network-Level Technology: Network-level technologies are to improve the efficiency of network resources and simplify network management. Both SDN and NFV are network-level approaches. Naturally, the network-level techniques require the support of node devices. However, those devices are no longer real hardware assets, rather they are softwarized and virtualized entities that can be utilized and managed more conveniently.</p><p>-Application-Level Technology: The application-level technologies are to facilitate the versatile requirements of underwater applications, which are achieved by high-level abstractions of underlying software-defined architectures, such as SDN and NFV. Hence, end-users are just required to focus on well-defined APIs for implementing specific application policy engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[146]</ref>. Both IoUTs and cloud computing are considered as application-level technologies, which will propel conventional sensor networks to evolve towards sensing-as-aservice networks.</p><p>2) Programmability Analysis: One basic principle behind software-defined technologies is to improve network programmability <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">[207]</ref>, in which both the hardware and software of the network can be controlled and utilized fully to satisfy the requirements of different applications. From this point of view, all the software-defined technologies used in UWSNs, such as SDR, SDN and NFV, are the part of efforts to enable programmable UWSNs, in order to improve network flexibility, adaptivity, scalability, evolvability and resource utilization efficiency.</p><p>In a programmable network, most of the protocol stacks are implemented in software. However, in terms of programmability, these software-defined technologies have different priorities, which is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>. We use different colors to represent the programmability level from low to high, where green represents the highest degree and grey represents the lowest degree.</p><p>Generally, SDR-SDM mainly focuses on physical layer programmability, whereas SDR-CR concentrates on the programmability of MAC layer. Both the SDN and NFV paradigms deal with the programmability of network layer by abstracting network resources, and hence they are correlated to each other. However, they have different emphasis on different aspects of the network and have different primary goals accordingly.</p><p>SDN creates centralized network control abstractions with the aim to enhance network flexibility and simplify both network innovation and management. In contrast, NFV abstracts network functions and services from physical hardware resources in order to improve resource utilization efficiency. Both IoUTs and cloud computing (e.g., sensor-cloud) primarily focus on application layer programmability by providing well-defined APIs to accelerate network sharing as well as enable sensing-as-a-service oriented networks.</p><p>3) Analysis of Complementary Characteristics: Currently, most of the software-defined technologies have been developed individually. However, some of them have similarities, and are even complementary to each other. For example, both NFV and sensor-cloud aim at resource sharing, but NFV is in favor of infrastructure resource sharing while sensor-cloud concentrates on high level sensed data sharing.</p><p>Both the SDN and NFV are created to improve network flexibility and scalability in order to speed up application innovation and network evolution. However, they are not dependent on each other. As NFV decouples network functions from network hardware to implement sophisticated data-plane functionalities with the help of virtualization concept, they are complementary to each other. Therefore, they can be combined and integrated together for the implementation of better NFV, and simplify the operations that runn on software-defined networks. Additionally, multiple software-defined technologies may be complementary to each other. In such efforts, both SDR and NFV are integrated into the design of underwater software-defined networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[208]</ref>.</p><p>B. Future Directions 1) Integration of Complementary Software-Defined Architecture Design: Although software-defined techniques have different priorities at different layers in terms of OSI network model, some of them are also complementary to each other. Hence, integrating multiple techniques together and building novel architectures would significantly enhance the capability of those emerging technologies. However, as most of these technologies are isolatedly created and developed, when combining them together, more efforts should be made to prevent complications among different techniques, e.g., to modify, redesign part of them or make tradeoffs in order to design optimized and robust software-defined architectures.</p><p>Practically, since there is no one-fits-all architecture that satisfies the diverse application requirements, we advocate that software-defined architectures are the flexible ones to program the entire protocol stack from top to bottom fully. The top-down complementary software-defined architecture can be regarded as a novel transformation of modular-based architecture, which can be thoroughly programmed across the entire protocol stack, e.g., from the physical layer to the application layer, to satisfy the dynamic requirements of application services.</p><p>2) Cross-Layer Design: In order to achieve optimized network performance under harsh communication environments and resource-constrained underwater devices, crosslayer design is a well-accepted approach in UWSNs by making the lower layer information available to the higher layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[167]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[209]</ref>. This approach can be implemented in softwaredefined network architectures, and allows shared parameters or information transfer among the softwarized layers in order to execute optimized protocols or algorithms.</p><p>For example, a modular-based cross-layer approach, Cross-Flow, is proposed for terrestrial wireless radio networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[210]</ref>, which takes the advantages of the integrated SDR and SDN-based architecture. CrossFlow provides physical layer abstractions and interfaces for the centralized controller to manipulate in order to realize real-time reconfigurations of the underlying physical infrastructures. When such concept is used in UWSNs, the fact that underwater nodes may be equipped with multiple communication front-ends (e.g., acoustic, optical and EM) should be taken into account. Therefore, the controller has more options to select and control. Accordingly, the controller needs to collect and monitor multiple spatiotemporally varying channels state information in order to control the underlying infrastructures efficiently.</p><p>Currently, there is a research trend of integrating multiple software-defined techniques together in order to reap greater benefits from these integrations. As more technologies are integrated to each other, implementing a vertical cross-layer technique creates new challenges to be solved. For example, when combining SDN and sensor-cloud techniques together, the cross-layer design should consider the coordination of northbound APIs with the requirements of sensor-cloud applications.</p><p>3) Cognitive Oriented Sensor Networks: Currently, cognitive acoustic sensor networks primarily leverage SDR for the management of dynamic underwater spectrum. However, we advocate that underwater cognitive sensor networks should not be confined only to this area. This paradigm should be implemented towards smart sensor nodes as well as smart sensor networks. For example, by integrating information sensing, data analysis, decision making and execution of actions, we can develop cognitive-oriented self-adaptive intelligent sensor networks. With the help of cloud computing and IoUTs, the ultimate goal of cognitive paradigm is to bring the intelligent automated networks in reality.</p><p>4) AI Support Design: In the recent years, the development of AI is rapid in wireless networks, and AI-based technologies (e.g., machine learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning) have been used in wireless sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[211]</ref>. On the other hand, currently, underwater sensor nodes have more powerful computational capability, and hence it is the time to apply AI-based technologies to UWSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[212]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[213]</ref>. AI-based technologies would create new opportunities for UWSNs, and benefit both for software-defined sensor nodes and software-defined networks which enable more intelligent networks in the near future.</p><p>By integrating AI-based techniques into software-defined architectures or protocols design, sensor nodes will become smarter with real-time self-adaptation capability to cope with harsh ocean environments while targeting on the improvement of communication efficiency as well as the utilization of underwater spectrum intelligently. Implementing AI-based techniques such as reinforcement learning and deep learning into network layer architecture will increase network-level intelligence in terms of environmental adaptability and resource efficiency by pre-training networks with automatic extracted features from the targeted deployment area.</p><p>5) Evolution of Isolated Networks towards Service-Oriented Networks: As of today, most of the UWSNs are isolatedly developed and some networks are even used only for military applications. Accordingly, the network infrastructure and sensed data are forbidden to commercial utilization, which further hurdle the proliferation of underwater technologies for commercial market. As IoUTs are the primary foundations to develop smart ocean, the potential demand of commercial is surging. However, until now, UWSNs still lack the capability to meet such demands.</p><p>Therefore, it might be both economically beneficial and practical to enlarge the limited commercial market by transforming the conventional underwater networks towards service-oriented networks. Since both the assets and maintenance costs of underwater networks are currently extremely high, developing open and shared service-oriented networks is expected to reduce the necessary cost for scientific or commercial utilization significantly.</p><p>Technically, service-oriented networks require openness of both the network infrastructure and the sensed data. Therefore, we need to exploit the potential power of these emerging software-defined techniques, and conquer urgent problems along the road towards realizing sensing-as-a-service networks. For example, a service-oriented UWSN requires network standardization to enhance the interoperability of underwater communication assets. Implementing software-defined technologies in physical layer will greatly enhance the interoperability of underwater modems. Supported by NATO, JANUS is also a standardization effort to develop an international standard underwater communication language <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[134]</ref>. Other techniques such as sensor-cloud also needs further efforts to accelerate the transformation of traditional networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we presented a survey on software-defined technologies of UWSNs (via programming all layers of OSI model), which include SDR (e.g., SDM and software-defined CR), network virtualization, software-defined networks, IoUTs and cloud computing. While describing each of these technologies, we highlight that programmability is a feature which can be used for increasing network flexibility and adaptability. Among these technologies, SDMs have been studied for many years. However, we argue that many of the recently emerging software-defined technologies, such as CR, NFV, SDN and sensor-cloud, provide potential opportunities to tackle some inherent challenges of UWSNs.</p><p>Although these technologies have different programming priorities that aim at different layers, some of them are complementary to each other. Leveraging this characteristic, those techniques can be combined together to design softwaredefined cross-layer programmable networks with improved resource utilization efficiency. We also discussed several research issues for future advancement in this domain. There is no doubt that these technologies will propel further development of UWSNs when researchers learn how to leverage their advantages and apply them to UWSNs. We hope that this paper will inspire and promote more research activities in this area, and we believe that the utilization of these novel softwaredefined technologies will significantly enhance the evolution of UWSNs towards the next-generation more sophisticated ones.  and GDUPS (2015), University of Macau Grant SRG2015-00050-FST.
