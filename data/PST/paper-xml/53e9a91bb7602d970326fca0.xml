<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Multiple transmit antennas in a downlink channel can provide tremendous capacity (i.e. multiplexing) gains, even when receivers have only single antennas. However, receiver and transmitter channel state information is generally required. In this paper, a system where each receiver has perfect channel knowledge, but the transmitter only receives quantized information regarding the channel instantiation is analyzed. The well known zero forcing transmission technique is considered, and simple expressions for the throughput degradation due to finite rate feedback are derived. A key finding is that the feedback rate per mobile must be increased linearly with the SNR (in dB) in order to achieve the full multiplexing gain, which is in sharp contrast to point-to-point MIMO systems in which it is not necessary to increase the feedback rate as a function of the SNR.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In multiple antenna broadcast (downlink) channels, capacity can be tremendously increased by adding antennas at only the access point <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In essence, an access point (AP) equipped with M antennas can support downlink rates up to a factor of M times larger than a single antenna access point, even when each mobile device has only a single antenna <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . In order to realize these benefits, however, the access point must:</p><p>Simultaneously transmit to multiple users over the same bandwidth (orthogonal schemes such as TDMA or CDMA are generally highly sub-optimal).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Obtain accurate channel state information (CSI).</head><p>Practical transmission structures that allow for simultaneous transmission to multiple mobiles, such as downlink beamforming, do exist. The requirement that the AP have accurate CSI, however, is far more difficult to meet, particularly in frequency division duplexed (FDD) systems. Training can be used to obtain channel knowledge at each of the mobile devices, but obtaining CSI at the AP generally requires feedback from each mobile. Such feedback channels do exist in current systems (e.g., for power control), but the required rate of feedback is clearly an important quantity for system designers.</p><p>In this paper, we consider the practically motivated finite rate feedback model, in which each mobile feeds back a finite number of bits regarding its channel instantiation at the beginning of each block or frame. This model was first considered for point-to-point MIMO channels in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> [4] <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, where the transmitter uses such feedback to more accurately direct its transmitted energy towards the receiver's antenna array, and even a small number of bits per antenna can be quite beneficial <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In point-to-point MIMO channels, the level of CSI available at the transmitter only affects the SNR-offset; it does not affect the slope of the capacity vs. SNR curve, i.e., the multiplexing gain. However, the level of CSI available to the transmitter does affect the multiplexing gain of the MIMO downlink channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As a result, channel feedback is considerably more important for MIMO downlink channels than for point-to-point channels.</p><p>In contrast to most recent work on the MIMO downlink channel which has primarily concentrated on channels with a very large number of mobiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> [9], we consider systems in which the number of mobiles is equal to the number of transmit antennas. This regime is applicable for inherently smaller systems, as well as large systems in which stringent delay constraints do not allow a small subset of users to be selected for transmission. Random beamforming is an alternative limited feedback strategy for MIMO downlink channels in which each mobile feeds back a very low rate quantization of the channel (log 2 M bits) as well as an analog SNR value <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. While this strategy performs well when there are a large number of mobiles relative to the number of transmit antennas, it performs poorly in the small system regime which we consider.</p><p>In this work we propose a simple downlink transmission scheme that uses zero-forcing precoding in conjunction with finite rate feedback. We consider systems in which each mobile performs vector quantization on its channel realization using random quantization codebooks, i.e. random vector quantization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Our key findings are:</p><p>The throughput of a feedback-based zero-forcing system is bounded if the SNR is taken to infinity and the number of feedback bits per mobile is kept fixed.</p><p>The number of feedback bits per mobile (B) must be increased linearly with the SNR (in dB) at the rate B = (M 1) log 2 P = (M 1) log 2 10 10 P dB M 1 3 P dB in order to achieve the full multiplexing gain of M . In addition, this scaling of B guarantees that the throughput loss relative to perfect CSIT-based zero-forcing is upper bounded by M bps/Hz, which corresponds to a 3 dB power offset.</p><p>Scaling the number of feedback bits according to B = log 2 P for any &lt; M 1 results in a strictly inferior multiplexing gain of M M 1 .</p><p>In essence, the channel estimation error at the access point must scale as the inverse of the SNR in order to allow the full multiplexing gain to be achieved, which results in the required linear scaling of feedback.</p><p>As a result of this scaling, feedback requirements are considerably higher in downlink channels than in point-to-point MIMO channels, which will have considerable design implications.</p><p>The MIMO downlink finite-rate feedback model was also considered independently by Ding, Love,</p><p>and Zoltowski <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we describe the channel model and the finite rate feedback mechanism. In Section III we provide background material on MIMO downlink capacity, downlink precoding, and random vector quantization. In Section IV we described the proposed zero-forcing based system, and analyze the throughput of this system in Section V. We provide numerical results comparing finite-rate feedback systems to alternative transmission techniques in Section VI, and close by discussing conclusions and possible extensions of this work in Section VII.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>We consider a K receiver multiple antenna broadcast channel in which the transmitter (access point, or AP) has M &gt; 1 antennas and each receiver has a single antenna. The broadcast channel is mathematically described as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y i = h y i x + n i ; i = 1; : : : ; K<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where h 1 ; h 2 ; : : : ; h K are the channel vectors (with h i 2 C M 1 ) of users 1 through K, the vector</p><p>x 2 C M 1 is the transmitted signal, and n 1 ; : : : ; n K are independent complex Gaussian noise terms with </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H y = [h 1 h 2 h K ], i.e.</formula><p>H is K M with the i-th row equal to the channel of the i-th receiver (h y i ). In order to focus our efforts on the impact of imperfect CSI, we consider a system where the number of mobiles is equal to the number of transmit antennas, i.e., K = M . However, this work can be combined with so-called user selection algorithms for systems with more mobiles than antennas (K &gt; M ), as studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The channel is assumed to be block fading, with independent fading from block to block. The entries of the channel matrices are distributed as iid unit variance complex Gaussians (Rayleigh fading). Furthermore, each of the receivers is assumed to have perfect and instantaneous knowledge of its own channel vector, i.e. h i . Notice it is not required for mobiles to know the channel of other mobiles. Partial CSI is acquired at the transmitter via a finite rate feedback channel from each of the mobiles, as described below.</p><p>In the finite rate feedback model shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> each receiver quantizes its channel (with h i assumed to be known perfectly at the i-th receiver) to B bits and feeds back the bits perfectly and instantaneously to the access point, which is assumed to have no other knowledge of the instantaneous state of the channel.</p><p>The quantization is performed using a vector quantization codebook that is known at the transmitter and the receivers. A quantization codebook C consists of 2 B M -dimensional unit norm vectors C , fw 1 ; : : : ; w 2 B g, where B is the number of feedback bits per mobile. Similar to point-to-point MIMO systems, each receiver quantizes its channel to the quantization vector that is closest to its channel vector, where closeness is measured in terms of the angle between two vectors or equivalently the inner product <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Thus, user i computes quantization index F i according to: </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F i =</formula><p>and feeds this index back to the transmitter. Note that only the direction of the channel vector is quantized, and no information regarding the channel magnitude is conveyed to the transmitter. Magnitude information can be used to perform power and rate loading across multiple channels, but this generally of secondary concern when the number of mobiles is the same as the number of antennas. If there are more users than antennas (i.e. K &gt; M ), however, channel magnitude information can be used to assist with the user selection process <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Clearly, the choice of vector quantization codebook significantly affects the quality of the CSI provided to the access point. In this work, we analyze performance using random vector quantization (RVQ), in which an ensemble of random quantization codebooks is considered. Details of RVQ are discussed in Section III-C.</p><p>Notation: We use boldface to denote vectors and matrices and A y refers to the conjugate transpose, or Hermitian, of A. The notation jjxjj refers the Euclidean norm of the vector x, and \(x; y) refers to the angle between vectors x and y with the standard convention j cos(\(x; y))j = jx y yj=(jjxjj jjyjj).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Capacity Results for MIMO Broadcast Channels</head><p>In this section we summarize relevant capacity results for the multiple-antenna broadcast channel.</p><p>When perfect CSI is available at transmitter and receivers, the capacity region of the channel is achieved by dirty-paper coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> [1] <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> [16] <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which is a technique that can be used to pre-cancel multiuser interference at the transmitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this paper we study the total system throughput, or the sum rate, which we denote as C sum (H; P ). At high SNR, the sum rate capacity of the MIMO BC can be approximated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C sum T X=RX CSI (H; P ) M log (P ) + c (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where c is a constant depending on the channel realization H. The key feature to notice is that capacity grows linearly as a function of M . Though the K (total) receive antennas are distributed amongst K receivers, the linear growth is the same as in a M -transmit, K-receive antenna point-to-point MIMO system, i.e. both systems have the same multiplexing gain.</p><p>If each of the mobiles suffers from fading according to the same distribution and the transmitter has no instantaneous CSI, the situation is very different. In this scenario, the channels of all receivers are statistically identical, and thus the channel is degraded, in any order. Therefore, any codeword receiver 1 can decode can also be decoded by any other receiver, which implies that a TDMA strategy is optimal [20, Section VI] <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Thus, the sum capacity of this channel is equal to the capacity of the point-to-point channel from the transmitter to any individual receiver:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">C sum RX CSI = E h1 log 1 + P M jjh 1 jj 2 ;<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and therefore the multiplexing gain of this channel is only one. In fact, the downlink channel achieves a multiplexing gain of only one for any fading distribution (i.e., for any distribution on the magnitude of the channel) in which the spatial direction of each channel is isotropically distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This includes a downlink channel in which users have unequal average SNR but each suffers from spatially uncorrelated Rayleigh fading.</p><p>There clearly is a huge gap between the capacity of the MIMO downlink channel with transmitter CSI (multiplexing gain of M ) and without transmitter CSI (multiplexing gain of 1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Downlink Precoding</head><p>Though dirty paper coding is capacity achieving for the MIMO broadcast channel, the technique requires considerable complexity and practical implementations are still being actively pursued <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>As a result, simpler downlink transmission schemes are of obvious interest. One such scheme is downlink beamforming <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , which incurs a rate/power loss relative to DPC but achieves the same multiplexing gain of M . In order to implement this scheme, the transmitter multiplies the symbol intended for each receiver by a beamforming vector and transmits the sum of these vector signals. Let s i denote the scalar symbol intended for the i-th receiver, and let v i denote the corresponding unit norm beamforming vector. The transmitted signal is then given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x = K X j=1 v j s j ;<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The received signal at user i is therefore given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">y i = h y i x + n i = K X j=1 h y i v j s j + n i ;<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and the SINR at mobile i is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">SIN R i = P M jh y i v i j 2 1 + P j6 =i P M jh y i v j j 2 ; (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>under the assumption that each of the symbols has power P=M , and that no interference cancellation is performed at the mobiles. Note that the capacity-achieving strategy is similar to downlink beamforming with the addition of a pre-coding step at the transmitter which leads to the elimination of some of the multi-user interference terms in the SINR expression.</p><p>The performance of downlink beamforming clearly depends on the choice of beamforming vectors, but the problem of determining the sum rate maximizing beamforming vectors is generally very difficult. One simple choice of beamforming vectors are the zero-forcing vectors, which are chosen such that no multiuser interference is experienced at any of the receivers. This can be done by choosing the beamforming vector of user i orthogonal to the channel vectors of all other users, i.e., by choosing v i orthogonal to h j for all i 6 = j. It is easily seen that the zero-forcing beamforming vectors are simply the normalized columns of the inverse of the concatenated channel matrix H. If such beamforming vectors are used, the received signal at the i-th mobile reduces to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">y i = h y i x + n i = K X j=1 h y i v j s j + n i = h y i v i s i + n i<label>(8)</label></formula><p>because h y i v j = 0 for all j 6 = i by construction. Since all interference has been eliminated, the corresponding SNR is given as SN R i = P M jh y i v i j 2 . In fact, zero-forcing is optimal amongst all downlink beamforming strategies at asymptotically optimal at high SNR <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Since zero-forcing creates M independent and parallel channels, the resulting multiplexing gain is equal to M , which is the same as for the capacity-achieving DPC strategy. Zero forcing does however, incur a rate loss (or alternatively, a power loss) relative to capacity. At high SNR, the power loss of zero forcing relative to DPC converges to 3 log 2 e M P M 1 j=1 j M j dB, which is approximately equal to 3 log 2 M dB <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Clearly, the transmitter must have perfect channel knowledge in order to choose the zero-forcing beamforming vectors. If there is any imperfection in this knowledge, there inevitably will be some multiuser interference, which leads to performance degradation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Random Vector Quantization</head><p>In this work we use random vector quantization (RVQ), in which each of the 2 B quantization vectors is independently chosen from the isotropic distribution on the M -dimensional unit sphere. We analyze performance averaged over all such choices of random codebooks, in addition to averaging over the fading distribution. Random codebooks are used because the optimal vector quantizer for this problem is not known in general, and known bounds are rather loose. RVQ, on the other hand, is very amenable to analysis and also performs measurably close to optimal quantization, as is shown in Section V-D. Note that each receiver is assumed to use a different and independently generated quantization codebook; if a common codebook was used, there would be a non-zero probability that multiple users return the same quantization vector, which complicates transmission.</p><p>Random vector quantization was first used to analyze the performance of CDMA and point-to-point MIMO channels with finite rate feedback, and has been shown to be asymptotically optimal in the large system limit (e.g., infinitely many antennas) <ref type="bibr">[10] [11]</ref>. There has also been very recent work characterizing the error performance of point-to-point MISO (multiple-input, single-output) systems utilizing RVQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>We now review some basic results on RVQ from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that will be useful in later derivations. As stated earlier, the quantization vectors are iid isotropic vectors on the M -dimensional unit sphere, as are the channel directions hi , hi jjhijj due to the assumption of iid Rayleigh fading. The most important quantity of interest is the statistical distribution of the quantization error. In order to determine this, first consider the inner product between a channel vector and a quantization vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">jw y j h i j 2 = jjh i jj 2 w y j hi 2 = jjh i jj 2 cos 2 \( hi ; w j ) :</formula><p>Because hi and w j are independent isotropic vectors, the quantity jw y j hi j 2 = cos 2 \( hi ; w j ) is beta distributed with parameters 1 and M 1, and sin 2 \( hi ; w j ) = 1 cos 2 (\(h i ; w j )) is beta distributed with parameters M 1 and 1. Thus the CDF of X = sin 2 \( hi ; w j ) is given by Pr</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(X x) = x M 1 .</formula><p>Let ĥi denote the quantization of the vector h i , i.e. the solution to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Since the quantization vectors are independent, the quantization error Z , sin 2 \( hi ; ĥi ) is the minimum of 2 B independent beta (M 1; 1) random variables, and the CCDF of Z is given by Pr</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(Z z) = (1 z M 1 ) 2 B [26, Lemma 1]</formula><p>. The expectation of this quantity has been computed in closed form <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">E H;W h sin 2 \( hi ; ĥi ) i = 2 B 2 B ; M M 1 :<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Here we use ( ) to denote the beta function, which is defined in terms of the gamma function as <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The gamma function is the extension of the factorial function to non-integers, and satisfies the fundamental properties (n) = (n 1)! for positive integers and (x + 1) = x (x) for all x <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. While the derivation of the expectation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> depends on the Pochmann symbol, this result can alternatively be derived using an integral representation of the beta function, as shown in Appendix I. Furthermore, a simple extension of inequalities given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> gives a strict upper bound to the expected quantization error:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">(x; y) = (x) (y) (x+y)</formula><p>Lemma 1: The expected quantization error can be upper bounded as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">E H;W h sin 2 \( hi ; ĥi ) i &lt; 2 B M 1 : Proof: See Appendix II.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Point-to-Point MISO Systems with Finite Rate Feedback</head><p>In this section we briefly review some basic results on point-to-point MISO systems (i.e., M transmit antennas, single receive antenna, which is equivalent to the given system model with K = 1) with finite rate feedback, under the assumption of iid Rayleigh fading. If the transmitter has perfect CSI, it is well known that the optimum transmission strategy is to beamform along the channel vector h <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and the corresponding (ergodic) capacity is C CSIT (P ) = E h log 1 + P jjhjj 2 . If the transmitter has no CSIT and only has knowledge of the fading distribution, the optimum transmission strategy is to transmit independent and equal power signals from each of the M transmit antennas, and the corresponding capacity is C no-CSIT (P ) = E h log 1 + P M jjhjj 2 . Clearly C no-CSIT (P ) = C CSIT ( P M ), which corresponds to a 10 log 10 M dB shift in the capacity curve. Thus the lack of CSIT leads to a 10 log 10 M dB SNR loss relative to perfect CSIT.</p><p>Providing the transmitter with partial CSIT via a finite rate feedback channel can be used to reduce this SNR loss. If the transmitter acquires CSIT through the finite rate feedback channel, an optimal or nearly optimal strategy is to beamform in the direction of the quantization vector 4 . The average rate achieved with this strategy assuming RVQ is used is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">R F B (P ) = E h;W h log 1 + P jjhjj 2 cos 2 \(h; ĥ) i E h h log 1 + P jjhjj 2 (1 2 B M 1 )</formula><p>i ;</p><p>where we have based the approximation on the upper bound given in Lemma 1, which is numerically very accurate. Thus, the use of limited feedback leads to an SNR degradation of approximately 10 log 10 (1 4 Conditions for the optimality of beamforming along the quantization direction are provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Though these conditions are difficult to analytically compute for most quantization codebooks, it is generally well accepted that beamforming performs extremely close to capacity. ) dB relative to perfect CSIT. Note that this approximation agrees with the expression derived for an asymptotically large number of transmit antennas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. If B = M 1 for example, a finite rate feedback system is expected to perform within about 3 dB of a perfect CSIT system. The capacity with CSIT, no CSIT, and finite rate feedback with B = M 1 = 3 is shown for a 4 1 MISO system in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Notice that there is a 6 dB gap between the CSIT and no CSIT curves, while the finite rate feedback curve is 2.7 dB from the perfect CSIT curve, which is quite close to our approximation of 3 dB.</p><p>The key point to take from this discussion is that the feedback load need not be increased as a function of SNR in order to maintain a constant power or rate gap relative to the perfect CSIT capacity curve. This is perhaps not surprising, since the amount of feedback only affects the cos 2 \(h; ĥ) term and thus leads to only a SNR degradation. Furthermore, also note that the multiplexing gain (i.e., the slope of the capacity curve) is not affected by the level of CSIT. For the MIMO downlink channel, however, the multiplexing gain of a M -transmit antenna, K user system is min(N; K) when there is perfect CSIT, but is only 1 if there is no CSIT. Clearly such a channel will be considerably more sensitive to the accuracy of the CSIT obtained through the finite rate feedback channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DOWNLINK PRECODING WITH FINITE RATE FEEDBACK</head><p>After the transmitter has received feedback bits from each of the K receivers, an appropriate multi-user transmission strategy must be chosen. We propose using zero-forcing beamforming based on the channel quantizations available at the transmitter. Zero-forcing (ZF) is a low complexity transmission scheme that can be implemented by a simple linear precoder, and its performance is optimal amongst the set of all linear precoders at asymptotically high SNR <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We later provide numerical results describing the performance of regularized zero-forcing precoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which outperforms pure zero-forcing at low SNR's but is equivalent to ZF at asymptotically high SNR.</p><p>Note that dirty paper coding cannot be directly applied in this scenario because of the imperfection in CSIT. In order to implement DPC, the transmitter in fact requires knowledge of the multi-user interference at the receiver, and not at the transmitter. The received interference clearly depends on the channel state, which is not known perfectly at the transmitter in the finite rate feedback model. The transmitter could estimate the received interference based on the available channel quantization, but even this estimated interference cannot be cancelled perfectly using DPC due to the transmitter's imperfect knowledge of the received signal power. In order to implement DPC, the transmitter must also know the received SNR (in the absence of any interference) in order to properly select the inflation factor, which is a key component in the dirty paper coding implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Since the SNR also depends on the channel realization, the transmitter only has an imperfect estimate of the SNR and thus cannot properly select the inflation factor.</p><p>When the transmitter has perfect CSI, zero-forcing can be used to completely eliminate multi-user interference by precoding transmission by the inverse of the channel matrix H. This creates a parallel, non-interfering channel to each of the M receivers, and thus leads to a multiplexing gain of M . In the finite rate feedback setting, the imperfection in CSIT makes it impossible to completely eliminate all multi-user interference, but a zero-forcing based strategy can still be quite effective. Since the transmitter only has knowledge of the channel quantizations but does not have any information regarding the magnitude or spatial direction of the quantization error, a reasonable approach to take is to select beamforming vectors according to the zero-forcing criterion based on the channel quantizations.</p><p>Let ĥi refer to the quantized version of the mobile i's channel.

Preliminary Calculations</head><p>In this section we prove a few useful results regarding the distribution of terms in the SINR expression in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. For the remainder of this paper, we use hi to denote the normalized channel vector, i.e., hi = h i =jjh i jj. Using this notation, we can rewrite the SINR as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">SIN R i = P M jjh i jj 2 j hy i v i j 2 1 + P j6 =i P M jjh i jj 2 j hy i v j j 2 :<label>(12)</label></formula><p>We first characterize the numerator of this expression, i.e., the received signal power:</p><p>Lemma 2: The beamforming vector v i is isotropically distributed in C M and is independent of the channel direction hi as well as the channel quantization ĥi .</p><p>Proof: By the zero-forcing procedure, v i is chosen in the nullspace of f ĥj g j6 =i .

Now consider the normalized channel vector h2 . Since RVQ is used, the quantization error has no preferential direction, i.e. the error is isotropically distributed in C M . Thus, conditioned on the magnitude of the quantization error a , sin 2 \( hi ; ĥi ) , the channel direction can be written as the sum of two vectors, one in the direction of the quantization, and the other isotropically distributed in the nullspace of the quantization:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">h2 = p 1 a ĥ2 + p as,</formula><p>where s is isotropically distributed in the nullspace of ĥ2 , and is independent of a.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Increasing Feedback Quality</head><p>In the previous section we studied systems with fixed feedback rates, and showed that the throughputs of such systems are bounded. In this section we show that this interference-limited behavior can be avoided by scaling the feedback rate linearly with the SNR (in dB). In fact, if the feedback rate is scaled at the appropriate rate, the full multiplexing gain of M is achievable. In addition to achieving the full multiplexing gain, it is also desirable to maintain a constant rate offset between the rates achievable with zero-forcing with perfect CSI and with finite-rate feedback. Note that if a bounded rate gap is maintained, the full multiplexing gain is also achieved. The following theorem specifies a sufficient scaling of feedback bits to maintain a bounded rate gap: </p><p>With this scaling of feedback bits, we clearly have R(P ) &lt; log 2 b for all P , as desired.</p><p>The rate offset of log 2 b (per user) can easily be translated into a power offset, which is a more useful metric from the design perspective.

RVQ vs. Optimal Vector Quantization</head><p>Given the previous sections results, an important issue to consider is the possible performance loss incurred by use of random vector quantization instead of an optimal vector quantizer. In this section we derive an upper bound to the bit savings that can result from using optimum vector quantization, and find that the RVQ penalty is actually very small. This is in accordance with results on the optimality of RVQ for point-to-point MIMO and MISO systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In order to determine the sub-optimality of RVQ, we utilize a lower bound to the quantization error of any vector quantization codebook developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>:</p><p>Lemma 5: Consider an arbitrary B-bit quantization codebook fw 1 ; : : : ; w 2 B g, and let the random variable Y denote the quantization error Y = sin 2 (\( hi ; ĥi )).

If the feedback is scaled in order to maintain a 3 dB gap from perfect CSI zero forcing, the noise and interference term are kept bounded by two (which corresponds to 3 dB). The lower bound, on the other hand, would be 1 + M 1 M instead of 2. For M = 5, this corresponds to 2.55 dB, or a 0.45 dB advantage relative to RVQ.

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON</head><p>In this section we present numerical results comparing the throughput achieved with finite rate feedback and two alternative transmission techniques for the MIMO downlink, random beamforming and TDMA.</p><p>Because regularized ZF outperforms ZF at all SNR's, we only consider regularized ZF systems.</p><p>Random beamforming is an extension of opportunistic beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to the multiple antenna downlink <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The transmitter randomly chooses M orthogonal beamforming vectors and transmits pilot symbols along these vectors. Each mobile measures the SINR of each beamforming vector, and feeds back the index of the vector with the highest SINR (requiring log 2 M bits), along with the corresponding SINR. The access point then transmits to the best user on each of the beamforming vectors. The required feedback per mobile is quite small (log 2 M bits plus an analog SNR value, which will presumably be sufficiently quantized), but this scheme does not perform well in systems with a moderate number of TDMA, in which the access point serves a single user at a time, is perhaps the simplest downlink transmission scheme. We consider the TDMA throughput achievable with perfect CSIT, in which the access point transmits (using the capacity-achieving beamforming strategy) to only the user with the largest SNR. While it is possible to incorporate the effect of finite-rate feedback into a TDMA system (as described in Section III-D), the effect is relatively negligible at the feedback levels considered here and thus for simplicity we consider perfect CSIT. Since a TDMA system achieves a multiplexing gain of only one, we expect to see a significant throughput degradation if TDMA is used, particularly at high SNR. However, note that the difference between the sum capacity of the MIMO downlink (achieved by DPC) and the achievable TDMA throughput is not particularly large at SNR's less than 5 or 10 dB <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> plots achievable throughput for a finite-rate feedback system with B scaled to maintain a 3 dB offset (equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">19</ref>)), TDMA, and random beamforming, in a 4 4 channel. Finite-rate feedback outperforms random BF beyond 5 dB, which is not surprising given that the feedback level per mobile (which is given by B = P dB for this particular channel) is significantly higher than for random BF.</p><p>Finite-rate feedback and TDMA give approximately the same throughput up to 10 dB, after which the feedback system begins to significantly outperform TDMA, due to the superior multiplexing gain of the zero-forcing system.

Here we see that TDMA is a better choice than finite-rate feedback with either 5 or 10 bits of feedback per mobile.

The throughput achieved with scaled feedback is considerably larger than the TDMA throughput, due to the large number of spatial degrees of freedom used by the zero-forcing system. The 20 feedback bit system outperforms TDMA at moderate SNR's, but hits the interference limited regime around 15 or 20 dB.</p><p>In general, finite-rate feedback based zero-forcing outperforms TDMA at SNR's above 5 or 10 dB if the feedback per mobile is sufficiently large, but does not provide a significant advantage at low SNR's.</p><p>Furthermore, random beamforming is outperformed by both TDMA and finite-rate feedback at essentially all SNR levels.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The use of multi-user MIMO techniques can significantly increase downlink throughput without requiring large numbers of antennas at each mobile device. However, it is crucial that the transmitter have accurate channel state information in order to realize these gains. In fact, the availability of channel state information appears to be the critical issue that will determine the feasibility of multi-user MIMO techniques in future wireless communication systems.</p><p>We investigated the finite-rate feedback model, in which each mobile quantizes its channel realization to a finite number of bits that are fed back to the transmitter. Although this model has been extensively studied for point to point MIMO channels, conclusions are quite different in the multi-user setting. Our primary result showed that the number of feedback bits per mobile must be increased linearly with the SNR (in dB) in order to realize multi-user MIMO benefits. As a result of this, feedback levels are quite high in MIMO downlink channels: in a 4 antenna system, for example, each mobile must feed back 10 bits at an overall system SNR of 10 dB. In contrast, feedback does not need to scale with SNR in point to point MIMO systems, and even a relatively small number of bits (e.g., 4 or 5) can be very beneficial at all SNR levels. This scaling relationship is particularly troublesome because multi-user MIMO techniques are generally most beneficial in the high SNR regime.</p><p>The intuition for the extreme sensitivity of the MIMO downlink channel to imperfection in CSIT, as compared to point-to-point MIMO channels, is actually quite straightforward. In point-to-point MIMO channels, imperfect CSIT leads to mismatch between the input and the transmission modes of the channel and thus some "wasted" transmission power (e.g., power that is transmitted into the nullspace of the channel), which reduces the received SNR but has no other deleterious effect. In a MIMO downlink channel, imperfect CSIT also leads to mismatch between the input and the channel, but the effect of this is increased multi-user interference, which is significantly more harmful than a reduction in desired signal power.</p><p>There are, however, a number of reasons to be optimistic regarding the issue of CSI feedback in downlink channels. First note that we have considered only the most basic iid Rayleigh block fading model, and feedback rates can surely be decreased by exploiting spatial and temporal correlation inherent in any physical fading process, as has already been extensively studied for point to point MIMO channels <ref type="bibr">[35] [36]</ref> [37] <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Furthermore, recent work has shown that a small number of mobile antennas can be used to significantly improve quantization quality and thereby decrease the required feedback rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, it may also be possible to exploit multi-user diversity effects and thereby reduce feedback rates in systems with a large number of mobiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> [13] <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Within this body of work, one interesting idea is to have only a subset of mobiles (e.g., mobiles meeting a fixed SNR threshold) feed back their channel information <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> [41] <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. While this technique can significantly reduce the total number of feedback bits to be transmitted, it also requires contention-based feedback (i.e., random access), which can lead to throughput reduction as well as additional latency on the feedback channels. Although we have considered only digital feedback methods, analog feedback appears to have a number of attractive properties for the downlink channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> [43] <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. A careful comparison of analog and digital techniques remains to be performed.</p><p>We close by mentioning a few important issues not considered in this work. One key assumption made in this work is that the channel feedback is instantaneous. Of course, there will be some non-zero delay associated with transmitting feed back bits from the mobiles to the access point, and this delay can be quite significant in fast fading (large Doppler spread) channels. In fact, numerical results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> indicate that feedback delay can severely limit the performance of certain downlink transmission schemes at even moderate levels of Doppler. In addition, each mobile is assumed to have perfect CSI, while there will be non-zero receiver estimation error in any practical system. This will clearly lead to additional imperfection  </p><p>The final step follows because</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">log 2 1 + P M jh y i v i j 2 log 2 0 @ 1 + P M jh y i v i j 2 + P M X j6 =i jh y i v j j 2<label>1</label></formula><p>A log 2 1 + P jjh i jj 2 ;</p><p>and the multiplexing gain of the upper and lower bounds are easily shown to be one.</p><p>We first show that m M 1 (using L = 2 B = P ): </p><formula xml:id="formula_50">E H;W<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_51">log 2 P 1 M 1 log 2 L + O(1) = 1 M 1 log 2 P + O(1)</formula><p>where we have used Lemma 4 to evaluate the expectation of the logarithm of the interference term.</p><p>Plugging this bound in to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> gives m M M 1 .</p><p>To show m M M 1 , we upper bound the limit in (23) using the fact that j hy i v j j 2 sin 2 ( hi ; ĥi )</p><p>for any i 6 = j (from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">13</ref>)) and Jensen's inequality: </p><formula xml:id="formula_52">E H;W<label>2</label></formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2 B M 1</head><label>21</label><figDesc>Fig. 2. 4 x 1 MISO System with CSIT, No CSIT, &amp; Feedback</figDesc></figure>

As stated in Section III-C, Z is the minimum of 2 B beta (M 1; 1) random variables with CCDF given by: Pr(Z z) = (1 z M 1 ) L , where L = 2 B . We wish to compute E[log e Z], or equivalently E[ log e Z]. Since 0 Z 1, the random variable log e Z is non-negative with support [0; 1). Using the fact that E[X] = R Pr(X x)dx for non-negative random variables and the binomial expansion, we have: E[ log e Z] = Z Pr( log e Z z)dz = Z Pr(Z e z )dz = Z 1 e z(M 1) ) L dz = where the final line follows from [49, Section 0.155]. We multiply by log 2 e to translate to base 2, and thus get E[ log 2 Z] = log 2 e M . Using L = 2 B we get the subsequent bounds.
