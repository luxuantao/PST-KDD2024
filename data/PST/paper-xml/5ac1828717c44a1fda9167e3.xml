<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Proceedings of the IEEE 1 ABSTRACT | As small satellites become more popular and capable, strategies to provide in-space propulsion increase in importance. Applications range from orbital changes and maintenance, attitude control and desaturation of reaction wheels to drag compensation and de-orbit at spacecraft endof-life. Space propulsion can be enabled by chemical or electric means, each having different performance and scalability properties. The purpose of this review is to describe the working principles of space propulsion technologies proposed so far for small spacecraft. Given the size, mass, power, and operational constraints of small satellites, not all types of propulsion can be used and very few have seen actual implementation in space.</p><p>Emphasis is given in those strategies that have the potential of miniaturization to be used in all classes of vehicles, down to the popular 1-L, 1-kg CubeSats and smaller.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. IN T RODUC T ION</head><p>Propulsion capability for satellites has been a priority for satellite developers since the early stages of spaceflight to increase spacecraft capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, with the first instances of electric propulsion (EP) occurring in 1964 onboard of the Russian Zond-2 carrying a Pulsed Plasma thruster <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the American SERT satellites with the first operation of an ion engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Significant other development highlights include the development of the Shell 405 catalyst allowing the utilization of high performance hydrazine-based chemical propulsion systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the SMART-1 mission showing the capability of an electric Hall thruster in an Earth-moon transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, as well as the interplanetary Deep Space-1 mission, which was propelled by an NSTAR ion engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. With the ABS-3A and Eutelsat 115 West B, we have seen the first instances of commercial platforms to use EP for orbit raising from a low earth orbit to the final geostationary orbit. However, while these missions Digital Object Identifier: 10.1109/JPROC.2017.2778747 have proven the high Δv capability of EP systems for traditional missions with high electrical power available, the recent trend toward miniaturization of spacecraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> has resulted in tightened requirements for EP systems in terms of mass, volume, and power consumption, while continuing to be competitive in terms of fuel efficiency, which is directly related to the system's capability to transform electric energy into kinetic energy of the exhaust.</p><p>This paper explores the different propulsion principles currently developed for small and miniaturized spacecraft. While designations for different satellite classes have been somehow ambiguous, a system-mass-based characterization approach will be used in this work, in which the term "small satellites" will refer to satellites with total masses below 500 kg, with "nanosatellites" for systems ranging from 1 to 10 kg, "picosatellites" with masses between 0.1 and 1 kg, and "femtosatellites" for spacecraft below 0.1 kg. In this category, the popular CubeSat standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> will, therefore, be characterized as nanosatellite, whereas Chipsats, Wafersats, and membrane-syle satellites <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> will be categorized as picosatellite or femtosatellite, depending on their mass and configuration.</p><p>Different satellite classes result in different power budgets available, as in a first approximation, available area for solar panels, as well as battery sizes decrease for decreasing satellite mass. Traditional mass-based power estimation approximations assume specific power per subsystem mass of 25-200 W/kg <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Assuming a mass fraction of 10% for the power subsystem, the available power for small satellites ranges from 1.25-10 kW to 25-200 W, whereas available power on nanosatellites would range from 25-100 down to 2.5-20 W and power levels for picosatellites and femtosatellites reduced by one and two orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to nanosatellites. However, densification and fast integration of highefficiency components have shown that these assumptions can significantly underestimate the performance of current nanosatellites, especiallcy CubeSats. For example, current state-of-the-art 3U CubeSats can achieve 50-60 W of total Beginning Of Life (BOL) power when using deployable solar sails <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The available power level can 2 Proceedings of the IEEE have significant impact on the propulsive capabilities of a satellite platform in the case of EP, both on the choice of thruster principle as well as the resulting propulsive performance.</p><p>Propulsion is an enabling capability for spacecraft serving a variety of purposes to enable different applications, including the following.</p><p>• Change of orbit altitude, orbit corrections: The primary purpose of propulsive capabilities on spacecraft is to alter the orbit by changing orbital elements such as altitude or inclination. This can include changes in orbital altitude and corrections to maintain an orbit by counteracting perturbations. Low earth orbit raising maneuvers can range from 50 m/s to 1.5 km/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. • Life extension by drag compensation: Miniaturized satellites are often deployed in orbit altitudes that guarantee natural decay within a certain timespan to comply with orbital debris guidelines, or to leverage relatively cheap launch opportunities, such as resupply missions to the International Space Station.</p><p>During the active phase of the mission, propulsion can be used to extend the lifetime of the spacecraft, while relying on natural orbit decay caused by the rarefied atmosphere at the end of mission. While Δv requirements for drag makeup depend strongly on orbit altitude and satellite cross section and mass, typical values are in the tens to hundreds of meters per second. • Deorbiting: Propulsive maneuvers can be used to decrease the obit altitude in low earth orbits, after the end of a mission to facilitate induced or natural orbit decay. Depending on the initial orbit, typical controlled reentry Δv values range from 120 to 150 m/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. • Formation flight: Much of the attractiveness of miniaturized space systems comes from the potential to facilitate the deployment of constellations, for a variety of purposes. Constellations bring benefits, such as an increase of revisit times, and the introduction of redundant or distributed architectures. Spacecraft in accurately controlled formation can also enable advanced instruments, as in the LISA mission for gravitational wave detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and distributed apertures to increase resolution such as the proposed terrestrial planet finder <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In most cases, such applications necessitate to maintain the relative spacecraft separation, requiring the capability for propulsive orbit correction, with required Δv ranging from 1 m/s to hundreds of meters per second, depending on orbital mission parameters. • Constellation deployment: Ridesharing and cheap development of larger numbers of miniaturized satellites make constellations of such systems very attractive. Constellation deployment from a shared launch allows to minimize launch cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, obviating dedicated launches in different orbits. Even small Δv delivered by the satellite after delivery from a shared launch vehicle can allow to evenly spread orbits and, therefore, revisit from a shared launch. Depending on mission architecture and time to deploy the constellation, the required Δv can range from 1 to hundreds of meters per second. • Interplanetary missions: Propulsion may be used for primary orbit transfer and control and adjustment as well as attitude control, and as means to desaturate reaction wheels in the absence of a planetary magnetic field. For primary orbit transfer, required Δv depends heavily on the initial launch orbit. For autonomous propulsion to an interplanetary body from a GEO orbit, the necessary Δv to reach earth escape velocity is ~1.3 km/s, whereas attitude control is in the order of 1-10 m/s per year.</p><p>Small satellites could be orders of magnitude less costly than their larger counterparts, with development times in the one to two year range, which are very short compared to traditional project cycles, in some instances reaching a decade or more. This represents a dramatic change in the way satellites can be used, from utility platforms providing traditional services to systems spurring innovation that eventually will lead to vigorous scientific and economic development. Before that happens, however, the challenge of high capable and compact propulsion systems needs to be surmounted. For example, having access to high Δv propulsion in small satellites would allow them to perform rapid, frequent, and affordable exploration of a myriad of objects of interest that are relatively close to Earth. This exploration would increase our understanding of our planetary neighborhood, while also could bring new areas of industrial development. Besides exploration, other areas will benefit from the inclusion of propulsion in small satellites, from imaging and communications, to astronomy and fundamental physics.</p><p>The different nature of these applications results in significantly differing requirements imposed onto the propulsion systems, with a general tradeoff between thrust and specific impulse as detailed in Section II.</p></div>

PROPU LSION PR INCIPL ES</head><p>The ideal change in velocity of a spacecraft Δv is described by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> as a function of the spacecraft mass before m i and after m f a propulsive maneuver</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Δv = I sp g 0 ln ( m i ___ m f )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where I sp = u e / g 0 is the specific impulse, which is defined as the ratio of the propellant exhaust velocity relative to the propulsion system u e and the standard acceleration due to gravity at Earth's sea level g 0 ~ 9.81 m/s 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Chemical Propulsion</head><p>In chemical propulsion systems, thrust is generated by acceleration of a compressed working fluid by expansion to a low density exhaust stream with increased kinetic energy, typically using a converging-diverging nozzle geometry. Increasing the pressure and temperature of the working medium before expansion increases the resulting kinetic energy of the exhaust, and therefore the achieved specific impulse. Available systems are typically classified according to the principle of energy release in the working medium before acceleration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Cold and Warm Gas Propulsion:</head><p>In these basic systems, a high pressure working gas is expanded through a converging-diverging nozzle to create thrust. This principle is limited by the storage pressure achievable in the tank system, typically limited by structural considerations, and often requires a separate pressure regulator to avoid thrust and specific impulse decay as the storage pressure decays over the mission duration as indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. Typical propellants used are isobutane (C 4 H 10 ), the refrigerants R236fa and R134a, and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In warm gas propulsion systems, the working fluid is additionally heated before expansion [Fig. <ref type="bibr">1(b)</ref>], increasing the internal energy of the working medium using an external source, resulting in an increase in specific impulse of the system when compared to cold gas systems; see Section II-C1. Hybrid systems make use of phase changes, or storing a propellant, CO 2 or nitrous oxide (N 2 O), in supercritical condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Although such systems require active components separating the thruster from the high pressure propellant storage, the general simplicity of the system has allowed a high degree of miniaturization, especially with the emergence of microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based valve and other components. With generally low specific impulse of such systems, the total achievable Δv is typically limited for miniaturized satellite systems in which space to accommodate large propellant tanks is not available. However, the ability to achieve small impulse bits and a large number of impulse cycles make these systems attractive for small and precise positioning and attitude control maneuvers.</p><p>Using a multiple staged valve architecture, typically with an intermittent smaller volume reservoir, between main valve and thruster selector valve, allows to decrease the risk of valve failure leading to failures that can prove critical to the satellite mission.</p><p>Typical specific impulse range from ~10 to ~80 s, and thrust levels ~100 μN to ~100 mN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Monopropellant and Advanced Monopropellant Thruster:</head><p>In monopropellant thrusters [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c)</ref>], a high energetic propellant is typically decomposed catalytically or thermally into a high temperature working gas, before it is expanded through a nozzle to a low temperature and density exhaust stream with elevated exhaust velocity. This concept requires storable, and decomposable propellants, and commonly used fluids include hydrazine (N 2 H 4 ) and derivatives, highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and N 2 O. In these designs, propellant selection is typically governing the design and nature of the decomposition chamber, with N 2 H 4 requiring preheating of the catalyst bed. Decomposition temperatures of monopropellants are, in general, low enough to allow for radiation cooling without the need for exotic materials for the chamber designs. Design tradeoffs are usually made between the toxicity and storability of the propellant, which can have a major impact on mission cost. N 2 H 4 , which is highly toxic, reactive, and has high vapor pressure features provides high performance, reliability, and long catalyst lifetime compared to available propellants. However, to comply with reducing mission cost typically strived for in small satellite missions, lower toxicity options such as hydrogen-peroxide-based propulsion systems have been recently developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. As the density of the stored propellant determines the necessary tank volume, the density of the propellant in stored condition can be important in miniaturized designs, leading to increase volumetric specific impulse of high density propellants such as H 2 O 2 when compared to liquids with lower density, such as N 2 H 4 . Another concern specifically for small satellites can arise from the fact that high energetic, and potentially unstable propellant can negatively impact launch opportunities for secondary payloads due to safety concerns.</p><p>Typical specific impulses range from ~100 to ~230 s and thrust levels range from ~100 mN up to hundreds of newtons.</p><p>Originally motivated by the search for less toxic propellant alternatives to hydrazine-based derivatives, monopropellant systems based on ammonium dinitramide (ADN) or hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) have been developed with considerable effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In such systems, the propellant is typically thermally and catalytically decomposed, with significantly higher performance than traditional monopropellants. Such systems are, therefore, similar to monopropellant systems in terms of necessary fluidic components, comprising a single propellant tank and feed stream, but they provide energy release and, therefore, performance similar to traditional bipropellant systems. An ADN-based propulsion system has already been successfully tested in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, and the Green propellant infusion mission (GPIM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> is currently awaiting launch to increase the maturity of a HAN-based propulsion system by in-orbit validation.</p><p>Typical specific impulses for such systems are between ~200 and ~250 s, and thrust levels range from hundreds of millinewtons to tens of newtons.</p><p>3) Bipropellant Propulsion: In bipropellant systems as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref>, combustion of an oxidizer and a fuel are utilized to create a high-temperature, high-pressure gaseous mixture that can be expanded using a convergingdiverging nozzle to create a high velocity exhaust stream. Such systems typically show highest performance in terms of specific impulse, but also come with most complexity due to typically two independent fluidic feed systems including two separate tanks and valve sets. Typically used, storable, noncryogenic propellant combinations are monomethylhydrazine (MMH) or unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) with oxidizers such as dinitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4 ), MON-1 or MON-3, or less toxic combinations such as H 2 O 2 kerosine, or H 2 O 2 methane <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Bipropellant systems feature the highest performance for chemical systems per stored propellant, but require generally complex propellant managements system with multiple active components. Due to the higher flame temperature compared to monopropellant thrusters, radiative cooling of the combustion chamber requires high temperature metals, often refractory metals such as rhodium or platinum alloys, and can lead to radiative energy transfer from the hightemperature combustion chamber to the satellite structure which needs to be considered in design. Bipropellant systems are, therefore, typically used in missions with higher Δv requirements such as apogee orbit insertions or maneuvers involving significant orbit changes.</p><p>Typical specific impulses are ~300 s with thrust levels usually starting from 10 N.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Solid and Hybrid Propulsion</head><p>By combusting a solid propellant, solid propulsion systems provide a hot working gas that is then expanded to produce thrust [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(e)</ref>]. Solid propulsion systems can be designed without complexity of moving actuators, but generally lack restarting capability and precise controllability, and have been considered as end-of-life deorbiting devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. Restarting capability and increasing performance are investigated by introducing hybrid configurations where part of the reactants is fed into the solid combustion chamber using a fluidic system as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(f). While increasing the utility of such propellant systems, this typically comes with added system complexity and is, therefore, currently considered of limited use for miniaturized space systems.</p><p>Typical specific impulses for miniaturized solid motors range from ~150 to ~280 s, with thrust levels ranging from tens to hundreds of newtons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Electric Propulsion</head><p>EP systems differ from chemical propulsion devices by the means of energy supply for exhaust acceleration. While in chemical propulsion systems the energy is generally stored within the molecular bonds of the propellants and is released by combustion, decomposition, or expansion, EP systems use an external energy source, supplying electrical power that is used to accelerate the exhaust. While any source supplying electrical power such as nuclear reactors or radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTD) can be used, in most cases, especially in small satellites, electrical power is supplied by solar panels.</p><p>1) Electrothermal Acceleration: Historically, resistojets were the first instance in which an external energy source was used to electrothermally augment traditional chemical rockets and was originally applied to N 2 H 4 . In such devices, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a), the propellant gas is typically heated by an electrically heated surface in various configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> to increase the propellant gas beyond the stagnation temperature of the purely chemical propulsion system, and therefore augment the resulting exhaust velocity after expansion. Resistojets have been employed over a wide range of power levels and propellants, with gas-heater heat transfer usually being the premier design challenge. While traditional Proceedings of the IEEE 5 resistojet designs have not been found in small satellites so far, warm gas thrusters in which the entire propellant, or a small subset of the propellant is heated in a separate reservoir before injection into the acceleration chamber, can be seen as a somehow related thruster type that has been developed with special focus on small satellite applications.</p><p>Arcjets [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b)</ref>] on the other hand augment the propellant gas temperature by creating a steady arc discharge, typically through the nozzle throat from a cathode inside the combustion chamber that is annually surrounded by propellant gas flow. Heating the gas by means of a discharge allows to surpass the maximum working temperature of conventional heating elements, that typically limit the performance of resistojets. While providing higher performance than traditional monopropellant and resistojet propulsion systems, the added complexity of arcjets necessitating a fluidic and a power-intensive electrical subsystem have prevented usage of such propulsion systems in small satellite applications to this point.</p><p>2) Electrostatic Acceleration: Electrostatic space propulsion devices accelerate charged particles, mostly ions, by electrical forces when falling through a potential drop across two electrodes and are the most evolved EP concepts originating back to the 1950s.</p><p>Ion engines, also know as Kaufman ion engines or electrostatic thrusters, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(e), accelerate ions that are produced in an ionization chamber using a potential drop between an extractor and an acceleration grid. Ion production can be accomplished by collision with injected electrons and radio-frequency (RF), microwave, or contact ionizations. The expelled ion beam is then typically neutralized by an external electron emitter. The first gridded ion thruster has been tested on a suborbital flight on the SERT I spacecraft in 1964 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Ionization efficiency in such devices is a function of propellant and electron current as well as residence time of the injected gaseous propellant in the ionization chamber, limiting the miniaturization in terms of volume. Miniaturization of a durable cathode for electron supply presents a challenge with respect to miniaturization, in addition to the ability to manufacture flat grids out of materials that show high resistivity to ion erosion while space charge between the accelerating grids limits the achievable emission current density and therefore thrust. Recent developments in miniaturized ion engines make use of RF ioniziation, obviating the need for an internal electron emitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. Ion engines have been employed in notable missions such as Deep Space-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Dawn <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, and GOCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, and typically achieve specific impulse between I sp = 2000-3000 s.</p><p>Hall thrusters present a second form of highly developed electrostatic accelerator systems that was flown among others on the SMART-1 moon transfer mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and has become attractive due to the absence of any acceleration grids which are typically life limiting components due to erosion and electrical breakdowns. Hall thrusters, on the other hand, feature an annular ionization and acceleration chamber in which a neutral gas is injected near an upstream anode through a manifold, and is subsequently ionized by electrons that are injected downstream, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(f</ref>). These electrons are attracted to a positive upstream anode, while strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the gas flow force the electrons on a precessing path along the annular chamber, increasing the residence time and, therefore, probability of collision with the injected neutral gas. The ions, due to their higher molecular mass, feel a proportionally weaker acceleration by the magnetic force, and are primarily accelerated electrostatically by the potential drop between the anode and a cathode situated at the exit of the otherwise insulating annular chamber. While specific impulses achieve by Hall thrusters are generally lower than in ion engines around I sp ~ 1500 s, they feature higher thrust densities (up to an order of magnitude higher than in ion engines) and can be adapted over a wide range of power levels.</p><p>Colloid-electrospray thrusters and field emission electrostatic propulsion (FEEP) [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(d)</ref>] are propulsion systems with similar acceleration principles, but differ in terms of production of charged particles. In FEEP thrusters, a liquefied metal propellant, such as indium, gallium, or cesium, is suspended over a sharp emitter structure to increase the localized electric field at the apex. Balancing the electrostatic pull and the surface tension, the conductive liquid metal deforms into a Taylor cone <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, which further increases the local field strength at the apex, where the ionization threshold can be surpassed, leading to the ejection of ions. These ions are then accelerated by the same electric field used for extraction. In electrospray thrusters, ionic liquids or electrolytes are used as propellants, with the latter tending to produce significant ratios of slow moving droplets, whereas ionic liquid electrosprays are able to operate in pure ionic mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. While electric conductivities, and therefore ultimately emission current per emission site, of such propellants are generally lower when compared to liquid metals ion sources, they do not require energy to liquefy the propellant by heating and, therefore, have the potential for higher system efficiency, assuming similar beam properties. In addition, no ionization is required due to the nature of the ionic liquid propellant since molecular ions are readily extracted from the propellant bulk <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. In addition, ionic liquid electrospray thrusters are capable of producing charged particles of both polarities, obviating the need for an external neutralization device as required in other EP systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. Due to the absence (in case of electrosprays) or locally confined (FEEP) ionization process, both FEEP and electrospray systems feature uniquely small ionization/ acceleration chambers and lend themselves favorably toward miniaturization.</p><p>3) Electromagentic Acceleration: While in electrostatic propulsion systems, the force that is acting on the accelerated charged particle is reciprocally felt by the accelerating electrode, the definition of electrostatic pressure T / A = 1 / 2 ϵ 0 E 2 with T / A the thrust density, ϵ 0 the vacuum permittivity, and E the accelerating electrical field strength, imposes a limit to the achievable thrust per area in real devices where E cannot typically be increased indefinitely. In electromagnetic devices however, the force transfer from the accelerated particle beam to the structure occurs via magnetic fields in such devices, allowing for higher thrust densities.</p><p>Magnetic plasma dynamic (MPD) thrusters are high power propulsion systems with self-induced magnetic fields and operate at power levels incompatible with small satellite technology, but would be interesting for larger spacecraft due to their ability to reach multi newton thrust levels.</p><p>Pulsed plasma thrusters (PPTs) and vacuum arc thrusters (VATs), on the other hand, are a type of propulsion system that is operated in an unsteady regime, in which a solid propellant, typically Teflon, is ablated by an induced discharge, and acceleration of ablated material occurs by the Lorentz force. As the magnetic fields in the acceleration electrodes interact with the magnetic field induced in the perpendicular discharge, the ablated material is accelerated perpendicular to the discharge surface as indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(c</ref>). The pulsed operation, in which a capacitor is slowly charged and then rapidly discharged, suits itself well to small power budgets, and operation frequency can easily be adjusted to available power.

Propellantless Propulsion</head><p>In addition to traditional propulsion system that operate by accelerating neutral or charged particles to produce thrust, a variety of propulsion concepts utilizing different physical mechanisms have been proposed and tested.</p><p>1) Solar Sail Propulsion: It uses low density solar radiation pressure to generate thrust, by typically employing lightweight, expandable structures to obtain very high surface-to-mass ratio, contracting the low forces due to low radiation pressure. This concept has been notably tested by the Venus bound IKAROS spacecraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref> and the CubeSat LightSail-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. In addition to radiative pressure propulsion, these expandable structures have been used as end-oflife deorbit devices to lower a low earth orbiting spacecraft by significantly increasing the atmospheric drag, as proven in the NanoSail-D mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Electrodynamic tethers are long, conductive wires or structures deployed in orbit in the presence of a planetary magnetic field and ionosphere, producing a force by the interaction of the external magnetic field and the charges moving along the tether which, for propulsion purposes, is held at a different potential with respect to the spacecraft using a power supply, thus adding kinetic energy to the orbit. To remove kinetic energy, for example, to lower the orbit altitude, the ends of the tether can be electrically shortened. Motion of the spacecraft with respect to the magnetic field will induce a voltage difference, drawing a current across the tether, which interacts with the external magnetic field, effectively reducing the orbital velocity. An extreme form of high specific impulse propulsion is photonic propulsion, which utilizes the photonic pressure to produce thrust. While thrust levels are generally too low for power levels achievable in small satellites with respect to traditional solar system bound missions, this concept has attracted interest either by using external high power laser beams to propel nanosatellites <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>, or in the context of small propulsion maneuvers in very long mission durations, such as attitude corrections in interplanetary femtosatellites <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>.</p><p>Further concepts of propellantless propulsion include magnetic sail propulsion, in which a loop structure induces a magnetic field that interacts with solar wind, leading to an exchange of momentum to the magnetic sail structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, and electric sail propulsion, in which a large conductive mesh is kept at a positive potential relative to a solar wind plasma, blocking positive particles, therefore leading to a theoretical exchange of momentum toward the spacecraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. Due to the small order of magnitude of such interactions which necessitates large-scale structures, such concepts have not yet evolved beyond conceptual studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PER FOR M A NCE MET R ICS OF SM A LL SATELLITE PROPU LSION T ECHNOLOGY</head><p>A plethora of propulsion systems suited for small satellites and beyond has been developed and researched in the recent years, with multiple different propulsion principles matured through inspace testing or ready for commercialization, from both chemical propulsion systems and EP systems. While chemical propulsion systems used as primary propulsion means on small satellites showed some overlap with existing technologies used for station keeping on larger space platforms, miniaturization of propulsion devices to smaller platforms such as nanosatellites and beyond required significant effort to achieve miniaturization without significant decrease in performance, and led to a variety of new developments altogether.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows a classification of the different propulsion systems for small satellites discussed in Section II, supplemented with data from commercially existing systems in terms of thrust and specific impulse. For space qualified systems, the satellite name is included in brackets. While this plot is intended to provide a general classification of the different propulsion solutions, care should be taken with the individual performance metrics of the propulsion systems, as these rely on data provided by suppliers, and are determined with a varying degree of accuracy and detail. In this plot, the data shown for each propulsion system correspond to the nominal operational point provided by the suppliers. It should, however, be noted that especially EP systems are capable of throttling over significant ranges, as discussed later. Propellantless systems are not included in this plot as a specific impulse becomes a meaningless metrics, and bipropellant engines are omitted due to their limited utility for miniaturized satellites. A notable exception is the 30 HYDROS propulsion system <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>, which is based on the combustion of H 2 and O 2 provided by electrolysis of stored water, and does not require two separate propellant streams as do traditional bipropellant systems.</p><p>While there is significant overlap for electrical propulsion systems based on different acceleration principles, several trends can be clearly identified.</p><p>• Cold and warm gas propulsion systems occupy the lower specific impulse range, but are available over a large range of thrust. As expected, cold gas propulsion systems are found on the lower bound in terms of specific impulse, while heated systems are capable of increasing the specific impulse to ~ &lt; 100 s.</p><p>The ability to generate large numbers of small impulse bits makes these systems attractive for small orbit and attitude correction applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Chemical propulsion systems based on decomposition</head><p>of an energetic compound, such as HAN-, ADN-, or hydrazine-based systems are found on the high thrust region of the plot, with specific impulse significantly higher than cold and warm gas systems, but lower than the bulk of EP systems. • EP systems feature increased specific impulse, and range from thrust levels comparable to cold gas systems to micronewtons levels. Inside this group, the highest performing systems in terms of specific impulse are FEEP thrusters, which generally show a wide range of throttleability. A variety of commercially available ion engines are available, with thrust levels comparable or higher than electrospray thrusters, with lower specific impulse than FEEP thrusters. • Pulsed plasma thrusters are found on the lower thrust and lower specific impulse region of the studied EP systems. • One miniature Hall thruster was considered, to be on a mature level compared to the other systems investigated. Hall thrusters are capable of providing the highest thrust of all EP systems considered, but feature lower specific impulse compared to the available ion engines. In order to compare propulsion systems, it is important to consider, besides propellant mass, the physical parameters of the propellant during storage, most notably the propellant density. It is, therefore, useful to introduce the concept of volumetric specific impulse, defined as I sp vol = ρ prop I sp given in [kg s/m 3 ], with ρ prop the propellant density at storage conditions, allowing to draw conclusions of the specific impulse achievable per required storage volume. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> gives a comparison of the volumetric specific impulses for commercial chemical propulsion systems as a function of nominal thrust. If no information on storage pressure was available, storage under liquid conditions was assumed, unless information indicating otherwise. For the TNO T3μ PS it is noted that due to the gas generation principle from a solid material, the volumetric specific impulse has only limited significance, and therefore a generic propellant density was calculated based on gas generator volume and propellant mass stored, conservatively attributing 12.5% of the volume to the propellant (assuming the same density for propellant and gas generator). It should be noted that volumetric specific impulse can be an important metric for EP systems as well, however in most cases, the auxiliary system mass such as the mass of the power processing unit can significantly alter the total system mass, and therefore inhibits a systems comparison solely on volumetric specific impulse. As the PPU masses vary considerably for the EP systems considered, a comparison of EP systems based on volumetric specific impulse is not considered here. Nevertheless, the importance of propellant storage density as a fundamental parameter is highlighted for EP systems as well.</p><p>The first important conclusion evident from the data shown Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> is the importance of considering the thermodynamic state in which the propellant is stored under storage conditions, evident from the significantly lower volumetric specific impulse for the only system considered that features propellant stored in gaseous state, compared to the systems that guarantee liquid propellant storage conditions. Except for the gaseous argon-based system, most cold gas systems feature very similar propellant densities, therefore being more similar than when compared on specific impulse level, except for the systems using S F 6 , which has densities comparable to HAN-and ADN-based chemical propellants. The only higher performing chemical systems with lower density compared to other systems are the N 2 H 4 -based MPS-120 and the water-based HYDROS thruster.</p><p>The discussion so far has neglected to mention the power consumption of EP systems, which, with increased miniaturization of the spacecraft itself, can act as a main factor limiting usability. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> plots the nominal thrust as a function of the system input power for a variety of EP systems. For pulsed thrusters, the nominal impulse bit is plotted. The systems operational at lowest power levels are pulsed plasma thrusters and electrospray thruster systems, with the latter achieving higher thrust for the same power consumption compared to pulsed plasma thrusters, which corresponds well to the generally lower total efficiencies found for pulsed plasma thrusters. It should be noted that due to the adjustability of the duty cycle, pulsed systems such as PPTs or VATs  Proceedings of the IEEE 9 can be operated at even smaller average power consumptions, albeit at the cost of further decreasing the achieved impulse bit. Electrospray thrusters generally exhibit throttleability without significant impact on performance, and it is noted that they can be operated well below the indicated power and thrust levels. FEEPs using liquid metals show excellent throttleability in terms of thrust, but typically cannot be steadily operated below a certain power threshold required for heating the propellant. Ion engines, on the other hand, occupy the higher power spectrum, showing comparable or higher thrust levels than FEEPs or colloid thrusters, but cannot typically be operated below 10 W. Miniature Hall thrusters are found at the high power spectrum of this comparison, with the potential for increased thrust levels.</p><p>The investigated EP systems are available over a wide range of power levels, and it is, therefore, useful to look at the relationship of specific impulse and the thrust-topower ratio. As the relationship between system power, thrust, and specific impulse is typically not trivial for the individual systems, a comparison of the stated performance at the nominal operational point is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. In this comparison of specific thrust per power to specific impulse, it is again evident that ion engines and FEEPs, providing highest specific impulse, trade in the middle in terms of thrust per input power, whereas electrospray, colloid, and Hall thrusters feature the highest thrust-to-power ratio.</p><p>Comparison of Figs. 5 and 6 also shows that while thrusters with predominantly electrothermal acceleration, such as the Phase Four RFT thruster, can achieve similar thrustto-power ratios, they feature significantly reduced specific impulse compared to other EP systems.</p><p>Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, and 6 compare the specific impulse of different propulsion systems at the nominal operational point. However, it should be noted that especially EP systems are often capable to operate over significant throttling ranges. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the throttling capability of selected EP systems, plotting the thrust and specific impulse as a function of input system power.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V I. SC A LING L AWS FOR SM A LL SAT ELLIT E PROPU LSION T ECHNOLOGY A. Gas Dynamic Acceleration</head><p>Direct scaling of existing propulsion systems to smaller envelopes in terms of volume and power is generally limited by a nonlinear increase in the inefficiency beyond a certain point, as inefficiencies do not scale linearly with devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>. Perhaps the biggest challenge in maintaining high efficiency while miniaturizing gas dynamic systems is the scaling of the Reynolds number, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref> Re ∝ p 0 D t / T 0 1.2…1.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where D t is the throat diameter and subscript 0 refers to stagnation conditions. In general, for a nozzle to scale without viscous losses, the Reynolds number would need to remain constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref>. For this to be possible, the stagnation pressure of a system would need to increase proportionally to the decrease in thrust, which is hardly ever possible in actual devices for engineering reasons. Experimental data for Reynolds numbers of micromachined nozzles with throat diameters in the order of hundreds of micrometers, ranging from 10 2 to 10 4 , have been reported, with the extreme case of Re&lt;1000 for nozzles ~20 μm , where a significant portion of the flow is found in the subsonic boundary region, leading to significant viscous losses and, therefore, significant decrease in nozzle efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref>.</p><p>Another example of a physical loss mechanism not decreasing linearly with decreased thruster size are thermal losses in chemical propulsion systems. Considering exemplarily the widely accepted correlation from Bartz for the convective heat transfer coefficient at the throat of a nozzle <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">q ̇ = h g ( T g -T w ) , h g ∝ D t 1.6 ____ D 1.8 ( P c ___ c * ) 0.8<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where P c is the chamber pressure, c * is the characteristic velocity, and D is the diameter at which the equation is evaluated. This relation assumes constant Reynolds number scaling, which from the discussion above, is evidently an optimistic assumption. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) it is evident that the losses due to convective heat transfer scale according to D t 1.6 , whereas the thrust, which is linear to the mass flow, scales according to T ∝ D t 2 . This indicates the nonlinear increase of thermal losses, and therefore reduced efficiency, with increased miniaturization of propulsion systems that convert thermal energy into kinetic energy of the exhaust by expansion. In addition, this relationship indicates increased heat load on the throat region of such systems with increased miniaturization, which can become crucial for higher performing thrusters: As active cooling, as accomplished in larger chemical propulsion devices, is not expedient for miniature systems due to a number of reasons, including size constraints, complexity, and cost, (5) can dictate the choice of an inefficient operational regime to lower the total heat load by decreasing the hot gas temperature T g , for example, by operating in a nonstoichiometric combustion regime in bipropellant engines. The miniaturization of reaction chambers in propulsion systems utilizing decomposition or combustion of compounds, such as monopropellant and bipropellant thrusters, is additionally limited by the residency time τ that the reactants take to complete the intended reaction, which can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">τ = L __ v = LρA ____ m ̇ (6)</formula><p>where v is the mean propellant velocity, L and A are the chamber length and cross section, respectively, ρ is the mixture density, and m ̇ is the mass flow. This relationship establishes a minimum chamber volume necessary for a given propellant mass flow m ̇ , and thus thrust, which is required in order to avoid inefficiencies due to incomplete reaction. While this provides a minimum volume to avoid losses from incomplete reaction, the increased thermal losses described in (5) will become increasingly decisive for miniature devices. This trend is amplified by the typical temperature dependency of chemical reactions, which amplifies the negative impact of thermal losses by decreasing the rate of reaction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Gas Phase Ionization:</head><p>With the exception of electrospray and FEEP thrusters, most EP systems rely on ionization of a neutral gas, by either electron collision, RF ionization, or contact ionization. In these gas phase ionization systems, namely ion engines and Hall thrusters, the propellant utilization efficiency is therefore primarily governed by the ability to ionize the propellant within the acceleration chamber. In electron collision ionization, the probability for a collision to take place is dependent on the mean-free path λ λ = 1 ____ n e Q <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where Q is the collision cross section and n e is the number density of electrons in the plasma. As the mean-free path relates to the probability of a neutral particle to experience a collision and ionization, miniaturization of the Proceedings of the IEEE 13 ionization chamber needs to scale with the mean-free path to retain thruster efficiency. This typically means operating in a higher density regime, which can have a detrimental impact by causing higher losses, such as higher ion fluxes to the chamber walls. In Hall thrusters, permanent magnetic fields are used to force the externally injected electrons on a precessing orbit along the cylindrical discharge chamber to increase residence time and therefore probability of collision with the injected neutral propellant. The radius of precession r e is given by r e = m e v e ____ eB <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where m e , v e , and e are the electron mass, velocity, and charge, respectively, and B is the magnetic field strength.</p><p>As the chamber dimensions need to be matched to the electron precessing radius, increased miniaturization in such devices without efficiency deficiency can only be achieved by increasing the magnetic field strength B , which is either a material parameter of the permanent magnets used, or determines the scaling of power for electromagnets, which increases with increasing miniaturization, reducing the overall efficiency.</p><p>Note that, in addition, miniaturization of ionization chambers, especially in light of increasing the plasma density, comes with increasing particle flux toward the chamber walls, leading to increased erosion rates, which has a negative effect on lifetime.</p><p>2) Electromagnetic Pulsed Thrusters: In PPTs and VATs ionization is accomplished in a small envelope along a usually solid propellant surface, whereas the energy transfer into the plasma discharge, and therefore the final kinetic energy of the exhaust, is proportional to the change in the circuit impedance and, therefore, proportional to the area the discharge circuit is encompassing during acceleration. Ziemer and Choueiri <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref> showed a quasi linear decrease in thruster efficiency with decreasing pulse energy, showing the increasing significance of plasma resistance for decreasing pulse energy.</p><p>3) Liquid Phase and Field Emission Ionization: Ion evaporation from a liquid phase or field emission ionization are processes occurring when a conductive liquid is electrically stressed above a threshold where particle extraction is achieved. While the field strength required for such processes is generally high, the electrostatic stressing forces the conductive liquid into a sharp structure, such as a Taylor cone (FEEP), <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> or similar electrified meniscii <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref>, which amplifies the local field strength at the tip of the structure, allowing for a region of high enough field strength for ionization or ion evaporation. While dependent on the geometry and liquid properties, the force balance at the apex can be expressed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1 __ 2 ϵ 0 E 2 ~2 γ __ r * (9)</formula><p>where ϵ 0 is the vacuum permittivity, E is the local field strength, γ is the liquid surface tension, and r * is the radius of curvature of the emitting region that is formed by the mass flow balance of depleted and replenishing ion flow. The beam composition of FEEP is found to be largely dominated by singly charged ions, in the presence of slower microdroplets, reducing the average beam velocity and, therefore, specific impulse <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref>. While similar in terms of the engineering implementation, electrospray emitters operate by extracting charged particles from an ionic liquid propellant, capable of operating in the pure ionic mode, in which only ions and ions solvated to the n th degree are emitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. In current versions of thrusters with larger total emission currents achieved by multiplexing the number of emission sites, operation is typically in an ion-dropled mixed regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, in which droplets with lower charge-to-mass ratio are accelerated to lower exhaust speed, lowering the specific impulse but increasing the thrust produced.</p><p>Charged particle extraction processes require local field strengths in the order of 10 9 V/m for ion emission. In the case of an ionic liquid emission site, (9) allows to estimate the size of the region of ion extraction of r * ~ 15 nm (for an ionic liquid with 1 Si/m conductivity, γ ~ 0.05 N/m). While the characteristic dimension of the Taylor cone itself could be orders of magnitudes larger than the region of actual charge emission described by r * , it should be noted that, theoretically, thrust densities in the order of MN/m 2 would be possible, for experimentally found emission currents of hundreds of nanoamperes per emission site, which translates to ~0.05-0.1 nN. However, due to the high local field strength required to surpass the threshold for ion evaporation, and the need to amplify the applied electric potential using field enhancing structures to support the Taylor cone, current technology does not allow for such dense packing of emission sites in engineering implementations. The current MIT electrospray thrusters feature 480 emitter structures per square centimeter, while test emitters with up to four times the emitter density have been successfully fabricated to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Systems Consideration</head><p>Increasing miniaturization of the thruster heads without compromise in efficiency is considered advantageous regardless of acceleration principle, as it not only decreases the structural mass and volume of the system, but may also allow redundant systems. However, any miniaturization only achieves its full potential if its merit is not outweighed by the mass and volume required by auxiliary propulsion components in the propulsion system. While advances have been made in the miniaturization of auxiliary components such as the Busek Microvalve used for the colloid thruster system on LISA Pathfinder <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref>, the propellant stored itself constitutes a natural barrier toward miniaturization. Any meaningful miniaturization of a thruster technology therefore needs to consider the entire propulsion mass, highlighting the importance of maintaining, or increasing, the propulsion system efficiency with advancing miniaturization. This becomes most important for technologies used in space missions with high Δv requirements, as in such cases, the stored propellant mass easily outweighs the mass of the thruster and auxiliary components and it may be more productive to increase the specific impulse of the thruster, than striving to decrease the structural mass of the thruster and components without considering the impact on the overall propulsion system. Based on the discussion in Sections III-VI, two promising approaches are highlighted.</p><p>1) Technologies that miniaturize without impact on efficiency: Liquid phase ionization technologies such as the ionic liquid electrospray emitters do not suffer from an inherent decrease of performance with advancing miniaturization of engineering devices beyond submillimeter scale. Such systems scale, therefore, linearly in terms of thrust, and are, in theory, not subject to an adverse impact on the specific impulse. Such systems thus allow miniaturization of the thrusters, without increasing the amount of stored propellant to accomplish a given mission requirement, therefore leading to an overall decrease in the mass and volume of the propulsion module.</p><p>2) Technologies with novel aspects that have positive systems impact: Novel technologies can outweigh inefficiencies that originate from miniaturization of a thruster by having a net-positive impact when considering the overall propulsion system. The HYDROS system developed by Tethers Unlimited <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> is a bipropellant system which uses electrolysis of stored water to produce the reactants. Such a system could provide specific impulse similar to a bipropellant engine in the future, but may come with significantly lower structural mass for the propellant storage system compared to a traditional bipropellant system. Even for a modest decrease in efficiency of the thruster, caused by the small size of the bipropellant combustion chamber and considering the added electric power required, the overall system can favorably trade off in terms of the overall system mass and volume required.</p><p>An independent systems aspect that can become significant with increased miniaturization is potential electromagnetic interference (EMI), especially in the case of miniaturized EP systems. Such interference can become an issue for thrusters which require components with strong, unsteady magnetic fields, such as RF thrusters or thrusters with unsteady operation principle, such as PPTs, which require a high current discharge. While shielding measures can, to some extent, decrease such unwanted interactions, miniaturization necessarily requires closer spacing and smaller margins on components, and care needs to be taken to avoid undesired interaction of high voltage components with sensitive subsystems such as onboard computers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Chipsats and Membrane Spacecraft:</head><p>Pushing the boundaries of miniaturization of spacecraft, Kicksat <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> was an early instance of radical miniaturization of semiautonomous systems, with a 3U CubeSat designed to deploy 128 subsatellites called Sprites, intended to perform basic functionality including communication with the dispensing satellite. While limited in capability, and ultimately not successful due to a malfunction in the dispensing mechanism, this and followup missions in which individual chipsats were launched as independent piggyback payloads to other satellites, highlighted the theoretical capability of extremely miniaturized spacecraft, especially in large swarm constellation concepts. A related concept, called Wafersat, was undertaken by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the MIT Space System Laboratory, in which a satellite platform with full capabilities similar to a larger sized CubeSat will be reduced to a mass-producable silicon wafer form factor. While such missions pose challenges to a variety of subsystems, including thermal and communications, specific challenges are imposed on future propulsion systems that are deemed an enabling technology for such missions, both for orbit and attitude controls. Using the baseline of Wafersat, requirements for propulsion systems regarding mass, volume, power, and total impulse can be derived for a propulsion system usable for minor orbit correction and attitude control. Based on a standard 8-in wafer form factor, the total impulse required for a year of drag compensation ranges from ~22.5 to ~3.35 kNs in a 400-km altitude orbit, depending on the angle of attack. For an angle of attack of zero, which is with minimal drag cross section, a state-ofthe-art electrospray emitter with specific impulse of 1500 s could perform a year of drag compensation in such an orbit using &lt; 0.2 g of propellant. Another example are ultrathin spaceraft such as the membrane-based Brane Craft, studied by the Aerospace Corporation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In this concept, the spacecraft itself consists of a flexible, thin membrane with large surface-to-volume ratio, imposing strict volume requirements on the propulsion system that is required to fit within the 30μ m envelope. Janson <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> concluded that electrospray emission from sharp emitter structures in combination with a separate extractor and acceleration grid could be accomplished within the scale of 10 μ m, fed passively with propellant that could be distributed around the emitters in a gap between the spacecraft membrane layers, leading to significant propellant mass per emitter, with 40 h of accumulated firing time identified as a baseline. In addition, Janson's analysis showed that acceleration of up to 0.1 m/s 2 could be achievable, which is orders of magnitude higher than typical EP systems, partly enabled by the favorable large surface area, enabling large solar panel area and, therefore, a high power per spacecraft mass configuration.</p><p>As outlined in Section VI, the only currently available system that theoretically allows controlled propellant acceleration at sufficient efficiency within submillimeter scale Proceedings of the IEEE 15 is a liquid phase ionization system, and both the MIT Wafersat as well as the Brane Craft studies use electrospray emitters as their current baseline technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>2) Infinite Specific Impulse Propulsion: Infinite specific impulse propulsion, that is propulsion without the need for propellant stored onboard the spacecraft, is attractive for long duration, very high Δv missions, potentially enabling interplanetary, asteroid encounter (including the planned NASA NEA Scout CubeSat mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[92]</ref>) and deep space exploration missions, such as the scientifically rewarding targets in the region of the outer planets and Oort cloud, positioning a spacecraft in the gravitational focus point of the sun to form a future powerful telescope <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[93]</ref> or even interstellar flight attempts as proposed by the project Starshot <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[94]</ref>, which attempts to propel a miniaturized spacecraft to Proxima centauri using a man made high power light source. Besides mission studies of such long-term goals, technology demonstration missions of solar radiation pressure-based sail technology have been launched so far, including Jaxa's IKAROS sail <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[95]</ref> and the LightSail-1 CubeSat mission by the Planetary Society <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. In addition, similar technology has been tested on NASA's Nanosail-D2 CubeSat, but for the purpose of increasing the spacecraft atmospheric drag area for deorbiting purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[95]</ref>. The 14-m 2 solar sail was deployed in June 2010 onboard the 300-kg IKAROS satellite and was able to accumulate a change in orbital velocity of approximately 100 m/s until December 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[96]</ref>. Despite a variety of technical issues on Lightsail-1, it was able to successfully deploy the 32-m 2 solar sail, (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref>), acting as a precursor for the followup Lightsail-2 mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V II. CONCLUSION</head><p>The success of small satellites has led to increased mission and scientific capabilities of miniaturized spacecraft, spurred by the decreased mission cost and faster development schedules. As mission complexities evolve, the need for high capability propulsion, previously mostly reserved for traditional large satellite platforms with high power budgets, has driven the development of a plethora of propulsion solutions for small satellites, CubeSats, and beyond. This review discusses the different propulsion principles applicable to small satellites, and presents a classification of available propulsion solutions, including a variety of different chemical and EP systems of varying complexity and performance. A classification of these propulsion systems is given, based on the tradeoffs in performance parameters, including thrust, specific impulse, and input power. A review of selected space qualified propulsion systems is presented, highlighting key technologies for specific satellite classes. A discussion of the predominant scaling laws for miniaturization of different propulsion systems is given, identifying the limiting factors in miniaturization on thruster, and system level is given. Based on this, the propulsion related requirements and state-of-the-art technologies for the extreme cases of chip and membrane satellites, and infinite specific impulse missions are discussed. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
