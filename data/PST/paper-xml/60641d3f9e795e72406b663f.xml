<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstractive summarization is useful in providing a summary or a digest of news or other web texts and enhancing users reading experience, especially when they are reading on small displays such as mobile phones. However, existing encoder-decoder summarization models have difficulty learning the latent alignment between source documents and summaries because of their vast disparity in length. In this paper, we propose a extractor-abstractor framework in which the keyword-based extractor selects a few sets of salient sentences from the input document and then the abstractor paraphrases these sets of sentences in parallel, which are more aligned to the summary, to generate the final summary. The new extractor and abstractor are pretrained from a set of "pseudo summaries" extracted by specially designed heuristics, and then further trained together in a reinforcement learning framework. The results show that the proposed model generates high-quality summaries with faster training speed and less training memory footprint, and outperforms the state-of-the-art models on CNN/Daily Mail, Webis-TLDR-17, Webis-Snippet-20, WikiHow and DUC-2002 datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Abstractive summarization is the task of creating a short, accurate, and informative summary from a long text document without using the exact sentences from the source. This is useful in generating a snippet or digest for a searched web page or other web text. The essence of summarization is to compress information from the input document and retain only most important information in the output. This process can be seen as aligning the salient information from the source to the output. Recently, encoder-decoder (enc-dec) models with attention mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26]</ref> have made great progress on abstractive summarization. The attention mechanism is a way of capturing the alignment between input sequences of the encoder and decoder, trying to tell which parts of the source document are relevant to which parts in the summary. However, since lots of non-essential parts in the source document are omitted in the summary, the alignment using only attention mechanism is unsatisfactory. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows that two state-of-the-art enc-dec models, i.e., PointGen <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref> and BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>, both frequently make incorrect alignments by either missing some salient parts or including redundancies.</p><p>Source document new delhi, india police have arrested four employees. federal education minister smriti irani was visiting a fabindia outlet in the tourist resort state of goa on friday when she discovered a surveillance camera pointed at the store 's changing room. four employees of the store have been arrested, but its manager was still at large saturday . state authorities found an overhead camera that the minister had spotted and determined that it was indeed able to take photos of customers. authorities sealed off the store and summoned six top officials from fabindia. the arrested staff have been charged with voyeurism and breach of privacy. if convicted, they could spend up to three years in jail .

The bold words or phrases are salient information. The underlined parts are redundant information in the output. Some salient information is also missing from the output.</p><p>An alternate view <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5]</ref> of the summarization process is to paraphrase the salient parts in the source document, i.e., summary sentences are aligned to the salient parts of source document (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). This gives rise to a two-stage, extractor-abstractor (ext-abs) framework, which first selects salient sentences from the source (extractor) and then paraphrases the selected ones to generate a summary (abstractor). The ext-abs framework has two advantages: i) the input and output of the abstractor can be better aligned; ii) reduced size of the input to the abstractor reduces both training and inference time.</p><p>To train an ext-abs framework, one has first to generate the intermediate results, i.e., the salient sentences in the input document for all training samples. Since the real salient sentences are not known in practice, we call the intermediate result obtained algorithmically the pseudo summary. Pseudo summaries are used for training both the extractor and the abstractor in the ext-abs framework. As the intermediate result, the low-quality pseudo summaries can bring noises to the model. Better pseudo summaries can reduce the noise and enhance the alignment between encoder and decoder of abstractor. Previously, there are two types of heuristics to create pseudo summaries: sentence-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref> and summary-level methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27]</ref>.</p><p>Sentence-level methods assume that there is one unique salient sentence in the source that matches each sentence in the reference summary. To this end, they extract the sentence with the highest ROUGE score <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref> for each reference sentence. This simple assumption gives rise to the design of parallel abstractors (one for each reference sentence) to achieve speed-up. However, the very nature of summarization dictates that a sentence in the summary may be condensed from multiple sentences in the source and not just one. For example, in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, the first sentence in sentence-level pseudo summary is pertinent to both 1 ùë†ùë° and 2 ùëõùëë reference sentences in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, while the second pseudo sentence misses out some information ("changing room") of 2 ùëõùëë reference sentence. In response to this deficiency, summary-level methods were proposed to select the best combination of a subset of input sentences that maximizes ROUGE score with reference summary as a whole. Nevertheless, they lose the advantage of parallelism in the sentence-level approach. Worse still, when mixing all the sentences together, they treat every token equally in computing the ROUGE, resulting in pseudo summaries that are similar to the reference only by unimportant words. For example, The summary-level pseudo summary in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> doesn't match the information about "authorities" and "arrested", which are more important in the story.</p><p>In this paper, we present a novel set-level matching heuristics that divides the reference summary into a few disjoint clusters of sentences, each of which represents a topic or an aspect, and matches a non-overlapping set of sentences in the source with each cluster of reference sentences. This new heuristics strives to trade off the pros and cons of the previous two approaches. Instead of assuming one-to-one or all-to-all alignment between the pseudo summary and the reference summary, we are assuming a many-to-many alignment, which allows for more flexible alignment while still achieving parallelism using multiple abstractors. When computing the similarity between the pseudo summary and the reference, on top of ordinary ROUGE scores, we emphasize keywords in the reference summary. This amounts to representing summaries not only as a sequence of words but also as a set of important keywords. Accordingly, we Sentence-level 1) federal education minister smriti irani was visiting a fabindia outlet in the tourist resort state of goa on friday when she discovered a surveillance camera pointed at the store's changing room.</p><p>2) state authorities found an overhead camera that the minister had spot -ted and determined that it was indeed able to take photos of customers.</p><p>3) if convicted, they could spend up to three years in jail.

Previous ext-abs models use sentence-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref> or summary-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1]</ref> ROUGE scores as the reward. The sentence-level rewards can not properly reflect the quality of overall summary because of overlapping contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22]</ref>, while summary-level rewards ignore the accuracy of the sentences extracted at each step. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive reward which is the weighted sum of sentence/set/summary-level ROUGE scores. This comprehensive reward can help the extractor select sentences that match abstractive reference summaries better.</p><p>In summary, our contributions are as follows:</p><p>(1) Our set-level matching heuristics extracts better pseudo summaries as the training data to pretrain both the extractor and the abstractor, and subsequently allows the abstractor to learn the alignments effectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">APPROACH</head><p>Our new ext-abs framework is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. There are three main components: a keyword-based extractor, an abstractor and a comprehensively rewarded reinforcement learning (RL). As a preprocessing step, we first obtain the set-level pseudo summary from the training data. We then pretrain the keyword-based extractor using the source document and the pseudo summary, and the parallel abstractor using the pseudo summary and the reference summary. Finally, we use RL to bridge the pretrained extractor and abstractor to further finetune the parameters in both models. The RL updates the extractor and abstractor by a comprehensive reward evaluating both the extracted intermediate summaries and abstractive summaries at sentence-level, set-level and summary-level.</p><p>In the rest of this paper, we use the following definitions.</p><p>‚Ä¢ A source document ùê∑ is a sequence of sentences (ùëë 0 , ..., ùëë ùëñ , ...);</p><p>‚Ä¢ A set-level pseudo summary ùëÉ is a sequence of sentences organized in sets denoted as (ùëù 0 0 , ùëù Next, we describe the preprocessing of the training data to obtain pseudo summaries, and the key components in the framework. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data Pre-processing: Set-level Matching Heuristics</head><p>In order to enhance the alignment between pseudo summaries and generated summaries, we propose a set-level matching heuristics to obtain pseudo summaries based on a set of keywords. We use TextRank algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref> to extract the keywords from the reference summary and obtain the set-level pseudo summary by Algorithm 1. For instance, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> we extract the sentence sets covering the most reference keywords (bold) with the highest ROUGE-2 scores from the source document for each reference sentence. Then, if there is an overlap between two extracted sentence sets, the two sets will be merged into one and their reference sentences will also be merged into a longer sentence. In the end, each sentence set in pseudo summary has a corresponding sentence set in reference summary. As a result, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> the 1st reference sentence matches source sentence 1), and the best matching for the 2nd reference sentence is the combination of source sentence 1) and 2). The pseudo summary set consisting of source sentence 1) and 2) is corresponding to the combination of 1st and 2nd reference sentences.</p></div>

Keywords encoder learns keywords representations and guides the decoder to select more accurate sentences. The model is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. Keywords Encoder. We use TextRank algorithm to receive a sequential list of keywords from the source document, ordered by their original positions in the source. We take convolutional neural network (CNN) model to embed extracted keywords as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(k 1 , k 2 , ..., k |k | ),</formula><p>where |ùêæ | is the number of keywords. The combination of keywords representation and sentence representation enbodies the intuition that the keywords are more important carriers of the salient information and should be treated specially during sentence selection. Document Encoder. We consider two options for the document encoder: training from scratch with BiLSTM document encoder and fine-tuning on pretrained model named HIBERT document encoder. The former is a standard document encoding model, and the latter is the state-of-the-art pretrained model for document encoding.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(‚Ñé 0 , ‚Ñé 1 , ..., ‚Ñé ùëõ ) where ‚Ñé ùëñ = [ ‚àí ‚Üí ‚Ñé ùëñ ; ‚Üê ‚àí ‚Ñé ùëñ ] is the representation of ùëñ-th sentence.</formula><p>The HIBERT document encoder is a pretrained encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>, which contains two Transformer-based sub-encoders. We combine the word embeddings and their corresponding position embeddings as the input and obtain the context sensitive sentence representations (‚Ñé ‚Ä≤ 0 , ‚Ñé ‚Ä≤ 1 , ..., ‚Ñé ‚Ä≤ ùëõ ) as the output. Aligned Pointer Decoder. We extend Pointer Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref> as the decoder. The pseudo summary consisting of multi-sentence sets is the input of the decoder. We extract a set of keywords for each multi-sentence set in the pseudo summaries and order them based on their positions in the input text. To distinguish the sentences and keywords in different sets, we set the representations for the placeholder &lt;SEP&gt; in pseudo summaries and pseudo keywords. The pseudo summary becomes ùëÉ = (ùëù 0 0 , ùëù 0 1 , ..., ùëù 0 ùëó , ùëÜùê∏ùëÉ, ùëù 1 ùëó+1 , ..., ùëÉ ùëö ùë• ), and its keywords become ùêæ = (ùëò 0 0 , ùëò 0 1 , ...ùëò 0 ùëó , ùëÜùê∏ùëÉ, ùëò 1 ùëó+1 , ..., ùëò ùëö |ùëò | ). We randomly initialize the representation of ‚Ñé ùëÜùê∏ùëÉ for pseudo summary and ùëò ùëÜùê∏ùëÉ for pseudo keywords.</p><p>At each time step ùë°, we take the output of decoder attending to the encoder sentence representations as the predicted vector ùëê ‚Ñé ùë° , which is calculated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ùëê ‚Ñé ùë° = ùëõ ùëñ ùõº ‚Ñé ùëñùë° ùëä ùëé1 ‚Ñé ùëñ ùõº ‚Ñé ùë° = softmax(ùë£ ‚Ñé tanh(ùëä ùëî1 ùëî ùë° + ùëä ‚Ñé1 ‚Ñé ùëñ ))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ùëî ùë° is the decoder hidden state at step ùë°. ‚Ñé ùëñ is the sentence representation of ùëñ-th sentence based on document encoder (BiLSTM or HIBERT). ùëé ‚Ñé ùë° is the attention weights based on sentences. ùëä and ùë£ in different labels are trainable parameters. Similarly, the keywords vector ùëê ùëò ùë° can be computed. We compute the current extraction probabilities using predicted sentence vector and keywords vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ùëù (ùë¶ ùë° |ùë¶ 1 , .., ùë¶ ùë° ‚àí1 , ùëê ‚Ñé , ùëê ùëò ) = softmax(ùë£ tanh(ùëä ùëî ùëî ùë° +ùëä ‚Ñé ùëê ‚Ñé ùë° +ùëä ùëò ùëê ùëò ùë° ))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where ùë¶ ùë° is the sentence with the highest probability at current step.</p><p>Combinatorial Loss. We propose a combinatorial loss to train extractor, including cross-entropy loss, keywords loss and set loss. The cross-entropy loss reflects the accuracy of one-to-one alignment between extracted sentences and pseudo summaries, which is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ùêø ùëêùëí = ‚àí (ùëÉ,ùê∑ ) ‚ààùëá log(ùëù (ùëÉ |ùê∑))<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">ùë§ !

We align the &lt;SEP&gt; of ùëÉ and ùëÑ in the same position by padding or truncation the sequence of sentence labels in the set of ùëÉ.

The loss of ùëñ-th set in pseudo summary is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ùêø ùë†ùëù (ùëñ) = (1 + ùëÉùëúùêø (ùëñ)) 2 ùêø ‚Ä≤ ùëêùëí (ùëñ) ùëÉùëúùêø (ùëñ) = ùêø ‚Ä≤ ùëêùëí (ùëñ) ùëö ùëñ=0 ùêø ‚Ä≤ ùëêùëí (ùëñ)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where ùëÉùëúùêø(ùëñ) is propotion of the loss of ùëñ-th sentence set over the complete summary.

Then, the abstractor paraphrases the sets in ùëÑ, and connects the rewritten sentences with &lt;SEP&gt; to generate an abstractive summary ùê¥. At each time step ùë°, in order to compare the intermediate summary ùëÑ and pseudo summary ùëÉ, we define a sentence-level reward using ROUGE-L (R-L) score between the sets of ùëÑ and ùëÉ at the same position.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ùëÖ ùë†ùëíùëõ (ùë° ) = ùëÖ-ùêø ùêπ 1 (ùëû ùë° , ùëù ùë° )<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The sentence-level reward directly measures the accuracy of intermediate summary sentences.

We compute the set-level reward by ROUGE-2 (R-2) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ùëÖ ùë†ùëíùë° (ùë° ) = ùëÖ-2 ùëüùëíùëêùëéùëôùëô (ùëé ùëô , rùëô ), if ùë° = ùëè + |ùëû ùëô | ùëÖ-2 ùëüùëíùëêùëéùëôùëô (concat(ùëû ùëô ùëè ...ùëû ùëô ùë° ), rùëô ), otherwise<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where ùëêùëúùëõùëêùëéùë° concatenates all the inputs. rùëô is the ùëô-th set of sentences in R and |ùëû ùëô | is the number of sentences in ùëô-th set of ùëÑ. ùëè is the index of the first sentence of ùëô-th set in ùëÑ. ùë° = ùëè + |ùëû ùëô | means that the prediction of ùëô-th set in intermediate summary is over. For set-level reward, at step ùë°, we concatenate all of the extracted sentences in ùëô-th set as a extracted set ùê∏ ùëô ùë° and compute the R-2 score between ùê∏ ùëô ùë° and its corresponding set rùëô in reorganized reference summary. At the end of the prediction of this set, we compare the abstractive summary ùëé ùëô generated from ùëû ùëô with rùëô . Since reference summary is abstractive which has many variant, the R-2 matching bigram between summaries is more suitable. As the ùê∏ ùëô ùë° is the part of the input of the abstractor, the ROUGE score reflects the alignment between the input and output of abstractor during test. The higher recall between ùê∏ ùëô ùë° and rùëô means that the ùê∏ ùëô ùë° contains more information of rùëô and can predict better abstractive summary.</p><p>Considering the quality of an overall generated summary, we compute summary-level reward as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ùëÖ ùë†ùë¢ùëö (ùë° ) = Ô£± Ô£¥ Ô£¥ Ô£≤ Ô£¥ Ô£¥ Ô£≥ ùëÖ-2 ùêπ 1 (concat(ùëé 0 ...ùëé ùëô ), concat(r 0 ...r ùëô )), if ùë° = ùëô 0 |ùëû ùëô | ùëÖ-2 ùêπ 1 (concat(ùëû 0 0 ...ùëû ùëô ùë° ), ùëÖ), otherwise<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where ùë° = ùëô 0 |ùëû ùëô | means that prediction of ùëô-th set in intermediate summary is over.

We use F1 score as reward, because the length should be considered during evaluating the whole generated summary, which can also reflects the alignment of abstrator. At the end of the prediction of each set, we compare the concatenated generated abstractive summary and corresponding reference summary.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Results</head><p>for the framework. We compare our proposed models with existing models. Following previous work, we take reference summaries in datasets as the ground truth of extractive summaries and abstractive summaries.</p><p>Extractor. We train the extractor on (source document, pseudo summary) pairs. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref>, the keyword-based extractor achieves higher ROUGE scores on various datasets. The basic models (PN ùëéùëë and HIBERT ùëéùëë ) with only one document encoder have been improved on ROUGE scores by adding keyword encoder (KE), which demonstrates that KE is useful to guide extractor to select more accurate sentences. After adding combinatorial loss (CL), the ROUGE scores become higher. The reason is that the composition of CL is consistent with the extraction of pseudo summaries and the structure of extractor. Besides, CL containing keywords loss can help extractor to select sentences with more keywords. The ROUGE scores of extracted summaries generated by HIBERT ùëéùëë are higher since the HIBERT ùëéùëë is fine-tuned on a pretrained model which can enhance the language modeling ability. Compared with PN ùëéùëë , the HIBERT ùëéùëë can capture more information about the relationship between inputs of the encoder and the decoder, including keyword information. Therefore, the improvements on different datasets of HI-BERT document encoder (HIBERT ùëéùëë ) are always less than BiLSTM document encoder (PN ùëéùëë ). As shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, compared with the extractor without keyword encoder, the sentences extracted from our keyword-based extractors can capture more keywords of reference summary. However, the extractor without CL always generates duplicate keywords. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">8</ref>     keywords with less repetition. The reason is the loss function of KE ùêª ùêºùëêùëô considers the accuracy of the extracted keywords.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Models CNN/DM Web17 Web20 Wiki DUC R-1 R-2 R-L R-1 R-2 R-L R-1 R-2 R-L R-1 R-2 R-L R-1 R-2 R-L</formula><p>As the extractor is the first step of ext-abs framework, the output of the extractor is very important. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref>, with the same abstractor, the ext-abs frameworks with keyword-based extractor get higher ROUGE scores. This shows that the keyword-based extractor can provide better input to abstractor.</p><p>Abstractor. We improve the abstractor by creating a new training set, pseudo summaries, which enhances the alignment between input of encoder and decoder. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> shows that the models trained on set-level pseudo summaries generate more accurate summaries. The models with our designed special loss (PG ùë†ùëô and BART ùë†ùëô ) get higher ROUGE scores on sentence-level and set-level pseudo summaries, because the special loss considers the global information of the summary during parallel summarization. We do not apply special loss to the abstractor trained on summary-level pseudo summaries since the input of abstractor on summary-level pseudo summaries is complete and it cannot be processed in parallel. The summaries generated by pretrained models achieve higher ROUGE scores due to better document representations. As shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, with the same extractor, the abstractor with special loss can generate more informative summaries with less redundancy.</p><p>Comprehensive Reinforcement Learning. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref>, we combine our extractor and abstractor in different ways. Compared with BART, PG cannot abstract the extracted sentences effectively and achieves worse ROUGE scores than its connected extractors. The ROUGE scores of summaries generated by keyword-based extractor with BART are lower because the less effective extractor brings more noise to the downstream abstractor.

We observe the changes of different models after adding RL. As shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>, after adding sentence-level or summary-level reward, the ROUGE scores of the models on datasets become worse, which demonstrates that it is important to desige a suitable reward for ext-abs framework. The models trained on CRL achieve better ROUGE scores than that trained without RL, which denotes that our CRL can enhance extractor to select more accurate sentences. The ROUGE scores of extractor extended by RL are improved. The CRL bridges the backpropagation from abstractive summary to source document. So the ROUGE-based comprehensive rewards between generated summaries and reference summaries reflect the quality of extracted sentences and generated summaries which can guide the extractor to select correct sentences. The higher ROUGE scores of ext-abs with RL also show that the ext-abs model can benefit from a better extractor.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">8</ref>, our strongest model with CRL (KE ùêª ùêºùëêùëô -BART ùë†ùëô -CRL) outperforms the SOTA abstractive models on all datasets. As BART is the SOTA abstractive summarization model, the ROUGE scores of KE ùêª ùêºùëêùëô -BART ùë†ùëô -CRL are better than the BART but they are close. We take t-test to measure the difference Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">8</ref>: ROUGE scores of different end-to-end trainable models on datasets. The scores underlined are statistically significantly better than BART with p &lt; 0.05 according to t-test.</p><p>of ROUGE scores between our model and BART. The p-values on ROUGE scores of the SOTA model BART and Pre-KE ùëêùëô -Abs ùë†ùëô -CRL of all datasets are less than 0.05, except for Web20. As the reference summary in Web20 is very short and abstract, it is difficult to extract pseudo summary aligned to the reference summary. The performance of models on Web20 is close and not good. This shows that the ext-abs framework with our approaches are effective. As test-only dataset, DUC testing on KE ùêª ùêºùëêùëô -BART ùë†ùëô -CRL gets highest ROUGE scores, which shows that our proposed model has a better generalization. The FastAbs ùêª ùêµ in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">8</ref> takes HIBERT as extractor and BART as abstractor. FastAbs ùêª ùêµ gets lower ROUGE scores than BART due to its poor alignment of sentence-level training set and its extractor without keyword-based encoder. The best ROUGE scores of our models show that the abstractive models can be improved by locating the salience information. As shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, the summary generated by our model with CRL contains more keywords and becomes more readable.</p><p>Speed and Memory. We take the speed and memory usage of CNNDM as example. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref>, we evaluate our models on the speed and memory usage. Based on fune-tuning on the pretrained model or not, we compare our KE ùëêùëô -PG ùë†ùëô -CRL with PG and KE ùêª ùêºùëêùëô -BART ùë†ùëô -CRL with BART, to be fair. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref>(a), KE ùëêùëô -PG-CRL is almost 7 times faster in total training time and occupies less memory than PG. We cannot fine-tune BART on GPU RTX-2080ti due to out-of-memory. We test BART based on the released pretrained model. The KE ùêª ùêºùëêùëô -BART ùë†ùëô -CRL performs much better than BART on speed and memory usage. In Abstractive models have to encode long documents with attention model looking at all encoded tokens at each time step, which causes low speed and large memmory usage. As a pointer network, our extractor is faster than most abstractive models. Our models first extract sentence sets from a source and then input them to abstractor. These inputs can be decoded in parallel, which speed up the model. The average length of inputs is shortened from 780 to 100, which reduces the memory usage. The FastAbs and FastAbs ùêª ùêµ are faster than our models because they train and test models on sentencelevel pseudo summaries which are shorter than our set-level pseudo summaries. However, the difference is not significant. This is because that the different matching heuristics may extract different sentences for the same sentence in the reference summaries.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Pretrained Models for Summarization</head><p>The pretrained transformer language models have success in natural language understanding (NLU). and natural language generation (NLG) NLU models are pretrained on unidirectional and bidirectional prediction. GPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref> employs a unidirectional transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref> to predict the sequence. ELMo <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref> learns two unidirectional language models of forward and backward. BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> uses a bidirectional transformer encoder to predict the masked words. NLG models pretrain on sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. UniLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref> is a multi-layer transformer network, including unidirctional, bidirectional and seq2seq language model. BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref> takes combines bidirectional transformer encoder and auto-regressive transformer decoder. ProphetNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref> trains on the transformer seq2seq model and takes future n-gram prediction as self-supervised. Through fine-tuning the pretrained models or representations on summarization task, the quality of generated summaries can be improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>. PEGASUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> is a new, pretrained model for text summarization, which uses self-supervised objective Gap Sentences Generation to train a transformer seq2seq model. Different from previous pretrained models, it masks sentences rather than smaller continuous text spans. We choose BART which has achieve the SOTA results on summarization tasks as a basic component. Since these pretrained model are encoder-decoder models and can be used in the same context, it has the potential to substitute BART in our ext-abs framework and enjoy similar boost in accuracy and speed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>To enhance the alignment between documents and summaries in ext-abs framework, we propose a set-level matching heuristics to extract pseudo summary as training set. We introduce a new ext-abs framework that use comprehensive RL to connect keyword-based extractor and abstractor with pretrained models together. The result shows that our model outperforms the SOTA methods on variant datasets, such as news and web text. Besides, our models are faster and occupy less memory than previous pretrained models during training and testing. In the future, we will improve the extractor and strengthen the relation between extractor and abstractor.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: The process of creating Set-level pseudo summary and reorganized reference summary.
