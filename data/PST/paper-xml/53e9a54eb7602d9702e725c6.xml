<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Pinning stabilization problem of linearly coupled stochastic neural networks (LCSNNs) is studied in this paper. A minimum number of controllers are used to force the LCSNNs to the desired equilibrium point by fully utilizing the structure of the network. In order to pinning control the LCSNNs to a certain desired state, only one controller is required for strongly connected network topology, and controllers, which will be shown to be the minimum number, are needed for LCSNNs with -reducible coupling matrix. The isolate node of the LCSNNs can be stable, periodic, or even chaotic. The coupling Laplacian matrix of the LCSNNs can be symmetric irreducible, asymmetric irreducible, or -reducible, which means that the network topology can be strongly connected, weakly connected, or even unconnected. There is no constraint on the network topology. Some criteria are derived to judge whether the LCSNNs can be controlled in mean square by using designed controllers. The given criteria are expressed in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities, which can be easily checked by resorting to recently developed algorithm. Moreover, numerical examples including small-world and scale-free networks are also given to demonstrate that our theoretical results are valid and efficient for large systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>physically implement and hence have promising applications especially in secure communications based on synchronization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In synthetic biology, it is also a central issue to understand how the cellular behavior emerges from these networks of interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Hence, in this paper, synchronization problem of linearly coupled NNs will be studied. Since time delay is ubiquitous in many biological systems due to the finite signal propagation time and may cause undesirable dynamical behavior such as oscillation and instability, time delay will be introduced into the modeling of NNs. On the other hand, stochastic neural networks (SNNs) have become a new research subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Hence, an array of linearly coupled stochastic delayed NNs, in which stochastic disturbance is characterized by multidimensional Brownian motion, will be considered.</p><p>Synchronization mentioned above is achieved by the local connections of the nodes, and no external force is utilized. In the following, such a synchronous state is named as "final selfsynchronized state." However, the final self-synchronized state, which depends not only on the initial values and intrinsic dynamical behavior of each single node but also on the topology of the coupling network, is very difficult to predict. For many physical, social, and biological dynamical networks, there is a common requirement to regulate the behavior of large ensembles of interacting units by external forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. For instance, many regulatory mechanisms have been uncovered in the context of biological, physiological, and cellular processes, which are fundamental to guarantee the correct functioning of the whole network <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Moreover, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the control method is selected as one of the four key features to understand biology systems at system level. Hence, it is desirable to add some controllers to force the entire LCSNNs to certain given objectives (named as "pinning stabilization").</p><p>Motivated by the above discussion, pinning stabilization of LCSNNs will be considered in this paper. By referring to the pinning idea in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, some local controllers will be pinned to certain selected NNs. It means that only a small fraction of the NNs will be informed about the objective state and the state will be propagated to the rest of the NNs through the local connections.</p><p>Recently, some papers have been engaged in the issue of pinning control of linearly coupled systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Chen et al. laid a fundamental work for pinning control of complex dynamical networks in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, in which a single controller is designed for the pinning control of connected networks. The key point about pinning control of networks is indicated and proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> that all the eigenvalues of the controlled coupling matrix [i.e., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>] are negative. The problem of pinning controllability of complex network is investigated by using the spectral properties of an extended network topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. However, the number of the controllers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is quite large, and stochastic disturbance is not taken into account in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Then, the question is: Can we reduce the number of controllers for the pinning stabilization of LCSNNs? This is exactly one of the objectives of this paper, and these problems are to be addressed by fully utilizing the structure of the network.</p><p>Therefore, we will extend the idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to the case of coupled SNNs. Further, by referring to the structure of coupling networks, the minimum number of controllers will be constructed for the pinning stabilization of LCSNNs. The topology of the coupling network can be arbitrary without any restriction. The remainder of this paper will be organized as follows. In Section II, the model formulation of LCSNNs and some preliminaries will be presented. In Section III, the pinning stabilization problem of LCSNNs with, respectively, symmetric irreducible coupling matrix, asymmetric irreducible coupling matrix, and -reducible coupling matrix will be studied, and some criteria will be derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to guarantee the success of designed controller. In Section IV, several computer numerical simulations will be given to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical analysis, and Section V concludes the investigation.</p><p>Notations: The standard notations will be used in this paper.

For convenience, let . Remark 1: In many literatures, the activation function is typically assumed to be continuous, differentiable, and monotonically increasing, such as the function of sigmoid type. In this paper, these constraints have been removed, and only the Lipschitz condition is imposed in Assumption 1. It should be noted that the type of activation function in (3) has been used in numerous papers.</p><p>As discussed in Section I, in the real world, the NN is often disturbed by environmental noise that affects the dynamical behavior of the system. In this paper, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the stochastic perturbation is introduced into the recurrent NN as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where is an -dimensional Brownian motion defined on a complete probability space with filtration satisfying the usual conditions (i.e., the filtration contains all -null sets and is right continuous). Here, the white noise is independent of for , and is named the noise intensity function matrix. This kind of stochastic disturbance can be regarded as a result of the occurrence of random uncertainties of the NN.</p><p>In this paper, we consider a kind of complex dynamical network by setting each node to be a stochastic neural network (SNN). The th SNN can be expressed by the following delayed stochastic differential equation (SDE):</p><p>(5) where is the state vector of the th NN, and is an -dimensional Brownian motion defined on a complete probability space with nature filtration .</p><p>When stochastic neural networks (SNNs) are linearly coupled via a complex network, we can obtain the linearly coupled stochastic neural networks (LCSNNs) described by the following linearly coupled SDEs: <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where is the state vector of the th delayed SNN, is the inner coupling matrix between two connected NNs for all , is the coupling strength of the LCSNNs, is the Laplacian matrix representing the coupling structure of the LCSNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and the elements in matrix are defined as follows: if there is a connection from NN to NN , then ; otherwise, , and the diffusive coupling condition is satisfied, which implies that the LCSNNs would be decoupled when the array is synchronized.</p><p>In this paper, we want to control the LCSNNs (6) to the desired state , which is an equilibrium point of NN <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. As discussed in many other papers, the stochastic perturbation vanishes at this equilibrium point , that is, . For notational convenience, one can shift the equilibrium point to the origin by using the translation and the equality , which derives the following stochastic dynamical system: <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where , , and</p><p>.

In fact, under conditions ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) has a unique continuous solution on <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In order to synchronize the LCSNN (6) to the equilibrium point , equivalently, one can synchronize the LCSNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> to the origin due to the transformation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MAIN RESULTS</head><p>In this section, three different types of coupling network topologies, the Laplacian matrices of which are respectively symmetric irreducible, asymmetric irreducible, and -reducible (refer to Definition 4 in Section III-C), will be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Symmetric Irreducible Coupling</head><p>In this section, coupling matrix is assumed to be symmetric and irreducible, and pinning stabilization issue of LCSNNs with such coupling matrix in mean square will be investigated. In fact, symmetric irreducible coupling matrix implies that the corresponding coupling network is undirected and strongly connected. For the pinning stabilization of the LCSNNs ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) with symmetric irreducible coupling matrix , the controller is added to the th NN with the concrete form as follows: otherwise <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where is a positive constant. It means that only the first NN is selected to be controlled to stabilize the LCSNNs with symmetric irreducible coupling matrix to the desired equilibrium point in mean square. By using controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, the feedback controlled LCSNNs can be described by the following delayed SDEs: <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where the elements of matrix are defined as follows:</p><p>otherwise. ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)</p><p>Theorem 1: If there exist positive scalars , , , and , and a diagonal positive-definite matrix such that LMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> shown at the bottom of the page, and LMIs ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> hold, where , then the controlled LCSNNs ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) with symmetric irreducible coupling matrix is globally exponentially stabilized by controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> in mean square.</p><p>Proof: According to the structure of the matrix , one has that , and for . Due to the irreducibility of matrix , it follows from Lemma 1 that the determinant of matrix is not equal to zero. By referring to Gershgorin's circle theorem (Lemma 2), we can obtain . Here, we used Lemma 1 and Gershgorin's circle theorem to prove that . It should be noted that the fact that all eigenvalues of the matrix are negative has been proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr">Prop. 1]</ref>. Proposition 1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is a result for the case of real matrices, and its proof is better presentable and easier to understand. Since , it is reasonable to require that LMI (13) holds, that is, . Pre-and postmultiplying ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) by the following block-diagonal matrix: one can obtain LMI ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), shown at the bottom of the page. Since , by using Schur complement <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, one can conclude that ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) holds if and only if with . Then, we can obtain that <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> By <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, there exists a sufficient small positive constant such that (13) (16) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Define a Lyapunov functional as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where and . By using Itô's differential formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the stochastic derivative of along the controlled LCSNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> with symmetric irreducible coupling matrix can be expressed as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> Noticing that and are both diagonal positive-definite matrices, we have the following inequality: <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> where for , and LMI ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) is used.</p><p>By using Lemma 4 and Assumption 1, one can obtain the following inequalities for and :</p><p>(</p><p>It follows from condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> and LMI ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) that <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> By using the inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, - <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, one can obtain from ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) that <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> where is defined as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, and is used.</p><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, we see that . Then, by taking the mathematical expectation of both sides of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, one can obtain that <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> which implies that <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> Therefore, we obtain that <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> which further means that <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> where . Therefore, by Definition 1, it can be concluded that the controlled LCSNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> with symmetric irreducible coupling matrix is globally exponentially stable in mean square, which implies that the LCSNN (9) with symmetric irreducible coupling matrix has been globally exponentially stabilized to the desired point in mean square by using the single controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> acting on the first NN. The proof of this theorem is completed.</p><p>Remark 4: The constraint that matrix is required to be diagonal could lead the result in Theorem 1 to be conservative. For master-slave synchronization of time-delay systems, such requirement can be easily removed to make results less conservative. However, different from master-slave synchronization of two coupled systems, the diagonal constraint of matrix in Theorem 1 comes from the special structure of LCSNNs. If matrix is not assumed to be diagonal, it would be very hard to distill from by referring to inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, in which is used to characterize the controllability of LCSNNs. We will think about this issue in our future research to make results less conservative.</p><p>Remark 5: It should be noted that the size of our results ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) is independent of the network size, because the largest eigenvalue has been distilled to characterize the controllability of LCSNNs. In fact, the size of derived LMI criteria is at most five times of the dimension of each individual system ( in this paper), which is usually quite small comparing with the ability of Matlab LMI Toolbox. Hence, our LMI results are feasible and efficient for large networks coupled with low-dimension NNs. However, for some classes of NNs possessing a large number of neurons (i.e., is very big), the order of LMIs ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-(15) will be very high. In the circumstance, it could be hard for Matlab LMI Toolbox to find feasible solutions to high-order LMIs. From this point of view, we derive an algebraic criterion in Corollary 1, which is more conservative but much easier to be verified for NNs composed of large number of neurons. For the algebraic criterion in Corollary 1, only eigenvalues of large scale matrix are needed to be computed, which implies that such criterion is applicable even for NNs with large number of neurons.</p><p>Corollary 1: The controlled LCSNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> with symmetric irreducible coupling matrix is globally exponentially stabilized by the controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> in mean square if the following inequality holds: <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> Proof: Using Schur complement, this corollary can be proved directly by taking , , and in Theorem 1. Detailed proof is omitted here. Remark 6: We point out that can be regarded as a function of , that is, , and further is decreasing with respect to . (In fact, for two given constants , one can have and . Here, with</p><p>. By Rayleigh quotient, one has that Therefore, it can be concluded that controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> with feedback strength is valid if feedback strength has been verified to be successful. Based on our criteria, the lower bound of feedback strength can be numerically obtained. It should be noted that our obtained lower bound is not the actual one, because our criteria are only sufficient but not sufficient and necessary. Explicit expression of successful feedback strength cannot be obtained since analytical relation between and cannot be derived. Remark 7: Note that the idea behind the controller is that a reference state is introduced only for one NN (the first NN in Theorem 1) which will play a key role for the spread of the reference state. If the LCSNNs is connected tightly enough [i.e., LMIs ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) hold], the reference state will be propagated efficiently and hence the whole LCSNNs will be directed to the desired state successfully. Remark 8: Only one controller is utilized for the stabilization of LCSNNs with symmetric irreducible coupling matrix in Theorem 1. Moreover, at least one controller is needed for such a purpose, since the self-synchronized state of LCSNNs cannot be predicted and one cannot guarantee it to be the objective equilibrium point. Hence, a minimum number of controllers have been used to synchronize the LCSNNs with symmetric irreducible coupling matrix in mean square.</p><p>Remark 9: For some real-world cases, the state variable of NN cannot be observed directly, and hence, the LCSNN is coupled through the output of each NN . This means that the coupling term " " should be replaced by "</p><p>," where is the output of NN . From the mathematical point of view, there is no difficulty in generalizing the result in Theorem 1 to the output symmetric coupling case, if the nonlinear function satisfies certain conditions given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr">Th. 4]</ref>, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. -Reducible Coupling</head><p>In this section, the most general case will be considered. The coupling matrix is assumed to be -reducible. The detailed logistic analysis about why the minimum number is utilized is presented from the systematic point of view. First, the definition of -reducible matrix is given.</p><p>Definition 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>: Consider a reducible matrix of order .  <ref type="figure">,  ,</ref> and<ref type="figure"></ref> , then the corresponding network with such coupling matrix is disconnected with two components. If the irreducible matrix is defined as -reducible matrix, then any Laplacian matrix of its corresponding network (including connected and disconnected) can be represented by an -reducible matrix. Hence, any network can be represented by an -reducible matrix, which implies that the result in this section is quite general.</p><p>By defining irreducible matrices , , and for , LCSNN (7) with -reducible coupling matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> can be decomposed into the following subnetworks denoted by for . It should be noted that the set contains all the row indexes relative to the states of th subnetwork for <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref> It follows from coupled stochastic differential (48) that the subnetwork with is self-contained, and it cannot be influenced by any individual out of the subnetwork . That is to say, the subnetwork is independent from the rest of the subnetworks. By the definition of -reducible matrix, for each , there exists such that . Hence, one can conclude that the subnetwork must be influenced by the subnetwork . As mentioned in Section I, the final self-synchronized state of the subnetworks with is very difficult to predict especially when the individual NNs are chaotic. Hence, we can always assume that the final self-synchronized state of the subnetworks is unknown in this paper. In order to guarantee that the synchronized state of the subnetwork is consistent with the given state ( in this paper), at least one controller is required to synchronize the self-governed subnetwork to the desired state for each in . Therefore, not less than controllers are needed for the pinning stabilization of the self-governed subnetworks , which implies that at least controllers are required to synchronize the LCSNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> with -reducible coupling matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> to the desired state.</p><p>In the following, controllers will be constructed to exponentially stabilize the LCSNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> with -reducible coupling matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> under certain conditions, which means that a minimum number of controllers have been used for the pinning stabilization of LCSNNs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES</head><p>In this section, two numerical examples will be given to verify the theoretical results obtained above. Consider the following two-order SNN as individual node of the LCSNNs to be discussed in the following two examples:</p><p>(57) with parameters where is the state vector of the NN, and . The noise intensity function matrix is taken as By some simple calculations, assumptions (3) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) are satisfied with</p><p>, where is a identity matrix. Without considering the stochastic term in (57), the deterministic NN with the above-given parameters has a chaotic attractor <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(a)</ref>, with initial values , , . The attractor of the SNN (57) is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(b</ref>) with the same initial condition.</p><p>In the numerical simulations, the discretization approach given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> is utilized. The dimension of the Brownian motion is selected to be equal to the dimension of the single NN, that is,</p><p>. Some initial parameters are given as follows: the simulation time with , the normally distributed variance and step size with , and the number of discretized Brownian paths is . The Euler-Maruyama numerical technique is adopted to simulate the stochastic ordinary differential equations. It should be noted that the numerical solution given by Euler-Maruyama numerical scheme will converge to the true solution of the equilibrium point of the system in an expectation sense as the sampling time step size tends to zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Example 1: We consider the LCSNNs with -reducible coupling matrix, in which the inner coupling matrix and coupling strength are, respectively, taken as and . In the following simulation, all initial values are randomly selected from the interval . Consider the following -reducible coupling matrix:</p><p>(58) Stage I-Add Controllers: The controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref> with is used, which means that the nodes 3 and 6 (first node of subnetworks 2 and 3) are to be controlled. One can obtain that </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stage II-Find of Controlled LCSNNs:</head><p>The normalized left eigenvector of corresponding matrices with respect to eigenvalue zero are, respectively, , , and , which implies that , , and . Further, we can obtain that , , and by using Definition 3.</p><p>Stage III-Applying Matlab LMI Toolbox to Find Feasible Solution: Given a single NN as described by (57), by referring to the LMI toolbox of Matlab, one can obtain the feasible solution to LMIs (53)-(55) as follows: and and and Hence, by Theorem 3, it can be concluded that the LCSNNs with -reducible coupling matrix (58) can be stabilized to the original point by controllers <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref> with , which are pinned in the third node and the sixth node. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> plots three independent trajectories of the controlled LCSNNs with independent Brownian motions [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (a)-(c)], and the corresponding average trajectory of the above three simulations is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(d)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the effectiveness of the designed controllers. This example is given to show that our results are applicable and efficient for large networks. It should be noted that the maximum eigenvalue has been distilled to characterize the synchronization controllability of LCSNNs, hence the size of the derived LMIs is not related to the network size anymore. This is exactly the reason why our criteria can be easily verified for large networks.</p><p>Stage I-Framework Description: In this example, two practical network models including BA scale free <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and NW small world <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> will be considered. First, the network is constructed by choosing corresponding parameters and using rules proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The weight of each edge is assumed to be one, then the corresponding Laplacian matrix has been obtained. Second, the node with maximum degree is selected to be controlled with feedback strength . It means that is obtained. Third, the maximum eigenvalue of , which characterizes the synchronization controllability, is calculated. Since networks generated by scale-free and small-world models are not deterministic, repeated simulations are required to verify our result. Hence, the above three steps are repeated 100 times independently. Finally, with the resulting data, four statistical values including mean, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation are calculated as indexes of its concentration degree.</p><p>Stage II-Networks Generation, Add Controller, and the Maximum Eigenvalues Calculation: In the first experiment, scale-free network is considered. The generation of scale-free network is referred to in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Taking , 100 independent scale-free networks are generated with the size being, respectively, 100, 500, and 1000. After adding controllers to the generated networks, the maximum eigenvalues are calculated. Four statistical values are shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. It can be observed that the standard deviation of the data is quite small, which means that the data are quite concentrated in their distribution.</p><p>In the second experiment, small-world network is considered. For the generation of small-world network, refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. In the simulations, the initial degree of nodes and adding probability of edges are, respectively, chosen as and . Then, 100 independent small-world networks are generated with, respectively, 100, 500, and 1000 nodes. After adding controllers to the generated networks, the maximum eigenvalues are calculated. Table <ref type="table">II</ref> displays the statistical values of the 100 independent simulation results. Small standard deviation means a high concentration of our obtained maximum eigenvalues.</p><p>Stage III-Applying Matlab LMI Toolbox to Find Feasible Solution: Among 600 simulated networks, the maximum eigenvalue is in the case of scale-free network with 1000 nodes. The inner coupling matrix and coupling strength are, respectively, taken as and . Given individual node by (57), by using LMI , and . By Theorem 1, LCSNNs with such network structure can be successfully controlled. From LMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, it can be concluded that 600 generated networks can all be controlled, since their maximum eigenvalues are less than . Remark 12: It can be seen from Example 2 that our results are feasible for large scale networks. This is because the maximum eigenvalue calculation of sparse matrix has been well established in Matlab, and then our computation was reduced to small scale LMI problem or algebraic criterion.</p><p>Remark 13: It should be noted that one controller cannot be ensured to be successful for arbitrary size of networks when the dynamical network itself is not sufficiently enough interconnected. Take a scale-free network with 5000 nodes as an example, and the of the parameters are the same as in Example 2. The maximum eigenvalue of controlled dynamical networks is under one controller, and the criteria in Theorem 1 cannot be satisfied to guarantee the success of pinning control. However, if the network itself is further tightly connected by taking , it can be concluded that such scale-free coupled dynamical network can be controlled by one controller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The pinning stabilization problem for LCSNNs has been investigated in this paper. A minimum number of controllers have been designed by fully utilizing the structure of the LCSNNs. For the pinning stabilization of LCSNNs with irreducible coupling matrix, only one controller is needed, and controllers are required for the LCSNNs with -reducible coupling matrix. There is no restriction on the structure of the network. Some criteria have been derived for the pinning stabilization of LCSNNs in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be efficiently solved by using Matlab LMI toolbox. Numerical examples including scale-free and small-world networks have been demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the designed controllers.</p><p>In this paper, all coupled NNs are assumed to be identical. However, in reality, parameter mismatch usually exists between the coupled systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Therefore, it would be of great interest to study synchronization and pinning control of linearly coupled nonidentical NNs. Synchronization bound error <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> could be a useful concept for the investigation of this issue, since complete synchronization cannot be achieved for nonidentical coupled chaotic systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Since LMIs (53)-(</figDesc></figure>
