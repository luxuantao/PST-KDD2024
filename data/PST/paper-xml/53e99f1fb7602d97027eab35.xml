<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Preserving individual privacy when publishing data is a problem that is receiving increasing attention. Thanks to its simplicity the concept of k-anonymity, introduced by Samarati and Sweeney <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, established itself as one fundamental principle for privacy preserving data publishing. According to the k-anonymity principle, each release of data must be such that each individual is indistinguishable from at least k À 1 other individuals.</p><p>In this article we tackle the problem of anonymization of moving objects databases. We propose a novel concept of k-anonymity based on co-localization, that exploits the inherent uncertainty of the moving object's whereabouts. Due to sampling and imprecision of the positioning systems (e.g., GPS), the trajectory of a moving object is no longer a polyline in a three-dimensional space, instead it is a cylindrical volume, where its radius d represents the possible location imprecision: we know that the trajectory of the moving object is within this cylinder, but we do not know exactly where. If another object moves within the same cylinder they are indistinguishable from each other. This leads to the definition of ðk,dÞÀanonymity for moving objects databases. We first characterize the ðk,dÞÀanonymity problem, then we recall NWA (N ever Walk Alone), a method that we introduced in [2] based on clustering and spatial perturbation. Starting from a discussion on the limits of NWA we develop a novel clustering method that, being based on EDR distance [3], has the important feature of being time-tolerant. As a consequence it perturbs trajectories both in space and time. The novel method, named W4M (Wait for Me), is empirically shown to produce higher quality anonymization than NWA, at the price of higher computational requirements. Therefore, in order to make W4M scalable to large datasets, we introduce two variants based on a novel (and computationally cheaper) time-tolerant distance function, and on chunking.</p><p>All the variants of W4M 1 are empirically evaluated in terms of data quality and efficiency, and thoroughly compared to their predecessor NWA. 2 Data quality is assessed both by means of objective measures of information distortion, and by more usability oriented measure, i.e., by comparing the results of (i) spatio-temporal range queries and (ii) frequent pattern mining, executed on the original database and on the ðk,dÞÀanonymized one.</p><p>Experimental results over both real-world and synthetic mobility data confirm that, for a wide range of values of d and k, the relative distortion introduced by our</p><p>Contents lists available at ScienceDirect</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>With today's pervasiveness of mobile phones and other location-aware devices, the amount of traces left by moving objects and daily collected by service providers, is continuously increasing. The wealth of space-time trajectories left by these personal devices and their human companions is expected to enable novel classes of applications, where the discovery of consumable, concise, and applicable knowledge is the key step. These mobile trajectories contain detailed information about personal and vehicular mobile behavior, and therefore offer interesting practical opportunities to find behavioral patterns, to be used for instance in traffic and sustainable mobility management, e.g., to study the accessibility to services.</p><p>Clearly, in these applications privacy is a concern, since location data enable intrusive inferences, which may reveal habits, social customs, religious and sexual preferences of individuals, and can be used for unauthorized advertisement and user profiling. As an example, consider a traffic control application that collects vehicle movements. In a naı ¨ve tentative of preserving anonymity, the car identifiers are not disclosed but instead replaced with pseudonyms. However, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> such operation is insufficient to guarantee anonymity, as location is a property that in some circumstances can lead to the identification of the individual. If one is known to follow almost every morning the same route, it is very likely that the starting point is the home of the individual and the ending point is the working place. Joining this information with some telephone directories we can easily link the trajectory to its owner.</p><p>In this paper we study the problem of preserving privacy when publishing data from moving objects databases. We extend the classical concept of k-anonymity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to deal with this particular form of data, and to exploit its inherent uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In fact the energy in a mobile device is very limited, so it is impossible for a mobile object to continuously send out its location information. To reduce the energy consumption, many methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> are developed for predicting an expected location of a mobile object at a given time t, using some predictive model, e.g., Kalman filter, linear model, etc. If the actual location of the mobile object differs more than an uncertainty threshold d from the predicted location, then the mobile object reports the new location, otherwise it does not. The threshold d is defined by an agreement between the server and the moving object. For sake of presentation, in the following we assume a common d, although our framework can easily handle different d's, as discussed in Section 9.</p><p>The basic idea underlying our proposal is to exploit this inherent position uncertainty in moving objects data, in order to keep low the distortion needed for anonymizing such data before their release.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Problem statement</head><p>Following Trajcevski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> an uncertain trajectory is defined as a cylindrical volume of radius d.</p><p>Definition 1 (Uncertain trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). A trajectory of a moving object is a polyline in three-dimensional space represented as a sequence of spatio-temporal points: ðx 1 ,y 1 ,t 1 Þ,ðx 2 ,y 2 ,t 2 Þ . . . ðx n ,y n ,t n Þðt 1 ot 2 o Á Á Á ot n Þ. During the time segment [t i ,t i + 1 ] the object is assumed to move along a straight line from (x i ,y i ) to (x i + 1 ,y i + 1 ) at a constant speed. Given a trajectory t between times t 1 and t n , and an uncertainty threshold d, the pair /t,dS defines an uncertain trajectory. For each point (x,y,t) along t, its uncertainty area is the horizontal disk (i.e., circle and its interior) with radius d and centered at (x,y,t), where (x,y) is the expected location at time t 2 ½t 1 ,t n . The trajectory volume of /t,dS, denoted Volðt,dÞ is the union of all such disks for all t 2 ½t 1 ,t n . A possible motion curve of t is any continuous function f PMC t : Time-R 2 defined on the interval [t 1 ,t n ] such that for any t 2 ½t 1 ,t n , the spatiotemporal point ðf PMC t ðtÞ,tÞ is inside the uncertainty area at time t: we also adopt the notation f PMC t &amp; Volðt,dÞ.</p><p>Definition 1 is graphically represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Intuitively two trajectories are indistinguishable if they are defined in the same time interval, and they follow almost the same route w.r.t. the uncertainty threshold.</p><p>Definition 2 (Co-localization). Two trajectories t 1 , t 2 defined in [t 1 ,t n ] are said to be co-localized w.r.t. d, iff for each point (x 1 ,y 1 ,t) along t 1 and (x 2 ,y 2 ,t) along t 2 with t 2 ½t 1 ,t n , it holds that Distððx 1 ,y 1 Þ,ðx Note that the definition above requires two trajectories to be defined exactly in the same time interval in order to be co-localized. Although in real-world data it is quite unusual to have two trajectories starting and ending at the exact same time instants, in practice this problem can be tackled by allowing small time gaps, or by selecting coarser time samplings, or more in general, by introducing small information loss. We will discuss later how we deal with this constraint.</p><p>Another way to express the co-localization of trajectories is to say that each one is a possible motion curve of the other. Proposition 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Coloc d ðt 1 ,t 2 Þ ( ) t 1 &amp; Volðt 2 ,dÞ ( ) t 2 &amp; Volðt 1 ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>dÞ</head><p>It is worth noting that co-localization does not induce a partition of a set of trajectories.</p><p>Proposition 2. Coloc d ðt 1 ,t 2 Þ is a reflexive and symmetric relation. For d40, it is not transitive, and thus it does not induce equivalence classes; while for d ¼ 0, Coloc d ðt 1 ,t 2 Þ is also transitive and thus it is an equivalence relation.</p><p>Given an anonymity threshold k, we can define an anonymity set as a set of at least k trajectories that are colocalized. Definition 3 (Anonymity set of trajectories). Given an uncertainty threshold d and an anonymity threshold k, a set S of trajectories is a ðk,dÞÀanonymity set iff jSjZ k and 8t i ,t j 2 S:Coloc d ðt i ,t j Þ.</p><p>The following properties further characterize an anonymity set of trajectories. Proposition 3. A set of trajectories S, with jSj Zk, is a ðk,dÞ-anonymity set iff there exists a trajectory t c such that all the trajectories in S are possible motion curves of t c within an uncertainty radius of d=2: i.e., 8t 2 S:t &amp; Volðt c ,d=2Þ.</p><p>Given a ðk,dÞ-anonymity set S, the trajectory t c is obtained by taking, for each t 2 ½t 1 ,t n , the point(x,y) that is the center of the minimum bounding circle of all the points at time t of all trajectories in S.</p><p>Therefore, an anonymity set of trajectories can be bounded by a cylindrical volume of radius d=2. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we graphically represent this property.</p><p>The problem we study in this article is that of ðk,dÞÀanonymizing a database of trajectories of moving objects.</p><p>Problem 1 ((k,d)-Anonymity). Given a dataset of trajectories D, an uncertainty threshold d and an anonymity threshold k, the problem of ðk,dÞÀanonymity requires to transform D in a dataset D 0 , such that for each trajectory t 2 D 0 there exists a ðk,dÞÀanonymity set S D D 0 , t 2 S; and the distortion between D and D 0 is minimized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Article overview and contribution</head><p>In this article we study the problem of anonymity preserving data publishing in moving objects databases, as formally defined above. In the next section we collocate our contribution within a heterogeneous literature ranging from anonymity and data publishing to moving objects databases and location based services.</p><p>In Section 3 we introduce the basic technique that we use to enforce ðk,dÞÀanonymity, we develop a suitable measure of the information distortion introduced by space translation, and we prove that the problem of achieving ðk,dÞÀanonymity with minimum distortion is NP-hard.</p><p>Therefore, we propose a two-step greedy method: in the first step by means of k-member constrained clustering we group trajectories in clusters having at least k elements; in the second step we perform the minimum space translation needed to push all the trajectories of a cluster within a cylindrical volume of radius d=2 (according to Proposition 3), making them a ðk,dÞÀanonymity set.</p><p>During a preliminary investigation (not reported in this article but available in our technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) we adapted many classical clustering methods to deal with the k-member constraint and to handle trajectories data. Through an experimental comparison we selected greedy clustering as a good trade-off between minimization of information distortion and efficiency. Such simple method is at the basis of all the algorithms that we present in this paper.</p><p>In Section 4 we recall our previous method, namely NWA (N ever Walk Alone) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. NWA is obtained by enhancing the basic greedy clustering algorithm by equipping it with ad hoc pre-processing, and techniques to produce compact clusters at the price of suppressing some outlier trajectories. Starting by a discussion on the limits of NWA, in Section 5 we develop a novel method that, being based on EDR distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (instead of the Euclidean distance as it was NWA), it has the important feature of being timetolerant. The novel method is named W4M (Wait for Me). To the best of our knowledge our algorithm is the first to use EDR as distance function within a trajectory clustering framework, thus providing further assessment of the merits of this distance.</p><p>Another novel idea that we introduce, is to exploit the EDR computation also as a guide on how to perform the last step of the anonymization process. After having clustered trajectories we need to modify each cluster to make it an anonymity set. Being an edit distance, it is EDR itself to suggest us how to do this spatio-temporal editing: this means that we are able to reuse the computation done during the clustering phase also in the points translation phase. The technical details on how to do spatio-temporal editing efficiently are reported in Section 5.2.</p><p>Our experiments in Section 6 confirm that W4M produces higher quality ðk,dÞÀanonymized data than NWA. However, it might be prohibitively expensive for large and complex datasets. Thus, in Section 7 we develop techniques to make W4M scalable. In particular, in Section 7.1 we introduce a novel O(n) spatio-temporal distance function, named LSTD (linear spatio-temporal distance). Being linear, LSTD has the same computational cost of Euclidean distance, but it has not the same limits: in fact LSTD is time-tolerant, can be applied to trajectories of different length, and it is tolerant to outliers. In practice, it represents a good trade-off between Euclidean distance and EDR. In Section 8 all the variants of W4M are empirically evaluated in terms of data quality and efficiency, and compared to their predecessor NWA. Data quality is assessed both by means of objective measures of information distortion, and by more usability oriented measure, i.e., by comparing the results of (i) spatio-temporal range queries and (ii) frequent pattern mining, executed on the original database and on the ðk,dÞÀanonymized one.</p><p>The experiments show that the new techniques make W4M scalable to very large datasets, without giving up quality of the anonymization.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Relational data anonymity</head><p>The traditional k-anonymity framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> focuses on relational tables: the basic assumptions are that the table to be anonymized contains entity-specific information, that each tuple in the table corresponds uniquely to an individual, and that attributes are divided into quasi-identifiers (i.e., a set of attributes whose values in combination can be linked to external information to reidentify the individual to whom the information refers); and sensitive attributes (publicly unknown and that we want to keep secret). In this context, the data holder has the duty of identifying all possible attributes in the private information that can be found in other public databases, i.e., the attributes that could be exploited by a malicious adversary by means of cross linkage (the quasi-identifier). Once the quasi-identifier is known, the ''anonymization'' of the database takes place: the data are transformed in such a way that, for every combination of values of the quasi-identifier in the sanitized data, there are at least k records that share those values. One equivalence class of records sharing the same quasi-identifier values is usually called anonymity set or anonymization group.</p><p>Although it has been shown that the k-anonymity model presents some flaws and limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and that finding an optimal k-anonymization is NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, the k-anonymity model is still practically relevant and in recent years a large research effort has been devoted to develop algorithms for k-anonymity (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). The k-anonymity model has been also shifted from publishing the data to publishing the data mining results, i.e., the patterns extracted from the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Anonymity in location based services</head><p>Existing work about anonymity of spatio-temporal moving objects has been mainly developed in the context of location based services (LBS). In this context a trusted server is usually in charge of handling users' requests and passing them to the service providers, and the general goal is to provide the service on-the-fly without threatening the anonymity of the user that is requiring the service. The concept of location k-anonymity for location based services was first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and later extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to deal with different values of k for different requests. The underlying idea is that a message sent from a user is k-anonymous when it is indistinguishable from the spatial and temporal information of at least k À 1 other messages sent from different users. The proposed solution is based on a spatial subdivision in areas, and on delaying the request as long as the number of users in the specified area does not reach k. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> instead of using the same k for all messages, allows each message to specify an independent anonymity value and the maximum spatial and temporal tolerance resolutions it can tolerate based on its privacy requirements. The proposed algorithm tries to identify the smallest spatial area and time interval for each message, such that there exist at least k À1 other messages from different users, with the same spatial and temporal dimensions. The work described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposes a privacy system that takes into account only the spatial dimension: the area in which location anonymity is evaluated is divided into several regions and position data are delimited by the region. Anonymity is required in two different ways: the first, called ubiquity, requires that a user visits at least k regions; the second, called congestion, requires the number of users in a region to be at least k. High ubiquity guarantees the location anonymity of every user, while high congestion guarantees location anonymity of local users in a specified region. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> the concept of mix zones is introduced. A mix zone is an area where the location based service providers cannot trace users' movements. When a user enters a mix zone, the service provider does not receive the real identity of the user but a pseudonym that changes whenever the user enters a new mix zone. In this way, the identities of users entering a mix zone in the same time period are mixed. A similar classification of areas, named sensitivity map is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>: it classifies locations as either sensitive or insensitive, and describes three algorithms that hide users' positions in sensitive areas.</p><p>Hoh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> study automotive traffic monitoring systems based on probe vehicles equipped with GPS. In particular they study the virtual trip lines, which are spatial markers where the probe vehicles should send their location updates, and how to select these markers in such a way to avoid privacy sensitive locations.</p><p>The approach introduced by Bettini et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is geared on the concept of location based quasi-identifier (LBQID), i.e., a spatio-temporal pattern that can uniquely identify one individual. The goal of introducing the concept of LBQID is that of ensuring that no sensitive data are released from the trusted server receiving the requests, to a service provider, when the data can be personally identified through a LBQID. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> the concept of historical k-anonymity is also introduced. Given the set of requests issued by a certain user (that corresponds to a trajectory of a moving object in our terminology), it satisfies historical k-anonymity if there exist k À 1 personal history of locations (i.e., trajectories in our terminology) belonging to k À 1 different users such that they are location-time consistent (i.e., undistinguishable). What the framework in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> aims at, is to make sure that if a set of requests from a user matches a location based quasi-identifier then it satisfies historical k-anonymity. The idea is that if a service provider can successfully track the requests of a user through all the elements of a LBQID, then there would be at least kÀ 1 other users whose personal history of locations is consistent with these requests, and thus may have issued those requests. This is achieved by generalization in space and time, essentially by increasing the uncertainty about the real user location and time of request. Generalization is performed by an algorithm that tries to preserve historical k-anonymity of the set of requests that have matched the current partial LBQID. If for a particular request, generalization fails (i.e., historical k-anonymity is violated), the system will try to unlink future requests from the previous ones by means of mixed zones technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> that we discussed earlier.</p><p>Although defined in the LBS context this work is very relevant to the problem attacked in this paper, i.e., anonymity in a static database of moving objects. In other terms, a set of trajectories that satisfies historical k-anonymity may be considered safe also in our datapublishing context. The main difference, however, is the fact that they consider data point (requests) continuously arriving, and thus they provide on-line anonymity. More concretely, the anonymization group of an individual is chosen once and for all, at the time this is needed, i.e., when his trajectory matches a LBQID. This means that the k À 1 moving objects passing closer to the point of the request are selected to form the anonymization group regardless of what they will do later, as this information is not yet available. Instead in our context the information about the whole history of trajectories is available, thus we must select anonymization groups considering the trajectories in their whole. This is the main reason why the solution proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> does not seem suitable for our static data-publishing context.</p><p>How to exploit the interesting concepts of location based quasi-identifier and historical k-anonymity in the case of data publishing is a serious, challenging, open problem not addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> nor in other work (see the discussion on quasi-identifiers later in this section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Anonymity of moving objects databases</head><p>All the work described above is developed for location based services. In this paper, instead, we face the problem by the perspective of privacy aware publishing of a static moving objects database.</p><p>Moving objects databases (MOD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is a rather young research area that has received a lot of interest in recent years. Several different MOD problems have been tackled, ranging from indexing <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, representing and querying <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, to updating and modelling imprecision and communication costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>In our setting, we have a static database of moving objects and we want to publish it (for instance for analysis purpose) in such a way that the anonymity of the individuals is preserved, but also the quality of the data is kept high. On the contrary, in the LBS context the aim is to provide the service without learning user's exact position, and the data can also be forgotten once that the service has been provided. In other terms, in our context anonymity is off-line and data-centric, while in the LBS context is a sort of on-line service-centric anonymity. A solution to the first problem is not, in general, a solution to the second (and vice versa), and both problems are important. Consider, for instance, the concept of mix zones previously described: it is a solution for LBS since it still allows to provide the service, but it is not for data publishing, since the quality of the data is completely destroyed.</p><p>While there has been considerable work on anonymity in LBS, to the best of our knowledge only four papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> (all very recent) tackle the problem of kanonymity of moving objects by a data publishing perspective. We will present them in chronological order.</p><p>The first one is our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, whose main contributions are the introduction of concept of ðk,dÞÀanonymity and the NWA algorithm, that are largely discussed in this article. Thus in the following we will focus on the other three proposals.</p><p>The basic assumption of the work by Terrovitis and Mamoulis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is that the adversary owns a part of the trajectories, and more importantly, the data publisher is aware of the adversarial knowledge. The privacy that is required is that any adversary cannot learn anything more than what he already knows from the data publication. The typical scenario is when the data publisher is a credit card company, and the adversaries are the various companies where the customers make some transactions at point-of-sale services using the credit card. The data publisher owns the whole trajectories, while the adversaries own only few points for each trajectory, corresponding to the transactions in their point-of-sale. Anonymization is based on the awareness of the adversarial knowledge, and is obtained only by suppressing the necessary points from each trajectory. While this problem statement fits very well the scenario described above, it is not suitable for other cases, e.g., the scenario of mobility data, where a set of cars equipped with GPS move on a road-network, or users with mobile phones move in a city. In this case we cannot assume that the data owner knows which are the spatio-temporal points known by an adversary.</p><p>Inspired by the condensation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, Nergiz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> tackle the trajectory anonymization problem by means of grouping and reconstruction. In their framework no uncertainty is part of the input of the problem: an anonymity set is defined as a set of size Z k of identical trajectories. To make this feasible it is necessary to generalize points in space and time. Since they consider generalization, trajectory is defined as a sequence of three-dimensional spatio-temporal volumes.</p><p>After providing their generalization-based approach to k-anonymity of trajectories, Nergiz et al. discuss some drawbacks of such an approach, and suggest that in many cases it might be more suitable to publish a reconstructed MOD, instead of a generalized one. In particular, they claim that generalization suffers from two main shortcomings. Firstly, the use of minimum bounding boxes in anonymization discloses uncontrolled information about exact locations of the points: e.g., in the case of two trajectories, two non-adjacent corners give out the exact locations. Secondly, it is challenging to take full advantage of information contained in generalized MODs as most data mining and statistical applications work on atomic trajectories. Therefore Nergiz et al. adapt the reconstruction approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and publish reconstructed data rather than data anonymized by means of generalization. The output after reconstruction is atomic and suitable for trajectory data mining applications. Our proposals do not suffer from the above limits discussed for generalization.</p><p>The main differences between our work and that of Yarovoy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> are that they consider quasi-identifiers and that they use generalization as anonymization techniques. The authors argue that unlike in relational microdata, where every tuple has the same set of quasiidentifier attributes, in mobility data we cannot assume a set of particular locations, or a set of particular timestamps, to be a quasi-identifier for all the individuals. It is very likely that various moving objects have different quasi-identifiers and this should be taken into account in modeling adversarial knowledge. A consequence of allowing different quasi-identifiers for different objects is that the anonymization groups may not be disjoint, or in other terms, they do not form a partition. Thus, there may exist objects that can be identified explicitly by combining different anonymization groups. The authors illustrate by means of attack models the pitfalls of simple adaptations of classical k-anonymity and develop a notion which is proved to be robust against such attacks. Two generalization-based algorithms are proposed and experimentally compared.</p><p>The problem of defining a concept of quasi-identifier for a database of moving objects, that is both realistic and actionable, is not an easy task. On the one hand, it is the nature itself of spatio-temporal information to make the use of quasi-identifiers unlikely, or at least, challenging. The natural spatial and temporal dependence of consecutive points in a trajectory, avoids to identify a precise set of locations, or a particular set of timestamps to be the quasi-identifier. Moreover, as argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, unlike in relational microdata, where every tuple has the same set of quasi-identifier attributes, in mobility data we cannot assume to have the same quasi-identifier for all the individuals. It is very likely that various moving objects have different quasi-identifiers and this should be taken into account in modeling adversarial knowledge. But as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> allowing different quasi-identifiers for different objects creates many challenges: the main one being that the anonymization groups may not be disjoint.</p><p>A different order of challenges regarding the definition of a concept of quasi-identifier for MODs, arises at the practical level. It is not clear from where and how the quasi-identifier for each single user should be defined. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> argue that the quasi-identifiers may be provided directly by the users when they subscribe to the service, or be part of the users personalized settings, or they may be found by means of statistical data analysis or data mining. However, the problem of spatio-temporal quasi-identifier definition in the real-world is an open issue.</p><p>In this paper we tackle the MOD anonymization problem without considering any concept of quasiidentifier: our resulting anonymized MOD contains trajectories each having at least k À 1 other trajectories that, given an uncertainty level d, may be possible motion curves of each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Anonymity by clustering</head><p>Microaggregation is a concept originating from the statistical disclosure control (SDC) research community. In particular, under the name microaggregation goes a family of perturbative SDC methods that have been developed both for continuous and categorical data, and that do not require a hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Whatever the data type, microaggregation can be operationally defined in terms of the following two steps: (i) the set of original records is partitioned into several clusters in such a way that records in the same cluster are similar to each other and so that the number of records in each cluster is at least k; (ii) an aggregation operator is computed for each cluster and is used to replace the original records. In other words, each record in a cluster is replaced by the cluster's prototype. Similar approaches, even if under different names, e.g., k-member clustering for k-anonymity, have been investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and then extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> to deal with attributes that have a hierarchical structure. Usually, after a clustering step what is released is the centroid of each cluster together with the cardinality of the cluster. Another similar approach, condensation, is introduced by Aggarwal and Yu in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> (discussed deeper in Section 3.4).</p><p>Our proposal differs from these results, not only because we work with trajectories of moving objects instead of the usual relations, but also because we introduce uncertainty in the model. While in previous proposals what is released is the centroid of a cluster together with the cardinality of the cluster, in our approach each trajectory is released distinctly while the anonymity is guaranteed by the position uncertainty. This leads to an important benefit of our approach: the fact that the released data has been previously anonymized is much less evident in our approach. It is worth noting that publishing one unique representative per cluster, for a number of times equal to the population of the cluster, can be seen as a special instance (d ¼ 0, i.e., no uncertainty) of our framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Trajectories similarity measures</head><p>While in our first investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> we adopted Euclidean distance as basic distance function to group similar trajectories, in the novel method we present in this work we focus on a more sophisticated and effective distance function, namely EDR (Edit Distance on Real sequences) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The main drawback of Euclidean distance is that it is not able to recognize as similar trajectories with local shifts, i.e., trajectories that follow a similar path but have certain subpaths slightly shifted in time. Moreover, Euclidean distance can only be defined between trajectories having exactly the same length. Although other distance functions recently proposed, such as dynamic time warping <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, longest common subsequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and edit distance with real penalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, can overcome those limitations of Euclidean distance, they are less accurate and robust to noise than EDR.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Techniques for trajectory anonymity</head><p>In the following we discuss various techniques that could be used to enforce trajectory anonymity. We start discussing the basic techniques used in the classical kanonymity setting, generalization and suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, then we discuss the condensation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and finally we introduce the main technique adopted in this paper, namely space translation.</p><p>According to Definition 2, two trajectories to be colocalized must be defined over the same time interval. Informally we call this relation same time span. Although in real-world data it is quite unusual to have two trajectories starting and ending at the exact same time instants, in practice this problem can be tackled by allowing small time gaps, or by selecting coarser time samplings, or more in general, by introducing small information loss that is however necessary to achieve ðk,dÞÀanonymity. This problem is solved in practice by means of ad hoc pre-processing in the NWA algorithm (Section 4.1), and by means of spatio-temporal editing in the W4M algorithm (Section 5.2).</p><p>For the sake of simplicity and presentation, in the rest of this section we discuss techniques for enforcing ðk,dÞÀanonymity always focusing on a maximal subset of trajectories that have the same time span, or, in other terms, elaborating separately each single equivalence class induced by the same time span relation.</p><p>Given a dataset of trajectories D and a time interval T, we denote: D T ¼ ft 2 Djt is defined exactly in Tg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Trajectory suppression</head><p>Suppression can be performed both at the level of whole trajectories, or at the level of single points.</p><p>Given a set of trajectories D T , enforcing ðk,dÞÀanonymity only by means of trajectory suppression is feasible and easy: it requires to remove all trajectories in D T that do not belong to any anonymity set. The main drawbacks of this approach is that it changes significantly the size of the database, and that if used alone this technique usually introduces a too strong information loss. However, when combined with some other techniques, it can be very effective because, by removing few outliers, it can often enhance the overall data quality a lot.</p><p>We embed techniques for outliers detection and suppression in all our methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Point suppression</head><p>Point suppression, i.e., removing one point from a trajectory, can be seen as maximal space generalization: the point is generalized so much that it could be anywhere in the space, so that no information is maintained about the point. Obtaining ðk,dÞÀanonymity by point suppression only is a rather difficult problem. T such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D 0</formula><p>T is the same set of trajectories D T , possibly containing suppressed points, i.e., ðÃ, Ã ,tÞ in place of (x,y,t),</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D 0</formula><p>T is ðk,dÞÀanonymous, and the cost (i.e., number of suppressions) is minimized.</p><p>Theorem 1. The ðk,dÞ-anonymity by point suppression problem is NP-hard.</p><p>Proof. See Appendix.</p><p>As point suppression can be seen as a special case of point generalization, the theorem above holds also for point generalization. All our methods embed some form of point suppression. NWA in its pre-processing phase (Section 4.1) removes some points at the beginning and at the end of each trajectory to form larger equivalence classes w.r.t. the same time span relation. W4M has point suppression as one of the possible edit operations in the spatio-temporal editing based on the EDR distance computation (Section 5.2). Point suppression is also the unique technique used in the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> that we have discussed in Section 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Generalization</head><p>In the classical k-anonymity setting, generalization of attributes that are quasi-identifiers, i.e., replacing real values with less specific but consistent values <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, is the main technique. Given the domain of an attribute there are various ways to generalize its values. For instance, ZIP code ''44705'' can be generalized to ''4470Ã'' (i.e., [44700-44709]), or to ''447ÃÃ'' (i.e., [44700-44799]), or even to ''Ã'' corresponding to maximum domain generalization.</p><p>Generalizing trajectories can be achieved by coarsening space granularity, i.e., by substituting a point (x,y) with an area (e.g., a rectangle), containing (x,y). However, generalization-based anonymization techniques usually rely on predefined generalization hierarchies, whose choice heavily influences the quality and usefulness of anonymized data. In the context of moving objects, many different generalization hierarchies can be chosen, based on the underlying geography: for instance on the road network, or on the city's districts, or city's regions of interest. Which one is the best choice is difficult to know, and a poor choice could result in a poor quality of the anonymized data.</p><p>Moreover, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, generalization-based anonymization techniques can produce high information loss due to unnecessary generalization. This problem is partially solved by the hierarchy-free multidimensional approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, that however has the main limitation of introducing inconsistency in the domain.</p><p>But the main reason for not adopting generalization techniques is that in our context we miss a concept of quasi-identifiers and thus we face the curse of dimensionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> as explained in the following. Under the same sampling time assumption, a dataset D T can be easily seen as a table having one attribute (column) x t and one attribute y t for each t 2 T, and one row for each trajectory t 2 D T . Since we assume every column of D T to be a quasiidentifier, we can easily end up with an extremely large number of quasi-identifiers, thus making very difficult to anonymize the data without an unacceptably high amount of information loss. This is confirmed by an experiment that we conducted using the Mondrian algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> over a real-world small dataset of trajectories (the Trucks dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>). After a pre-processing to create equivalence classes D T of reasonable size, and their flattening in relational tables, we applied Mondrian: in the resulting anonymized dataset, almost all (99.9%) points were maximally generalized, thus yielding complete information loss.</p><p>In conclusion, we do not adopt generalization because according to our problem definition we are constrained to exploit only the uncertainty inherent to the data, without introducing new one. We can see the d parameter as a constraint on the maximum allowed imprecision: thus to fulfill the ðk,dÞÀanonymity requirements we must rely on data perturbation, in the form of space translation. One concrete advantage of our approach over generalizationbased techniques is that the final anonymized dataset has the same spatial granularity for all the trajectories as the original dataset. Thus the fact that the released data has been previously anonymized is much less evident in our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Condensation</head><p>The condensation approach introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is a perturbation-like approach which aims at preserving the inter-attribute correlations of data. It starts by partitioning the original data into clusters of exactly k elements, then it regenerates, for each group, a set of k fake elements that approximately preserve the distribution and covariance of the original group. The record regeneration algorithm tries to preserve the eigenvector and eigenvalues of each group. The general idea is that valid data mining models (in particular, classification models) can be built from the reconstructed data without significant loss of accuracy.</p><p>Condensation has been applied by the same authors also to sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. More recently Nergiz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> applied it to the anonymization of trajectories.</p><p>Being based on clustering and perturbation, this approach is similar to ours. However, our objective is to keep the data as close to the original as possible, exploiting the inherent uncertainty of position data to reduce the amount of distortion needed to anonymize data. Moreover condensation is data mining (classification) oriented and its quality strongly depends on the subsequent data mining analysis performed on the perturbed data: i.e., the same anonymization does not work well for all possible subsequent analyses, and it is not easy to assume that the analysis to be performed is always known in advance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Space translation for ðk,dÞ-anonymity</head><p>Enforcing ðk,dÞÀanonymity by means of space translation involves moving some trajectory points from the original location to another location. The objective is to obtain ðk,dÞÀanonymity while keeping original and translated routes as similar as possible. Since this is the objective, a metric measuring the distortion is needed. As we are assuming trajectories defined over the same time points, the natural choice is the sum of point-wise Euclidean distance between the original and translated trajectories as defined next.</p><p>In the following, given ðx,y,tÞ 2 t, we denote the (x,y) position of t at time t as t½t, the x position of t at time t as t½tðxÞ, and similarly for y. Moreover, Euclidðt½t,t 0 ½tÞ denotes the Euclidean distance between two spatial points. Faced with the hardness of our problem, we propose a two-stage greedy method for providing ðk,dÞÀanonymity: in the first stage we find clusters of trajectories containing at least k members, and in the second stage we apply space translation to move all the trajectories of a cluster within an uncertainty tube of radius d=2, making the cluster become an anonymity set according to Definition 3.</p><p>More in details, in the first step we produce candidate optimal clustering, i.e., clustering such that each cluster has a population size between k and 2kÀ 1. In fact if the cluster size is at least 2k, then it can be further divided into at least two sub-clusters satisfying the k-member constraint, and yielding less distortion as proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>Once we have extracted a candidate optimal clustering, the next issue is how to minimize the cost of space translation needed to transform each cluster into an anonymity set of trajectories. The next lemma provides the minimum distortion space translation for the case</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d ¼ 0.</formula><p>Lemma 1 (Minimum distortion space translation). For any cluster p i of a given candidate optimal clustering P ¼ fp 1 , . . . ,p n g of a dataset D T , and given d ¼ 0, the minimum distortion is obtained when all points are moved to the arithmetic mean of the cluster, denoted t c ½t, for each t 2 T, i.e.: t c ½tðxÞ ¼ P t2p i t½tðxÞ jp i j and t c ½tðyÞ ¼ P t2p i t½tðyÞ jp i j :</p><p>Proof. See Appendix.</p><p>From the lemma above it follows that for any given candidate optimal clustering it is easy to find minimum cost space translation for (k,d)-anonymity, when d ¼ 0. However, when d40 there is no analytical expression minimizing the distortion. In fact, according to Proposition 3, all points must be moved within an uncertainty disk of radius d=2, and points that are already inside such disk have null translation cost regardless of the distance to the disk center. So, even slight changes in the position of the disk, can significatively change the surface of distortion function. Thus, for the cases d40, our strategy for SpaceTranslation is as follows:</p><p>1. first obtain cluster center as for d ¼ 0 (Lemma 1); 2. then move points lying outside the disk onto the disk perimeter, along the direction from the original location to the disk center.</p><p>Example 1. Consider the three trajectories in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">t 1 ¼ /ð1</formula><p>,2,0Þ,ð3,1,2Þ,ð3:5,4,5ÞS, t 2 ¼ /ð4,4,0Þ,ð5:5,1,2Þ, ð5,6,5ÞS, and t 3 ¼ /ð5,3,0Þ,ð6:5,2:5,2Þ,ð9:5,8,5ÞS. Suppose they have been grouped into a cluster, and thus they are going to be space-translated to form an anonymity set of trajectories. Suppose also d ¼ 1.</p><p>The central trajectory t c is obtained by taking, for each t 2 ½t 1 ,t n , the point (x,y) that is the arithmetic mean of all the points at time t of all trajectories in the cluster. This is t c ¼ /ð3:33,3,0Þ,ð5,1:5,2Þ,ð6,6,5ÞS.</p><p>When d ¼ 0 is assumed (i.e., all trajectories are translated to the central trajectory), the TTD cost (Definition 4) computes to 18.21. When d ¼ 1 is enforced, points move from the cluster center to the disk perimeter as explained above (recall that the disk's radius is d=2Þ.  The method is generic since it allows different approaches and heuristics in the first step. Thus, the most important issue we face now, is how to find the best candidate optimal clustering. Unfortunately, the number of all such clusterings is exponential in the size of D T . So, we need to resort to sub-optimal clustering schemes.</p><p>This simple method is the skeleton of both NWA and W4M as explained in the rest of the paper. However, in the case of W4M the technique applied is not simply space translation but it is translation in both space and time. In fact when matching two different trajectories, the points of one can be matched to points of the other that appear slightly sooner or later in time. Then between matched points, space translation is applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The NWA algorithm</head><p>In order to assess which clustering approach is most suitable for our purposes, we have extended a large variety of well known clustering schemes to make them handle trajectories and the constraint that each cluster must have a population of at least k and at most 2kÀ 1 elements.</p><p>We have prototyped and experimentally compared: hierarchical divisive and hierarchical agglomerative clustering, k-means, greedy clustering, mixture of Gaussian, and density based clustering.

Pre-processing: Aimed at enforcing larger equivalence classes of trajectories w.r.t. same time span; 2. Clustering: Based on GC method and enhanced with techniques to keep low the radius of produced clusters, at the price of suppressing some outlier trajectories; 3. Space translation: Transforming each cluster found into a ðk,dÞÀanonymity set (described in Section 3.5).</p><p>The input of the algorithm is a database of trajectories </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Pre-processing</head><p>The fist task of NWA is the partitioning of the input database into equivalence classes w.r.t. time span, i.e., groups containing all the trajectories that have the same starting time and the same ending time.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 3, if performed on the raw input data this often produces a large number of very small equivalence classes, possibly leading to very low quality ðk,dÞÀanonymization. In order to overcome this problem, we developed a simple pre-processing procedure, summarized in Algorithm 3, able to enforce larger equivalence classes at the price of a small information loss.</p><p>The pre-processing is driven by an integer parameter p: only one timestamp every p can be the starting or ending point of a trajectory. For instance, if the original data were sampled at a frequency of 1 min, and p ¼ 10, all trajectories are pre-processed in such a way that they all start and end at full hours plus multiples of 10 min, e.g., 8 am, 8:10 am, 8:20 am, etc. To do that, the first and the last suitable timestamps occurring in each trajectory are detected (lines 3 and 4), and then all the points of the trajectory that do not lay between them are removed (line 6).

When a remaining object cannot be added to any cluster without violating max_radius, it is simply trashed (line 17).</p><p>We notice that this process can lead to solutions with a too large trash, in which case the whole procedure is restarted from scratch relaxing the max_radius constraint (line 18, in our experiments implemented by multiplying max_radius by a factor 1:5), reiterating the operation till a clustering with sufficiently small trash is obtained (line 19). At the end, the set of clusters obtained is returned as output, thus implicitly discarding the trashed trajectories. From another viewpoint, we can see the whole process as a constrained clustering task, where the maximum trash size expresses a hard constraint, while the maximum cluster radius is a soft constraint that can be relaxed as much as needed. Indeed, the initial values of max_radius handles the trade-off between quality and running time, since small values might lead to more compact clusters, but possibly requiring more iterations to reach a feasible value for max_radius. If running time is not a crucial issue, max_radius becomes a non-critical parameter, and can be simply set to very small values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">W4M: time-tolerant anonymization</head><p>We conducted various experiments in order to assess effectiveness and efficiency of NWA (these experiments are thoroughly reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, and later in Section 6). The experimental assessment confirmed that NWA, despite its efficiency, is able to provide (k,d)-anonymization with very low distortion for a wide range of values of d and k, raising only for high values of k in combination with small values of d.</p><p>However, there is still plenty of room for improvements. In particular, the main drawback of NWA seems to be the fact that it is geared on the Euclidean distance function. Euclidean distance is not able to detect similar trajectories with local shifts, such as trajectories that follow a similar path but have certain subpaths slightly shifted in time. Moreover, Euclidean distance can only be defined between trajectories having exactly the same length, thus forcing NWA to require a pre-processing step (Section 4.1) in order to find reasonably populated equivalence classes of trajectories with same time span, at the price of some information loss.</p><p>Driven by these considerations, in the following we develop a novel method based on a time-tolerant distance function and named W4M (Wait for Me). By a very general standpoint, the W4M method (reported in Algorithm 5) is a variant of NWA that uses a time tolerant distance measure, keeping the overall clustering strategy unchanged. The most important benefit is that the use of a time-tolerant distance removes the need of grouping trajectories into equivalence classes of same time span before the clustering. Concretely, this translates in the fact that the pre-processing step of NWA is no longer needed. Moreover, the whole dataset can be processed by a single clustering phase, instead of having one clustering phase for each equivalence class of same time span. On the one hand this is clearly positive for the objective of the quality of the final anonymization, given the larger variety of trajectories to choose from, to create anonymity sets, but on the other hand this represents a big obstacle for efficiency reasons.</p><p>In order to alleviate the computational cost of the clustering we choose the pivot at each iteration randomly, instead of taking the trajectory that is farthest from the last pivot as NWA does (at line 6 of Algorithm 4). This is because selecting the farthest trajectory requires many additional distance computations. Our empirical analysis showed that the impact of this choice on the output quality is modest. For the rest, the clustering procedure W4M clust is essentially equivalent to NWA clust , where the EDR distance measure substitutes the Euclidean distance. The only place where W4M clust still uses Euclidean distance is when checking if a cluster just obtained is acceptable in terms of compactness, in other words, if its radius is not larger than max_radius. This allows to define the max_radius in terms of meters in the space, instead of number of edit operations needed.</p><p>Finally, an important difference between W4M and NWA is given by the second phase, where instead of having the spatial translation of NWA, an ad hoc spatiotemporal editing based on EDR is devised (Section 5.2). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> gives an example of a cluster of trajectories anonymized by W4M on a real-world dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Time-tolerant distance function</head><p>The distance measure among trajectories adopted by W4M is the EDR distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> applied to threedimensional points (space Â time). This is essentially an edit distance where two points match if and only if the difference over each dimension is less than some given thresholds. The EDR between two trajectories s ¼ /s 1 , . . . ,s n S and t ¼ /t 1 , . . . ,t m S is recursively defined as follows: Then the distance is EDRðs,tÞ ¼ 3. This is obtained by matching the first point of s with the second point of t, the second of s with the third of t, and the last one of both. The distance of three results from skipping the first point of t, and skipping the pairs third point of s with fourth point of t, and fourth of s with fifth of t. We leave to the reader the straightforward exercise of applying the recursive definition of the EDR to produce the result.</p><p>The result of EDR is essentially a set of matching points between the two trajectories, and the unmatched points are implicitly deleted. We exploit the fact that EDR is an edit distance, and we use the result of its computation also as a guide on how to perform the last step of the anonymization process, namely the spatio-temporal editing, as explained in detail in the next section. To the best of our knowledge, such concrete and direct use of the EDR distance measure computation for transforming the data has never been proposed before.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Spatio-temporal editing</head><p>After clusters are extracted, each of them is processed separately to produce a (k,d)-anonymous set of trajectories. The key point in this process is that trajectories generally cover different time intervals, i.e., they have different number of points, and therefore to make them indistinguishable we need to add and remove points to/ from some of them.</p><p>Our solution consists in using the pivot of each cluster as reference object (that replaces the average trajectory used in NWA) and editing the other trajectories in order to make them have the same number of points and become co-located with it. In particular, the decision of which points in a trajectory should be removed, and when a new one should be inserted, is performed by following the matching policy adopted by EDR, as explained below.</p><p>The EDR distance selects a sequence of disjoint pairs of points, one for each trajectory, that minimize the number of editing operations. As shown in the example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>(left), the result is that some points are removed from both trajectories, while the others are matched. However, deletions in the pivot trajectory s can be reversed into corresponding point insertions into the other trajectory t, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(right).</head><p>This one-sided editing directly suggests the way to make each trajectory sufficiently close to the pivot and then indistinguishable from all the trajectories in the cluster: (i) translate all the matching points of t towards the corresponding point of s;(ii) simply remove deleted points from t;and (iii) for each insertion create a new point for t within a proper neighborhood of the corresponding point in s. The procedure is summarized in Algorithm 6. Algorithm 6. STedit. The operation EDR_op_sequence (line 1) reconstructs the sequence of operations (removal and matches) required to produce the optimal matching of EDR. When a deletion in the pivot s is required (lines 5-7) a new point instead is added to t, choosing it randomly from a circle or radius d=2 around the corresponding point in s. When the deletion involves t, on the contrary, nothing happens (lines 13-14), implicitly meaning that the point is simply deleted from t.</p><p>Finally, when a match occurs (lines 9-12) the operation transl is applied to move the spatial coordinates of the point t i in t towards the matching point s j in s by the shortest translation required to ensure that their distance is equal to or smaller than d=2. In other words, if t i is already within a circle of radius d=2 around s j , transl keeps t i as it is. Otherwise, t i is translated to a new position, corresponding to the intersection point between the above-mentioned circle and the segment t i s j . Both the newly created and the translated points of t get the temporal coordinate value equal to the corresponding point in s (lines 6 and 10). Example of the effects of spatio-temporal editing over a trajectory is showed in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Optimizations</head><p>The EDR distance has an O(nm) computational cost, n and m being the length of the two trajectories compared. With long trajectories such cost becomes prohibitive, and therefore we have implemented some optimizations aimed at improving k NN queries, based on the idea of computing a distance only if it has the possibility of being smaller than one of the best k met so far during the computation. For this purpose, when EDR is invoked the value of the k-th smallest distance computed so far is used as upper bound, since any distance larger than that value cannot be in the answer set. Then, the following tests are performed, and if any of them succeeds the distance is not computed: the length of the two trajectories t and s differ by more than the upper bound; the spatial bounding boxes of t and s are farther than D:x (on the X-axis) and D:y (on the Y-axis); assuming a constant sample rate for all trajectories, the temporal intersection of the bounding boxes is used to compute the maximal number of points that could match between the trajectories only looking at the temporal dimension. Obviously, that provides only a lower bound of the distance, which is checked to be higher than the upper bound. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Datasets used</head><p>In this article we report experiments of anonymization over two moving objects databases: a real-world trajectory dataset, and a synthetic one.</p><p>The real-world dataset used in this experimentation comes from the GeoPKDD project, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> and contains a set of trajectories obtained by GPS-equipped cars moving in the city of Milan (Italy) during one week in April 2007. After pre-processing it, the dataset contains more than 45k trajectories for approximately 4.7M spatiotemporal points. During the pre-processing we enforced a constant sampling rate of one point every 5 min. We did not use interpolation to reconstruct the missing points: when a point is missing the object is assumed to stay still in the last position observed. We also cut trajectories when two consecutive observations were too far in time (threshold set at 12 h), or in space (threshold set at ca. 20 km). Finally we removed completely noisy trajectories such as trajectories with too short temporal extension, or too small spatial minimum bounding box.</p><p>The second dataset is synthetic and it has been generated using Brinkhoff's network-based generator of moving objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>: it contains 100,000 trajectories and it represents one day movement (144 timestamps, one every 10 min) over the road-network of the city of Oldenburg (Germany). The former dataset is referred as Milan, and the latter as Oldenburg.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1</ref> we report the characteristics of the two datasets. For each dataset D we report: the half-diagonal of the minimum bounding box ðradiusðDÞÞ of the space in D, the number of trajectories ðjDjÞ, the total number of spatio-temporal points, the maximum number of points in one trajectory, and the average step, i.e., the average distance between two consecutive timestamps.</p><p>Although Oldenburg contains more trajectories it is inherently simpler than Milan. As confirmed by our experiments, the large temporal extension of the Milan dataset (one week), the consequent length of trajectories, and the complexity of the city road network, make this dataset a much more challenging anonymization task. In the rest of this section we report experiments conducted on the Oldenburg dataset. Experiments on the Milan dataset will be discussed in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Experimental setting</head><p>We coded our methods in C, and they are available in the corresponding webpages (links are in the first page of this article).

Example of the effects of spatio-temporal editing over a trajectory from the Oldenburg dataset. The left plot shows the original trajectory, its pivot, and the resulting anonymized trajectory.

Also the max_radius is set to the same value (5000 m), for both NWA and W4M. It is worth recalling that even if W4M uses EDR distance, it computes the radius as the maximum space translation needed, i.e., the maximum Euclidean distance between a point and its matching point in the pivot. Finally, the triple D of tolerance thresholds necessary in the definition of the EDR, are defined as functions of d, since this is the input parameter of uncertainty of our problem. We wanted the uncertainty parameter values to be dependent on the application driven parameter d and statistics from the input database.</p><p>In particular, dx and dy are set to 4 times d while dt ¼ 4 Ã d=average_speed, where average_speed is the average speed of all moving objects in the dataset to be anonymized.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Discernibility metrics</head><p>An interesting metric introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is discernibility, that measures the data quality of the anonymized dataset based on the size of each anonymity set. Given a clustering P ¼ fp 1 , . . . ,p n g of D, where p n represents the trash bin, the discernibility metric is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">DMðDÞ ¼ X nÀ1 i ¼ 1 jp i j 2 þjp n jjDj:</formula><p>Intuitively, discernibility represents the fact that data quality shrinks as more data elements become indistinguishable. Comparison between W4M and NWA is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7(a)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that, since discernibility only captures the clustering step of our method, and not the space translation, in NWA this measure is independent from d. Instead in W4M discernibility depends from on d only because the three thresholds necessary in the definition of the EDR, have been chosen as a function of d. We can notice that neither NWA nor W4M produces solutions exhibiting monotone discernibility w.r.t. k: this is due to the strong influence of the size of the trash (i.e., the number of suppressed trajectories, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7(b)</ref>) on discernibility. Indeed, discernibility grows with the trash, until the trash breaks the limit (i.e., Max_Trash): at that point max_radius is enlarged, and thus the number of suppressed trajectories shrinks making fall down also the discernibility metric (as visible at k ¼ 50 for d ¼ 600 and 1000).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Range query distortion</head><p>Since discernibility largely depends on the number of suppressed trajectories, and since it only captures the clustering step and not the real distortion introduced in the anonymization, we need a more direct measure of such distortion.</p><p>The purpose of releasing data is usually to query or to analyze it, therefore the best way of measuring utility is to compare the results between queries evaluated on the original dataset D and its (k,d)-anonymized version D 0 . In the following we report such comparison adopting spatiotemporal range queries with uncertainty according to the model by Trajcevski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The same model is also at the basis of our problem definition in Section 1. Therefore, the same uncertainty level d at the basis of our framework, is both used in the (k,d)-anonymization process and in the querying process for evaluation purposes.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Trajcevski et al. introduce a set of six (Boolean) predicates that give a qualitative description of the relative position of a moving object t with respect to a region R, within a given time interval ½t b ,t e . In particular we are interested in the condition insideðR,tÞ. Since the location of the object changes continuously, we may ask if such condition is satisfied sometime or always within ½t b ,t e ; moreover, due to the uncertainty, the object may possibly satisfy the condition or it may definitely do so, at a particular timestamp t 2 ½t b ,t e .</p><p>If there exists some possible motion curve f PMC t (recall Definition 1) which at the time t is inside the region R, there is a possibility that the moving object will take f PMC t as its actual motion and will be inside R at t. However, the moving object may have chosen another possible motion curve as its actual motion. Similarly, if every possible motion curve f PMC t is inside the region R at the time t, then regardless of which one describes the actual object's motion, the object is guaranteed to be inside the region R at time t. Thus, we have two domains of quantification, with two quantifiers in each. In the following, we focus only on the two extreme cases, namely Possibly_Some-time_Inside (P_S_I), corresponding to a double (, and Definitely_Always_Inside (D_A_I), corresponding to a double 8. More formally:</p><p>Possibly_Sometime_Insideðt,R,t b ,t e Þ ð(f PMC t Þð(t 2 ½t b ,t e ÞinsideðR,f PMC t ðtÞ,tÞ, Definitely_Always_Insideðt,R,t b ,t e Þ ð8f PMC t Þð8t 2 ½t b ,t e ÞinsideðR,f PMC t ðtÞ,tÞ:</p><p>In the experiments, we compared the results of the following queries over D and its (k,d)-anonymized version</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D 0 .

The results are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>(a) and (b). For both range queries, W4M clearly outperforms NWA. In particular, W4M keeps the distortion of Q 1 consistently below 10% for all parameter settings, while the performances of NWA, initially very good for small values of k, quickly decay for medium and large k values. A similar behavior is experienced with Q 2 , though it looks more sensible to trajectory translations, and therefore the distortion induced by W4M reaches 20% for k= 50 and approaches 40% for k =100. In contrast, NWA reaches a 100% distortion already for k=25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Distortion of mining results</head><p>The usability of the anonymized data is measured with respect to data mining tasks, and, more exactly, sequential patterns. The original geographical space is discretized into rectangular regions, obtained by creating a regular grid of 25 Â 25 cells that partitions the bounding box of the area covered by the data. Then, each input trajectory is translated to the sequence of regions it traverses. The same preparation process is applied to original and anonymized datasets, then a standard sequential pattern extraction tool is applied to each resulting dataset, with the same minimum support threshold, set to 1%. On the original dataset that originates 8934 frequent patterns. The sets of patterns obtained on the anonymized datasets are then compared against the patterns extracted from the original data. The matching level between each set S 0 of sequential patterns extracted from anonymized data and the set S extracted from the original data is computed through the F-measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, a standard quality measure adopted in information retrieval and computed as the harmonic mean (2ab=ða þ bÞ) of precision (a ¼ jS 0 \ Sj=jS 0 j) and recall (b ¼ jS 0 \ Sj=jSj) of the first set over the second one. The results, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8(d)</ref>, confirm that W4M is able to preserve sequential patterns much better than NWA: the former achieves an F-measure above 80% with k=10 and close to 60% for k=25, whereas NWA drops to around 10% for k=10 and close to zero for higher values of k. 6.6. Runtime Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8(c</ref>) reports a runtime comparison between W4M and NWA. The plot (drawn in log-scale for readability reasons) clearly shows that W4M is much slower, up to almost two orders of magnitude for large values of k. Thus in the next section we devise methods to reduce this gap, making W4M feasible even on very large datasets, without giving up quality in the anonymization process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Scaling to large databases</head><p>Algorithm W4M faces two main computational challenges: (i) pairwise distance computation between trajectories, and (ii) quadratic time (w.r.t. trajectory length) of each pairwise distance computation. In other terms, the algorithm is quadratic both on the number of trajectories (that we call the horizontal dimension) and the mean trajectory length (vertical dimension). Although some optimizations are already done on W4M as given in Section 5.3, the algorithm is still impractical with very large MODs containing too many trajectories, or too long trajectories, or both. For instance, the large temporal extension of the Milan dataset (one week), and the consequent length of trajectories, make W4M unsuitable to anonymize this dataset.</p><p>In the sequel, while keeping W4M as our reference algorithm, we develop techniques to reduce (i) quadratic time on vertical dimension to linear time, and (ii) quadratic time on horizontal dimension to sub-quadratic time. The first one is achieved through a new spatiotemporal distance function, called LSTD, introduced in Section 7.1, which has linear complexity w.r.t. the size of the trajectories. The second one is achieved through chunking, i.e., pre-clustering of original set of trajectories as explained in Section 7.2. Since chunking in any case requires distance computation, we adopt an O(1) rough pairwise trajectory distance.</p><p>In Section 8 we will show that these techniques succeed in the goal of making W4M scalable to large MODs, without giving up quality of the anonymization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">A linear time time-tolerant distance function</head><p>In the following we introduce a new spatio-temporal distance function, called LSTD, directly by describing the algorithm to compute it.</p><p>Let t 1 and t 2 be two trajectories of length n and m, respectively, i.e., containing jt 1 j ¼ n and jt 2 j ¼ m spatiotemporal points.

The algorithm first matches the first points of the trajectories and updates the last matched pairs of ST-points, denoted i last ,j last . Then, starting from the last match, either one or both trajectories are progressed by one point, and the last match is updated accordingly. This continues until all the points in both trajectories are matched. The total LSTD is then the sum of pairwise distances between matched points.

Since each point is three-dimensional and the units of the spatial and temporal dimensions differ, the classical Euclidean distance will hardly work due to scaling problem. Thus we map each point ðx,y,tÞ to a point ðx 0 ,y 0 ,zÞ in a three-dimensional space where the unit of x 0 , y 0 and z is that of x and y. The mapping of x 0 and y 0 is based on minimum bounding rectangle, MBR, of trajectory set. Let xmin ¼ lowerXcoordinateðMBRÞ and ymin ¼ lowerYcoordinateðMBRÞ, then x 0 ¼ xÀxmin and y 0 ¼ yÀymin.</p><p>Since, t is on the temporal dimension while z needs to have a spatial unit, we devise the following transformation. The idea is that using the trajectory points we can compute the overall average speed of all objects. Let this speed be v, then z ¼ v Á ðtÀtminÞ, where the tmin is the minimum time value over all trajectories in the database. The notion of xmin, ymin and tmin create a threedimensional cartesian coordinate system where (xmin, ymin, tmin) is the origin. Having done this mapping we are able to use Euclidean distance now to compute PDistðt 1 ½i,t 2 ½j,dÞ.</p><p>Since, the notion of distance needed to be in the anonymity set of each other is geared on d, we require points within a distance of d to have PDist value of zero. To formalize this, let ed ¼ Euclidðt 1 ½i,t 2 ½jÞ be the Euclidean distance between t 1 ½i and t 2 ½j, then PDistðt 1 ½i,t 2 ½j,dÞ is a discretized truncated distance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">PDistðt 1 ½i,t 2 ½j,dÞ ¼ min ed d ,M</formula><p>:</p><p>The distance PDistðt 1 ½i,t 2 ½j,dÞ must be interpreted as a quantization of the actual distance between t 1 ½i,t 2 ½j for a given uncertainty value d. For instance, when PDistðt 1 ½i,t 2 ½j,dÞ ¼ 0 the two points are within uncertainty disk of each other, when PDistðt 1 ½i,t 2 ½j,dÞ ¼ 1, they are one uncertainty disk away from each other and so on. We truncate this distance after a certain threshold M, to prevent some potentially outlier points from having overimpact on the distance itself. The value of M may be a user parameter, even if, in concrete, we always use M= 10. Like EDR distance, LSTD (Algorithm 7) is both used in clustering step and point translation step. The use of LSTD for clustering step is obvious as it returns a distance given any two trajectories. For the translation step, note that matched points can be easily returned as output by the algorithm, and then be used to shift one trajectory towards the other. Therefore the spatio-temporal editing can be applied the same way as described in Section 5.2.</p><p>EDR and other similar distance measures, including DTW (dynamic time warping) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> and LCSS (longest common subsequences) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, are all based on minimum number of edit operations to make two (symbolic or real) sequences equal. But in our case, rather than the number of edit operations, the magnitude of edits is important. By this perspective, LSTD is a sort of edit distance that cares also about the magnitude of the needed spatio-temporal translation, closer in spirit to ERP (Edit distance with Real Penalty) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, another variant of EDR that shares its same computational issues but directly takes into consideration the distance between points. Indeed, LSTD can be seen as a greedy variant of ERP that trades global optimality of the matching with linear cost. Thus, LSTD utility is not confined to its efficiency, but it is also given by its direct relation to the problem definition. Finally, we notice that, given the different viewpoints adopted by EDR and LSTD, no direct relation between the values of the two measures is easily derivable.</p><p>On the efficiency side, LSTD has the same complexity of Euclidean distance (as it is also linear) between trajectories. However, the drawback of Euclidean distance is its inapplicability to trajectories having differing lengths, while this is not a problem for LSTD. Moreover, Euclidean distance is sensitive to outliers while LSTD is not, thanks to the truncation technique.</p><p>In the following we denote W4M L the variant of W4M which adopts LSTD distance instead of EDR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Chunking</head><p>Our approach to deal with large databases consists in dividing the database into chunks, and treating each chunk as a separate database. After the chunking is complete, each chunk is then independently anonymized using W4M L , i.e., W4M with LSTD distance.</p><p>The simplest strategy for chunking is to randomly assigning trajectories to chunks. Clearly this approach, though very efficient, may produce very heterogenous chunks as similar trajectories will most likely be dispersed among chunks. As a result this strategy overly distorts the published data quality. Instead our strategy, named W4M L C , is based on partitioning the original database into large chunks using a simple trajectory distance computation. The objective is to put similar trajectories into the same chunk to reduce the data distortion. Obviously, this problem is as difficult as directly anonymizing the original database as pairwise distances between trajectories must be computed in order to put similar trajectories into the same chunk. We solve this problem by introducing an O(1) time pairwise trajectory distance computation, as explained next.</p><p>The distance function we adopt is essentially a comparison of the three-dimensional spatio-temporal bounding boxes of the two trajectories.

We coded our methods in C, and they are available in the corresponding webpages (links are in the first page of this article). All the experiments were performed on a Intel Xeon 2 GHz processor with 1 Gb of RAM over a Linux 2.6.14 platform. The settings of the experiments on the Oldenburg dataset that we report in the following are the same as described previously in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Oldenburg dataset</head><p>Figs. 9 and 10 report run-time and range query distortion, respectively. It is immediately evident that the techniques, that we have introduced in Section 7 for efficiency purpose, achieve the intended goal of providing scalability without giving up quality of the data in the anonymized database. In particular, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>(a) W4M L C exhibits one order of magnitude speed-up over the standard W4M on anonymizing the Oldenburg dataset.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Oldenburg dataset contains rather short trajectories. Given the quadratic behavior of EDR w.r.t. the length of trajectories, the gap in efficiency between the two methods is expected to grow with the length of trajectories. This is confirmed by the comparison in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>(b) where we anonymize only a subset of the Oldenburg dataset containing the 8000 longest trajectories: in this task, W4M L C is two orders of magnitude faster than EDR-based W4M.</p><p>This gain in efficiency is not paid in terms of quality of the anonymization. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>, the distortion introduced by W4M and W4M L C is always very close. For Possibly_Sometime_Inside range queries both methods have a distortion below 0.1 for all values of k and d, while NWA exhibits a distortion that grows up to 0.7 for large values of k. Instead for Definitely_Always_Inside range queries the distortion introduced by both W4M and W4M L C grows to between 0.4 and 0.5 for k=50 and larger.</p><p>Two observations are worth. First, W4M L C behaves extremely well, being in some cases surprisingly better than EDR-based W4M. The second observation is that W4M L , i.e., the version with LSTD but without chunking, performs always worse than both W4M and W4M L C . This clearly indicates a positive synergy of the two techniques: the chunking based pre-processing avoids LSTD to perform some poor trajectories grouping afterwards.</p><p>From the perspective of mining tasks, the results are slightly different, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>. In this case, we can see that performances, expressed in terms of F-measure, generally improve with W4M L , while chunking introduces some loss of quality, though rather limited.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> provides further insight in the behavior of the W4M family of methods. It reports statistics about the spatio-temporal editing phase, for those trajectories that are not trashed by the clustering phase (number of trajectories identified as outliers, and thus removed, are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>(i), (j)). We can observe that W4M always performs the smallest number of points creations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12(a)</ref>, (e)) and points deletions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>(b), (f)), while W4M L C performs less points creation but more points deletion than W4M L . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12(c</ref>) and (g) report the average temporal translation, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12(d</ref>) and (h) the average spatial translation. Interestingly W4M L performs little spatial translations, while it performs rather large temporal translations. Also in this case W4M L C behaves more similarly to W4M than to W4M L , confirming the results obtained for range queries distortion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">Milan dataset</head><p>The large temporal extension of the Milan dataset (one week), the consequent length of trajectories, and the complexity of the city road network, made it unpractical to apply the basic EDR-based W4M algorithm, due to its high computational cost. Therefore, in the following we report experimental results using only W4M L C . The parameters used are Max_Trash ¼ 10% of the dataset, and initial max_radius ¼ 2000 (2 km).</p><p>This real-world dataset is not only more challenging computationally, but it is also an harder anonymization task: trajectories are much more complex and heterogeneous both in space and time, making very difficult to preserve the data quality in the anonymization process. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref> summarizes the results. In the first row of plots we report the effects of the spatio-temporal editing. The number of created and removed points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref> grows with larger k and smaller d as expected, and it is rather high being approximately around 1  9 of the total number of points in the input database for k= 50. However  points created and removed by the spatio-temporal editing are in the same order, thus balancing the total effect. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13(c</ref>) shows average spatial translation being between 4 and 6 km for k=50 and being larger for smaller d. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13(d)</ref> shows average temporal translation being almost always between 1 and 2 h for k= 50, while being much smaller for small k, and much larger for k= 100 when d is small. The number of trajectories trashed by the algorithm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13(e)</ref>) decreases for larger k, apparently suggesting that larger values of k make it easier to form groups of limited diameter. This is due to chunks size in the chunking pre-processing being a multiple of k: with larger k, the larger variety of trajectories in each chunk can abundantly balance the stronger density constraints imposed over clusters.</p><p>Run time, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>(f), grows linearly w.r.t. k, and is almost independent from d. This confirms the theoretical evaluation of the complexity of W4M L C : the Finally, the effects of anonymization on the extraction of frequent sequential patterns is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15(a)-(c</ref>). In this case, a minimum support threshold of 0.35% was adopted, yielding 8204 frequent patterns on the original dataset. The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15</ref>(a) are coherent with those obtained over the Oldenburg dataset, showing an Fmeasure that is very high for small values of K, keeping above 50% for K =30 and most values of d (all excepted 200, the smallest one). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15(b)</ref> shows the precision obtained on the same experiments, i.e., the ratio of patterns obtained on the anonymized dataset that were already present in the original data, while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15(c</ref>) shows recall or coverage, i.e., the ratio of patterns present in the original data that were preserved by anonymization. In both cases we have very high performances for small values of K, especially in the case of coverage, which are kept around or above a sound 40% for values of K up to 50, confirming the good quality preservation achieved by the W4M approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusions, extensions and open issues</head><p>We studied the problem of anonymity preserving data publishing in moving objects databases and introduced the concept of (k,d)-anonymity, that exploits the inherent uncertainty of location in order to reduce the amount of distortion needed to anonymize data. We deeply characterized the problem and developed various methods to solve it. In particular we first recalled our previous proposal NWA which is essentially a greedy clustering method for trajectories equipped with ad hoc preprocessing and techniques to produce compact clusters at the price of suppressing some outliers. Starting from a discussion on the limits of NWA, we then developed a novel method ðW4MÞ that, being based on EDR distance, has the important feature of being time-tolerant. W4M embeds various interesting techniques. To the best of our knowledge our algorithm is the first to use EDR as distance function within a trajectory clustering framework, thus providing further assessment of the merits of this distance. Another novel idea that we introduced is to exploit the EDR computation also as a guide on how to perform the last step of the anonymization process, i.e., the spatio-temporal editing. Faced with the quadratic complexity of W4M, we developed techniques aiming at making it scalable, without giving up quality of the result. In particular, we reduced (i) the quadratic time of the distance computation to linear time, and (ii) the quadratic time on the number of trajectories to sub-quadratic time. The first was achieved through the introduction of a novel spatio-temporal distance function, named LSTD, while the second was achieved by means of chunking (i.e., pre-clustering) of original set of trajectories. The introduction of LSTD measure for trajectories has its own merits. Being linear, LSTD has the same computational cost of Euclidean distance, but it has not the same limits: in fact LSTD is time-tolerant, can be applied to trajectories of different length, and it is tolerant to outliers. Indeed, it represents a good practical trade-off between Euclidean and EDR.</p><p>We performed an extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Data quality was assessed both by means of objective measures of information distortion and by more usability oriented measure, i.e., by comparing the results of spatio-temporal range queries and frequent pattern mining, executed on the original database and on the anonymized one. Experimental results confirmed what was expected: (i) that W4M provides better quality anonymization than its predecessor NWA, but it is computationally more expensive; (ii) that W4M evolution with LSTD and chunking is much more scalable than EDR-based W4M while achieving similar levels of quality in the anonymization. One interesting result of our experiments is that anonymizing the real-world dataset is a much more challenging task than the synthetic one. This result highlights the need of having more real-world MODs available for researchers working in the area.</p><p>Although experimental results show that our method introduces reasonable distortion, there is still room for improvements. In particular, we aim at devising more sophisticated techniques to automatically handle the trade-off between cluster radius and trash size.</p><p>In this article we assumed a uniform uncertainty level d for all the moving points. In some applications this could not be the case, and different moving objects could have different uncertainty level d. Our method can be straightforwardly extended to deal with this situation by taking, for each cluster, the minimum d appearing in the cluster.</p><p>However, more sophisticated techniques should be devised.</p><p>One limitation of our work is that we do not keep directly in consideration, as possible background knowledge, the road network <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. In particular, in the space  translation step in NWA an hypothetical mean trajectory is computed for each cluster, and all trajectories within the cluster are space translated towards the mean. The motivation with the mean trajectory is to minimize the translation distortion (Lemma 1). Although the mean trajectory technique makes sense with free terrain movement model, in the road network model the mean trajectory might violate the road constraint. One possible solution to enforce the road network constraint is to use the median trajectory instead of the mean trajectory in the space translation step. We define the median trajectory (of a cluster) as the closest trajectory to the mean. For W4M we do not need any change as it is already geared on the pivot, which is an existing trajectory in the MOD.</p><p>Obviously the inherent uncertainty d of the system, might make some trajectories violate the road network, as it happens sometimes with GPS navigator systems. We believe that directly including the road network constraint in MOD anonymization problem formulations will open up interesting research directions; as in privacy aware mobile services <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and knowledge hiding in MOD <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>It has been recently recognized (e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and in many other papers) that k-anonymity alone does not put us on the safe side, because although one individual is hidden in a group (thanks to equal values of the quasiidentifiers), if the group has not enough diversity of the sensitive attributes then an attacker can still associate one individual to sensitive information. Also in the MOD context, if we are able to know that one individual belongs to a group, even if we are not able to identify exactly his trajectory, we can still discover some sensitive information. However, in the context of moving object data the problem is very challenging, because position is a peculiar kind of information that could be considered to be sensitive and quasi-identifier at the same time. Therefore, since anonymity requires similarity on the quasiidentifiers, and diversity requires dissimilarity on the sensitive information, it seems that in the case of moving object data they are two conflicting goals. In this paper we did not consider any concept of quasi-identifier for trajectories, and thus we did not tackle the diversity problem: these are interesting and open research problems that deserve deep investigation.</p><p>Finally, finding a realistic and actionable definition of quasi-identifiers in the MOD context, as well as devising methodologies to derive them, are important open problems. most 4m for ðk ¼ 3,d ¼ 0ÞÀanonymity on D. To prove the claim we first give the following lemma: Lemma 2. For any subset of rows with cardinality t, the minimum translation cost for a column with q number of 1's and (t À q) number of 0's is 2 Á q Á ðtÀqÞ=t.</p><p>Proof. Since the mean of the subset for the column is q/t and d ¼ 0, translation distortion cost for the subset on the column is the q Á ð1Àq=tÞþðtÀqÞ Á q=t ¼ 2 Á ðq Á ðtÀqÞ=t.</p><p>The distortion cost evaluates to zero (which is the minimum cost possible) when the column is homogenous (contains all 0's or 1's). Moreover, for the heterogenous case (mixture of at least one 1 and at least one 0), the minimum is obtained when there is either exactly one 1 or exactly one 0. In that case, the distortion cost evaluates to 2 Á ðtÀ1Þ=t. &amp; Direction: Edge Partition ) ðk,dÞÀanonymity: In case G is a collection of triangles and 4-stars, (k ¼ 3,d ¼ 0)anonymity can be obtained with at most the distortion of m Á 3 Á 2 Á ðtÀ1Þ=t ¼ m Á 3 Á 2 Á 2 3 ¼ 4m. This is because every triangle and 4-star have exactly the same cost of 3 Á 2 Á ð2Þ</p><p>3 and there are exactly m such structures. Recall that from Lemma 2 each column of a triangle or 4-star contributes to distortion cost either 0 (homogenous columns) or 2 Á 2 3 (heterogenous columns, two 1's and one 0 or vice versa) and there are three heterogeneous columns.</p><p>Direction: Edge Partition ( ðk,dÞÀanonymity: Suppose there is a (k ¼ 3,d ¼ 0)-anonymity solution with at most 4m distortion cost. Since any three rows differ at least in three columns, the solution should have at least m Á 3 Á 2 Á 2 3 ¼ 4m distortion cost. In case there are solutions which group more than three rows, i.e., t 4 3, they must have at least t heterogenous columns and the minimum possible cost of such grouping is t Á 2 Á ðtÀ1Þ=t. The average distortion per row is then ð1=tÞ Á t Á 2 Á ðtÀ1Þ=t ¼ 2 Á ðtÀ1Þ=t which is minimized when t =4 with the average cost of 3  2 ¼ 1:5. This is the lowest distortion per row of any such setting. Recalling that the minimum distortion per row when t =3 is 4  3 ¼ 1:33, hence the total distortion of 4m is possible only when t = 3 and there are m such groupings.</p><p>This concludes that there is an exactly TTD=4m solution for (k ¼ 3,d ¼ 0)-anonymity iff the G is a collection of triangles and 4-stars.</p><p>Since we want a reduction from the edge partition into triangles, we need 4-stars to give more distortion than triangles do. In the sequel we show the equivalence of (k ¼ 3,d ¼ 0)-anonymity to edge partition into triangles.</p><p>Equivalence to Edge Partition into Triangles: The reduction is as follows. We replicate the columns of D (constructed above) all together where each replication is called a block and initialize all entries with 0's. The number of blocks is l ¼ 2 Á dlg 2 ð3m þ 1Þe and therefore the number of columns is 2 Á jVj Á l. Labels are assigned as explained before and replicated as well. For any arbitrary ordering of edges (from 1 to 3m) we assign the respective binary number to the edge. For instance, if m= 100, then the edge with the ordinal 5 is assigned with the binary code of 000000101. Then we append binary codes with complements. In the above example, for instance, the code becomes 000000101111111010. Note that, the length of all the codes are equal to the number of blocks l. For each row, each block is either in configuration 0 or 1 and it is decided based on the binary code of the edge. For instance, in the above example the edge with ordinal 5 is in configuration 0 in blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16 and 18 while in 1 in blocks <ref type="bibr">7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17.</ref> For each row corresponding to the edge e ¼ ðv,uÞ 2 E and for each block, we put 1 to the entry v x and 2 to the entry u x in configuration 0, but 2 to the entry v x and 1 to the entry u x in configuration 1.</p><p>We claim that G is a collection of only triangles iff the minimum translation distortion (TTD) cost is at most 6ml for ðk ¼ 3,d ¼ 0Þ-anonymity.  Direction: Edge Partition ) ðk,dÞ-anonymity: In any block, there are eight possible configurations for any triplets of rows, from binary 000 to 111 where the first digit is the configuration of first edge, and so on. All possible triplet configurations for a triangle are illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">2</ref> with distortion costs. As it is clear from the table, each block has distortion cost of exactly 6. Since we have m triplets and l blocks we have a ðk ¼ 3,d ¼ 0ÞÀanonymity solution with cost at most 6ml where each triangle contributes exactly 6l.</p><p>Direction: Edge Partition ( ðk,dÞ-anonymity: Here, we show that any 4-star contributes distortion cost larger than 6l. We construct a table similar to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">2</ref> for a 4star.</p><p>Recall that our reduction always pairs a configuration with its complement. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">3</ref>, the minimum distortion of 4-star is obtained when the configuration is 000 or 111, the average value is (8+ 4)/2= 6. In this case, the cost is exactly the same as to the triangles. In other words, the theoretical limit for a 4-star is at least 6l. However, this limit cannot be reached because of the reduction as edges are assigned different binary codes and they should switch to some heterogenous configuration (other than 000 and 111) more than once, otherwise they should have the same binary code which is by construction impossible. For any switching case, note that sum of any complementing pairs in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">3</ref> (which is 8+ 6.67= 14.67) is greater than the respective sum in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">2</ref> (which is 6+ <ref type="bibr">6= 12)</ref>. Therefore, the distortion should be larger than 6l for any 4-star.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A</head><p>In the following we provide the proof of Theorem 1: (k,d)-anonymity by point suppression problem is NP-hard.</p><p>Proof. NP-hardness of k-anonymity by attribute suppression for transactional data has been proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, by reduction from the Edge Partition Into Triangles problem. Our proof is a simple reduction from the k-anonymity with attribute suppression that is defined as follows: given transaction database D r and anonymity threshold k obtain k-anonymous variant of D r by introducing minimum number of suppressions. We obtain the instance of (k,d)-anonymity with point suppression problem by setting D T ¼ sðD r Þ,d ¼ 0 and T ¼ ½t 1 , . . . ,t m where m is the number of attributes in D r , and s : R-R Â R is element-wise dimension augmentation operator such that sðxÞ ¼ ðx,0Þ. The intuition is to treat each column in D r as the x dimension of a spatial point and adding a fake y dimension whose value is always 0. Under this reduction these two problems become the same. &amp;</p><p>In the following we provide the proof of Lemma 1: with space translation of points, the minimum distortion is obtained by moving all points to the mean of the cluster.</p><p>Proof. From Definition 4 we observe that translation distortion TD decomposes (as summations) across the clusters ðP ¼ fp 1 , . . . ,p n gÞ and also across timestamps ðt 2 TÞ. Therefore, it suffices to address independently the cost contribution of any cluster at any timestamp to TD. Additionally, constraining d ¼ 0 implies that locations of trajectories within any cluster should be moved to the same point at any t 2 T. Thus in this setting we have a set of two dimensional points to be clustered. The analytical minimization of the well-known least-square of errors gives that cluster center is the mean point. &amp;</p><p>In the following we provide the proof of Theorem 2: ðk,dÞ-anonymity by Space Translation problem is NP-Hard.</p><p>Proof. Our proof is based on a reduction from the Edge Partition into Triangles problem which is defined as follows. Given a graph G=(V,E) such that jEj ¼ 3m, the problem asks whether there is a way of partitioning edges into m triangles. For convenience, we first show the equivalence to edge partition into triangles and 4-stars and then we show the equivalence to edge partition into triangles. &amp; Equivalence to Edge Partition into Triangles and 4-stars:</p><p>The reduction is very similar to Aggarwal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> as given next. From the graph G, D with 3m rows are created (one row for each edge). For each of the vertices v 2 V, we create two consecutive columns referred v x and v y . The table is initialized with all 0's. For each row, we put 1's to the entries v x and u x if the corresponding edge is e ¼ ðv,uÞ 2 E. So, this way each row contains two 1's and the table contains 6m 1's. Anonymity threshold is set to k= 3 and uncertainty threshold is set to d ¼ 0.</p><p>We claim that G is a collection of triangles and 4-stars iff the minimum translation distortion (TTD) cost is at</p></div>			</div>
