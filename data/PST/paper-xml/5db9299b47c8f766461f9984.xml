			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Image segmentation is a vital and fundamental step in Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). Many multiscale segmentation algorithms have been widely used in high resolution (HR) remote sensing images. These segmentation algorithms need a preset parameter, named scale parameter, to control the average size of each object. However, due to the spatial variation, single scale parameter can hardly describe the boundaries of regions with different land covers. To overcome this limitation, in this study, an adaptive parameter optimization method is proposed for multiscale segmentation. To find the optimal scale of objects, a local spectral heterogeneity measure is applied by calculating the spectral angle between inter and intra objects. Different from selecting a global optimal scale parameter, this study aims to directly search the optimal objects from results of all different scales and combine them into final segmentation results. In experiments, a multi-resolution segmentation is used to generate segmentation results of different scales and the QuickBird-2 images are used as test data. Optimization results over four HR test images reveal that the proposed method provides better segmentation performance than single scale segmentation result.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>With the rapid development of remote sensing image technology, more and more high resolution (HR) remote sensing imageries have been acquired and processed. Pixel-based methods are first used in remote sensing image processing by distinguishing land covers with the spectral reflectance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pu and Landry, 2012)</ref>. However, the pixel-based methods fail to exploit the spatial variation in HR images because the relations between neighboring pixels are usually ignored. Therefore, the (Geographic) Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA or GEOBIA) has emerged and become an effective approach in HR image analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hossain and Chen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ma et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blaschke et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>GEOBIA-based methods consider image objects instead of pixels as basic analysis units <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref>. The purpose of GEOBIA is to address the complicated spatial and hierarchical relationships in the HR image classification process <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ma et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dronova, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Costa et al., 2017)</ref>. As a vital and fundamental step in GEOBIA, image segmentation aims to divide the pixels into several homogeneous regions. These regions are recognized as objects of GEOBIA and usually represent a kind of land covers such as farm lands, buildings and water bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Yang et al., 2015a)</ref>. Therefore, the segmentation performance has a critical effect on the later steps of GEOBIA, including object feature extraction and classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gonçalves et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>There are a number of HR image segmentation algorithms proposed and utilized in GEOBIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Liu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Grinias et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Troya-Galvis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Comaniciu and Meer, 2002)</ref>. For example, watershed segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Li et al., 2010)</ref>, hybrid segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref> and multi-resolution segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Benz et al., 2004)</ref> have been widely used to generate image objects in GEOBIA. Most of these segmentation algorithms need to assign a scale parameter to control the size of objects. However, due to the spatial variations in HR images, it is difficult for users to select an appropriate scale for segmentation. The selection of scale parameter usually depends on the trial-and-error method.</p><p>To select an appropriate scale for segmentation, researchers proposed a variety of scale optimization methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Georganos et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hu et al., 2018)</ref>. Theses scale optimization methods usually can be divided into two groups: supervised and unsupervised methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Grybas et al., 2017)</ref>. Supervised scale optimization methods are designed to measure the similarity between segmentation objects and the reference objects (usually hand digitized by user) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tian and Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cardoso and Corte-Real, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Witharana et al., 2014)</ref>. The optimal parameter is selected based on the segmentation results that are most similar to the reference segmentation objects. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Witharana and Civco (2014)</ref> measures the discrepancy by Euclidean distance 2 (ED2) to discriminate the quality of image objects. The optimal scale is selected when the ED2 is close to zero. Unfortunately, it is always time-consuming to generate the reference objects for supervised scale optimization. Thus, researchers start to focus on unsupervised approaches. The unsupervised approaches do not use reference objects and tend to design a measure to evaluate the quality of segmentation results at different scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Espindola et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Karl and Maurer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stein and de Beurs, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Zhou et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Georganos et al., 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hu et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, it is a key step to design an appropriate measurement for optimization methods. For example, the intra-region homogeneity and inter-region heterogeneity are employed as measurements to search the suitable objects until some conditions are satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Drǎguţ et al., 2010)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Yang et al. (2015b)</ref>, the average local variance of objects is introduced to measure the object homogeneity. However, the single scale parameter selected by the optimization methods still cannot satisfy the segmentation need due to the varying land covers of HR images. In some condition, the objects could be limited by the same scale parameter, no matter how homogeneous these objects are when compared with other objects. Ideally, the scale parameter should be adaptive to different regions or land covers. Specifically, in the urban area of an HR image, the scale parameter could be small to fit the building objects; while in the sea or water bodies, the scale parameter might be relatively large.</p><p>Recently, to overcome the limitation of single scale parameter, the cross-scale strategy has emerged and drawn attention in the scale optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Johnson and Xie, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhang et al., 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al., 2009)</ref>. This strategy aims at fusing the multiple scale segmentation objects and generate a comprehensive segmentation results with adaptive scales at different land covers. At present, two groups of solutions are applied for multiscale optimization. One solution is to introduce land-cover categories to guide the selection of optimal scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Myint et al., 2011)</ref>. The optimal scales are obtained in different land cover categories and then synthesized as a multiscale segmentation results <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Yi et al., 2012)</ref>. The drawback of this method is that the land cover categories are difficult to obtain because we need either supervised information or classification rules in advance. Another solution is to select an initial scale to refine the single-scale segmentation Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Flowchart of proposed optimization method. The s represent an object for calculating the local spectral heterogeneity and x i denotes the adjacent object. The p and q are merged as object s in current scale. results <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Xiao et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Johnson and Xie (2011)</ref>, a global optimal scale is first selected from multiscale segmentation results. Then the improvement is conducted on under-segmentation and over-segmentation regions, respectively. At last, an optimal segmentation result can be combined with the improved segmentation regions. More recently, Su (2019) estimated a global scale for coarse segmentation first and then used region merging to further refine the segmentation result. Other studies try to optimize segmentation at several distinct scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Yang et al., 2014)</ref>. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ming et al. (2015)</ref>, the attribute of bandwidth and object shape are also employed in unsupervised scale optimization.</p><p>In this study, a novel unsupervised cross-scale optimization method is proposed for HR image segmentation. In order to fully exploit the spatial information in GEOBIA analysis, a local spectral heterogeneity measure is developed to search the optimal objects from segmentation results with different scales. At first, we calculate the local spectral heterogeneity for every object at each scale. Then the local spectral heterogeneity curves of corresponding objects at different scales can be obtained. We select the optimal scale at the largest value of the curve. Finally, the selected objects are synthesized as the segmentation result. The main contributions of the proposed method are twofold: 1) A local spectral homogeneity measure is proposed to evaluate the intra-object and inter-object heterogeneity through spectral angle analysis. 2) Different from refining the segmentation results on a global optimal scale, this study aims to directly search the optimal objects at different scales. Then final segmentation results are fused by the selected optimal objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides promising segmentation results over different land cover types.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we   present the proposed optimal scale optimization method. Section 3 gives the study area and experimental results. The discussion and conclusion are described in Sections 4 and 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methodology</head><p>The objective of this paper is to develop an unsupervised multiscale segmentation optimization method by measuring the local spectral heterogeneity for HR images. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> depicts the framework of the proposed method. At first, a segmentation algorithm is applied to generate segmentation results of different scales. Then the objects are used to construct the region-adjacent graphs (RAG), which are built to specify the relationships between the neighboring objects. Second, a local spectral heterogeneity measure is proposed to evaluate every object at different scales. The optimal scale for the object is selected at the largest value of heterogeneity curve. Finally, the optimal objects selected from different scales are combined as segmentation result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Multiscale segmentation used</head><p>A region based multiscale image segmentation named MSEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tzotsos and Argialas, 2006</ref>) is used to generate the initial segmentation results for HR images. MSEG is developed from the multi-resolution segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Benz et al., 2004)</ref>. It initially generates an oversegmentation result and then merge the segmentation objects in every iteration to achieve the final segmentation result. The criterion for object merging is a homogeneity cost measure, defined as object heterogeneity, and computed based on spectral and shape features for each possible object to merge. The heterogeneity is then compared to a user defined size (scale parameter) to decide whether the merge is continued in next iteration. The general function is formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= + f h h • (1 )• , color shape (1)</formula><p>where h color and h shape represent the spectral and shape heterogeneity, respectively. The can be defined by user in the range [0, 1]. When the size of objects reaches the defined scale parameter, the merging process stops and segmentation result is obtained. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> depicts the process of generating multiscale segmentation results at different scales. As the algorithm merges small objects according to the preset scale parameter, the multiscale segmentation results can be generated at different scales with the objects merging. In addition, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, the locations of objects at different scales are nested. Otherwise the boundaries of objects at different scales would be conflicting when combining the objects in optimization process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Local spectral heterogeneity measure</head><p>Spectral angle is a commonly used distance metric to measure the difference between two spectral vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kruse et al., 1993)</ref>. The reflectance of individual pixel is represented as a B dimensional spectral vector, where B is the number of spectral bands. As each spectral vector has a direction, the spectral distance between two spectral vectors can be measured by spectral angle. Usually, the larger the spectral angle is, the more two spectral vectors are different.</p><p>In this study, the local spectral heterogeneity measure is a key step that calculates both inter-heterogeneity and intra-heterogeneity through spectral angle analysis. Let the mean spectral value of a segmented object be s (s B ). The mean value of adjacent objects of s are denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= = X x { } i i u 1 , where each x i (x i B</formula><p>) is a neighbor of segmentation object s and u is the number of adjacent objects. Then the inter-heterogeneity of object s can be formulated as</p></div>

The inter-heterogeneity measures the local spectral difference between central object s and all its adjacent objects X. The larger the s inter is, the more s is different from its adjacent objects.</p><p>The intra-heterogeneity of object is also taken into count for measuring spectral heterogeneity within an object. In a multiscale segmentation algorithm, the current object is always obtained by merging smaller objects in previous scales. For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, the object</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">+ t l (</formula><p>) 1 is merged by t 1 and t 2. Therefore, the object s can also be merged by objects from smaller scales, and then the intra-heterogeneity can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= r cos p q p p q q 1 , s intra p q T T T . 1 (4)</formula><p>where is the objects set found from nearest scale that merged the object s, and r is the number of objects in . p and q are the mean values of any two objects that belong to . If we cannot find the objects that merge s, then the s intra is set to 0. The intra-homogeneity is used to represent the separability of a segmentation object. For a segmentation object s that merged by smaller objects in previous iterations (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), if the spectral angle ( s intra ) between smaller objects is large, it indicates that the object s is highly separable, which also means that the previous merging operation may not be necessary.</p><p>Therefore, for an object s at any scale of segmentation result, we can design the local spectral heterogeneity measure that both integrates inter-heterogeneity and intra-heterogeneity. The local spectral heterogeneity E s t for s can be formulated as   (5</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where t is the scale parameter and</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">… t L [1, 2, , ]</formula><p>. L is the largest scale parameter for segmentation. All the s inter and s intra are normalized to [0, 1] before measuring spectral heterogeneity. Obviously, the higher E s t is, the more likely that object s is an optimal scale segment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Optimal object selection and combination</head><p>Since we have developed the local spectral measure for an object, the rest thing is to search the multiscale segmentation results and find the optimal object. To find the optimal object, a local heterogeneity curve is formed. Let z be a pixel of the HR image and m n ( , ) is the corresponding position. Then we can gather the objects that containing the pixel z with scale from 1 to L. For these objects that containing pixel z, an object evolution curve can be generated by calculating the local spectral heterogeneity. In the end, the corresponding optimal object is determined at the highest spectral heterogeneity E. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 and 4</ref> illustrate the optimal scale selection process of the pond object I1 and bare land object I2, respectively.</p><p>The object evolution curve can be generated at each position of an HR image. Therefore, the final segmentation result can be combined by all the selected objects. The combined scale map is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The details of this method are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. It is worth mentioning that there are no conflicts when we combine the selected objects. As the multiscale segmentation method merges small objects by iteration, the selected objects are all nested. Specially, for an object s i that is included in a larger object s j , if the heterogeneity E of s j achieves highest E in the large region but E of s i is higher than that of s j , then both s i and s j are preserved as selected optimal objects in this region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Quality assessment</head><p>In this study, besides visual analysis, a supervised segmentation evaluation method is used to assess the segmentation objects quality after scale optimization. The supervised segmentation evaluation method need a reference segmentation results as ground truth <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Su and Zhang, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Böck et al., 2017)</ref>. A number of segmentation performance indexes such as global score, Moran index, have been applied in segmentation evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Johnson and Xie, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhang et al., 2012)</ref>. Recently, a region-based precision and recall index <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Zhang et al., 2015a)</ref> is specially proposed for evaluating the segmentation performance of remotely sensed images. The precision and recall index are calculated based on the objects overlapping. The precision index reflects the quality of segments and the recall index indicates the manner in which the reference objects are described by segments.</p><p>Let the segmentation result be S with a objects … S S S , , , a 1 2</p><p>and the reference results be R with b objects</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">… R R R , , , b 1 2</formula><p>. The precision index is computed by matching the largest overlapping area of R imax to each segment S i , which can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">= = = precision S R S | | | | , i a i imax i a i 1 1 (6)</formula><p>where |•| represents the number of pixels in the object. Similarly, the recall index is calculated by matching the largest overlapping area of S imax to the reference object R i and is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">= = = recall R S R | | | | . i b i imax i b i 1 1 (7)</formula><p>Both indexes range from [0, 1]. The precision and recall are jointly used to evaluate the segmentation quality. Usually, an over-segmented result has a high precision value while the recall is small. In contrast, if the result is under-segmented, the recall would be large while the precision could be low. Therefore, to comprehensively assess the quality of segmentation, a combination strategy for precision and recall is proposed, called F-measure, which is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">= + F precision recall precision recall 2• • , (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where F is ranging from [0, 1]. Usually, a higher F value indicates a better segmentation quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Segmentation optimization methods for comparison</head><p>In this study, an unsupervised multiscale segmentation optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Johnson and Xie, 2011)</ref> is used in comparison with the proposed method. In Johnson &amp; Xie's method, a global scale is first identified by calculating the inter-segment and intra-segment heterogeneity with weighted variance and Moran's I. Then a refinement is conducted by further improving the under-segmented and over-segmented regions.</p><p>Apart from the cross-scale optimization mehtod, we also compare the proposed method with two global scale selection approaches. In order to evaluate the optimization quality of our proposed method, we first implemented a global spectral heterogeneity approach (E-global) by computing the average spectral heterogeneity of each scale, which can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">= E s E s (| |• ) | | mean t i O i s t i O i (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>where O is the number of objects over an entire image. By computing the E mean t from scale parameter 1 to L, a global optimal scale can be selected from the maximum value. Similar to other global scale selection methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Wang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Yang et al., 2015b)</ref>, the optimal single scale is selected according to the largest value of the</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">E t L , [1, 2, , ] mean t</formula><p>. Furthermore, we apply the F-measure index as a supervised scale optimization method (F-global) for comparison. We compute the F index of all segmentation results scaling from 1 to L, and thus the optimal scale can be selected from the largest F index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Experimental setup</head><p>The test area is located in Qingdao City, Shandong Province. Qingdao is a beautiful coastal city with various landscapes in East China. In this study, four test scenes (denoted as A, B, C and D), captured from QuickBird-2 with a resolution of 2.4 m on June 28, 2008, are used to evaluate the proposed optimization performance. All the scenes consist of four spectral bands (blue, green, red and near-infrared). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, the test images contain different land covers, such as sea, raft culture ponds, coastal aquaculture ponds, farm land and urban built-ups. The corresponding reference segmentation objects are edited manually for supervised evaluation and are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. Scene A has a size of × 600 600 pixels and Scene B has a size of × 700 700 pixels. Both Scene C and D have a size of × 500 500 pixels. The multiscale segmentation used in this study is MSEG algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tzotsos and Argialas, 2006)</ref>, which is implemented under C++ environment in a computer with an intel i7-6700 CPU (3.4Ghz) and 16G RAM. For the sake of consistency, the shape and compactness parameters required in the algorithm are fixed to 0.4 and 0.5, respectively. The segmentation algorithm is performed with the scale parameter increasing from 10 to 400 at an interval of 10. The proposed optimization method and competitive methods described in Section 2 are implemented in the same computer with Matlab 2018a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Optimal scales selection</head><p>As mentioned in Section 2, the optimal scale of each object is determined by the maximum value of local heterogeneity curve. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, we depict the local heterogeneity curves of different land covers, such as sea (Scene A), ponds (Scene A), aquaculture ponds (Scene B), vegetation (Scene C), farm land (Scene C) and bare land (Scene D). The corresponding positions (pixel coordinates) in test scenes are also listed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, we can clearly observe the evolution process of E s in different land covers. For example, for the sea and ponds objects in Scene A, the largest values fall at the scale of 400 and 350, respectively. The result is consistent with our intuition that the object scale of sea is larger than ponds. Similarly, the optimal scale for aquaculture ponds in Scene B falls at 110. We can also observe some rapid change of intraheterogeneity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> (e)(f)) with the scale increasing, indicating that the interior of object could have significantly different spectral vectors. This is possible that the object contains different land covers as the object may be under-segmented with the increase of scale. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> depicts the obtained scale maps over the test scenes. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, the blue color indicates a large optimal scale for the region while a red color indicates a small optimal scale. As the objects in Scene C and D mostly consist farm lands and buildings, the optimal scale for the objects are relatively small, which is consistent with the corresponding scale maps. In contrast, the optimal scales of Scene A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(a)</ref>) mainly fall at large scales because the scale for sea area is large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Segmentation evaluation</head><p>To evaluate the optimization performance, the Johnson &amp; Xie's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Johnson and Xie, 2011)</ref> and two global optimization approaches (E-global and F-global) are used in comparison with our proposed optimization method. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> reports the details about the optimization methods applied over test scenes. Five basic indexes are recorded in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>, including the number of objects, size of the largest object (pixels), size of smallest object (pixels), average size of objects and the standard deviation of size of objects. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>, we can observe that there is a big gap between the largest and smallest size of objects in the proposed method. It is understandable as the result of proposed method is a combination of multiscale segmentation results while the results of E-global and F-global only have the information of one single scale. Table 2 also reports the E mean , precision, recall and F index of proposed method and other three optimization methods. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>, we can observe that the proposed optimization method achieved highest value at F index and E mean over the four test scenes. The Johnson &amp; Xie's method also shows the potentials of cross-scale optimization method. Compared with the supervised method F-global, Johnson &amp; Xie's method achieves higher F over Scene B and D. However, the precision index of proposed method is usually lower while the recall is higher in comparison with other methods. In fact, according to the analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zhang et al. (2015a)</ref>, if an image is over-segmented, the precision index is higher and recall index is lower. Therefore, for some over-segmented results, such as Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10(b)(c</ref>) and 12(a)(b), the precision indexes are obviously higher than the proposed, and the recall is clearly lower the proposed method. One the other hand, some undersegmented regions can be observed in the results of proposed method, such as Figs. 9(d) and 11(d), so the lower precision is achieved and the corresponding F value is close to that of Johnson &amp; Xie's method and Fglobal method.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> depicts the F-measure at all scale parameters over four scenes. The F-measure of proposed method (red bar) is also compared with that of other segmentation results (blue bar). From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, we can find that the optimal single scale is larger than 120 for Scene A and B while the optimal scales for Scene C and D are obviously smaller than 120. As Scene A and B contain large area of sea water, it is reasonable that the optimal scale is larger than Scene C and D. The same phenomenon can also be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. In summary, the F-measure of proposed method is highest compared with all other multiscale segmentation results.</p><p>The segmentation results of proposed optimization method and three other approaches are shown in Figs. 9-12. Figs. 9 and 10 (Scene A and B) mainly show the segmentation results over the sea and aquaculture ponds area. In Scene A and B, the scales for sea and aquaculture ponds area are apparently different. The scale parameter for sea area is obviously larger than the scale of aquaculture ponds. From Figs. 9(a)(b) and 10(a), the under-segmented regions for pond objects can be observed obviously, while the over-segmented sea object can be found in Figs. 9(c) and 10(b)(c). Compared with other scale optimization methods, the optimal scale for sea and aquaculture ponds are both reserved in the proposed method. In Figs. 9(d) and 10(d), the object boundaries of aquaculture ponds and sea area are well preserved. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11 (Scene C</ref>) displays the segmentation results over farm land and bare land. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>, the farm lands are in regular shapes with different size of areas. We can observe that the objects of farm land are optimized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11 (d)</ref>, and the small objects on the bottom right of the image are well preserved. Scene D (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>) captured an urban area where buildings and playgrounds are distributed over the entire image. Obviously, the optimal scale for buildings is relatively small while the optimal scale for playgrounds is large. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>(b) shows a good segmentation in building while an over-segmented phenomenon is revealed in playgrounds. Similarly, an over-segmentation result in buildings is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12(a)</ref>. Fortunately, the different scale for buildings and playgrounds are optimized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12(d)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Computational cost</head><p>The computational burden is also analyzed over four test scenes. According to the previous analysis, we can find that the computational cost mainly consists of two parts: inter and intra heterogeneity. For the convenience of calculation, the spectral angle of adjacent objects calculated in inter-heterogeneity can be saved and used in intra-heterogeneity. Let the object number be N, and then the computational complexity of proposed method is O N ( ) 2 . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref> depicts the execution time of optimization methods over four HR image. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref>, we can observe that two single-scale optimization methods (E-global and Fglobal) spend least time over four scenes. Since both Johnson &amp; Xie's and proposed method need to calculate the inter and intra heterogeneity for each object, the two methods spend more execution time than two single-scale methods. In Scene B (700 × 700 by pixel), the execution time of Johnson &amp; Xie's method is up to 180 s. In Johnson &amp; Xie's method, a refinement need to conduct by further splitting or merging objects. In contrast, the selected objects in proposed method are all generated in segmentation procedure. Therefore, the execution time of proposed method is reduced when compared with Johnson &amp; Xie's method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>With the development of airborne and satellite sensor technologies, detailed spatial information in HR remote sensing images are available to researchers. The HR images raise a challenge of segmenting different objects, from water bodies to farm lands and buildings. The multiscale segmentation offers a possibility of segmenting objects with a preset scale, which can be determined by users to control the average size of objects. Due to the spatial variation of HR images, optimal scale selection has become an interesting topic and various algorithms have  been proposed to deal with it. Besides supervised based methods, unsupervised scale selection methods have drawn more attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Böck et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gonçalves et al., 2019)</ref>. Many studies consider that the spectral homogeneity and heterogeneity calculation can help decide the optimal scale of segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>This study proposed a local spectral heterogeneity measure to calculate inter and intra heterogeneity of objects at different scale parameters. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> shows the curves of local spectral heterogeneity, inter and intra heterogeneity. The curves report the evolution process of objects, where the optimal scale of objects can be determined by the maximum value. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 and 4</ref> depict the procedure of optimal objects selection, where the optimal scales for pond (I1) and bare land object (I2) are 350 and 200, respectively.</p><p>Many multiscale optimization methods focus on selecting a global scale to generate an overall goodness of segmentation objects. While the global scale gives an overall accurate segmentation results compared with other scales, it is still limited by the fact that the single scale would be applied to all land covers, such as sea, ponds, farm land and buildups, regardless how heterogeneous they are to each other. To overcome this limitation, two groups of solutions are proposed recently. The first solution attempts to guide the optimal scales with different land cover, which requires land covers classification before scale selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Yi et al., 2012)</ref>. Another solution tries to optimize the segmentation with more than one scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Xiao et al., 2018)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Johnson and Xie (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Su (2019)</ref>, an initial optimal scale is first selected and then further refinements are conducted to optimize the segmentation results.</p><p>The purpose of this proposed method is to directly find the optimal objects that could fit the land covers with a large scale gap. Through the proposed local spectral heterogeneity measure, these optimal objects are selected from segmentation results of different scales, and then combined as the final output. In the optimization results, both small and large objects can be preserved and delineated. For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, the large area of sea water and small size of ponds are described properly. We can also validate this observation by the difference between the size of largest and smallest object in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. Segmentation quality assessment measure demonstrates that the proposed method can select objects that make a good match with the reference objects. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>, the proposed method achieves highest F value compared with other optimization methods.</p><p>The local heterogeneity E is calculated based on the spectral angle analysis. With the scale increasing, the spectral differences between adjacent objects are also increasing significantly. Therefore, if the intraheterogeneity is low, it is possible that the maximum E value falls at a relatively higher scale, and this reason could limit the optimization performance of the proposed method. For instance, as displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>(d), an under-segmented region can be observed in the bottom of the image. That is because this region is surrounded by the road objects, which have a strong spectral difference with the vegetation-land regions. Thus the maximum E falls at a larger scale and an under-segmented phenomenon could be observed.</p><p>Although the segmentation algorithm used in this study is based on multi-resolution segmentation (MSEG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Benz et al. (2004)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tzotsos and Argialas, 2006)</ref>, the proposed method is implemented independently and can be applied in other multiscale segmentation algorithms, such as mean shift <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Comaniciu and Meer, 2002)</ref> and watershed segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Li et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Segmentation optimization is a vital and challenging task in GEOBIA applications. In this study, an unsupervised adaptive scale optimization method is proposed for multiscale HR image segmentation. To select the optimal segmentation objects, a local spectral heterogeneity measure is applied by calculating the spectral angle between inter and intra objects. Then the spectral heterogeneity curves of objects can be generated. Obviously, the optimal scale falls at the largest value of local spectral heterogeneity. The selected optimal objects are merged as the optimization result. The proposed method is evaluated over four test HR images with different land covers, such as sea, aquaculture ponds, farm land and built-ups. Optimization results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to adaptively select appropriate scales for different landscapes. Further experiments are conducted with the supervised segmentation quality assessment by computing the precision, recall and F-measure. The segmentation quality indexes also suggest that the proposed optimization provides satisfactory segmentation results compared with some other optimization methods. The proposed method can be applied in other multiscale segmentation algorithms. In the future, we will further improve the optimization performance in segmentation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
