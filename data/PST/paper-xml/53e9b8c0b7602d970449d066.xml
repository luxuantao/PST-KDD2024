<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robust Backstepping Control of Nonlinear Systems</head><p>Using Neural Networks Chiman Kwan, Senior Member, IEEE and F. L. Lewis, Fellow, IEEE Abstract-A controller is proposed for the robust backstepping control of a class of general nonlinear systems using neural networks (NNs). A new tuning scheme is proposed which can guarantee the boundedness of tracking error and weight updates. Compared with adaptive backstepping control schemes, we do not require the unknown parameters to be linear parametrizable. No regression matrices are needed, so no preliminary dynamical analysis is needed. One salient feature of our NN approach is that there is no need for the off-line learning phase. Three nonlinear systems, including a one-link robot, an induction motor, and a rigid-link flexible-joint robot, were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Index Terms-Adaptive, backstepping control, neural networks, nonlinear systems, robust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N RECENT adaptive and robust control literature, there has been a tremendous amount of activity on a special control scheme known as "backstepping" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. When used under some mild assumptions, many existing robust and adaptive control techniques can be extended to wide classes of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Recent papers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> have applied such techniques to various kinds of robotic control schemes with the inclusion of motor dynamics. A major problem with backstepping approaches is that certain functions must be "linear in the unknown parameters," and some very tedious analysis is needed to determine "regression matrices." For instance, even for two robots within the same class (same number of links, revolute joints) but with a different number of unknown parameters, minor changes in link lengths and masses, etc., one has to restart the whole tedious process of determining the regression matrix again. For a robot with six links, the job becomes even more difficult. Although symbolic computation may offer some help, one still has to manually manipulate and combine a lot of terms in the dynamical equations. In the case of backstepping adaptive control, the problem of determining and computing the regression matrices becomes even more acute. The complexity of the regression matrices and the number of unknown parameters increase with each step of the backstepping process. If one looks at a recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which talks about the application of backstepping technique to a simple DC motor control, one will Manuscript received April 1, 1999; revised <ref type="bibr">October 13, 2000</ref>.

Uncertainty on how to initialize the NN weights leads to the necessity for "preliminary off-line tuning" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Recently, many NN controllers have been proposed for various control applications that can provide closed-loop stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, a unified and general approach to backstepping control of nonlinear systems using NN is presented. We will use neural nets in each stage of the backstepping procedure to estimate certain nonlinear functions. This means that linearity-in-the-parameter assumption is not needed, and no regression matrices need be found. Thus, a major problem with backstepping is cured. Recent papers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> have initially applied this new idea to robots and motors. The objective of this paper is to further generalize our work to more general nonlinear systems with the goal of retaining the advantage of systematic design in backstepping control, while eliminating its tedious and lengthy procedure of finding the regression matrices.

Most importantly, we can guarantee the boundedness of tracking error and weight updates.</p><p>The paper is organized, as follows. In Section II, we will give a description of a class of nonlinear systems, system stability, and an example of standard backstepping design. Then, in Section III, we will introduce our NN backstepping controller. Closed-loop stability of NN will also be stated and proven in Section III. Several practical applications, including a one-link robot tracking, speed control of induction motors, and rigid-link flexible-joint robot trajectory control, will be given in Section IV. Finally, conclusions will be given in Section V.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Description</head><p>Robust control of nonlinear systems with uncertainties is of prime importance in many industrial applications. The model of many practical nonlinear systems can be expressed in a special state-space form <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref> where denote the states of the system, is the vector of control inputs, are nonlinear functions that contain both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties, and 's are known and invertible. Many systems can be expressed in the above form. For example, rigid robots and motors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, power converters <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and jet engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>The requirement that 's be invertible and known may be stringent. However, as will be illustrated in Section IV, one can eliminate this requirement by exploiting physical properties of a given nonlinear system.</p><p>Equation (2.1) is known as strict-feedback form <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. An Example of Backstepping Design</head><p>To illustrate the backstepping design procedure, let us consider a very simple nonlinear system in "strict-feedback" form. The system is a second-order nonlinear system described by (2.3a) (2.3b) where , scalar state variables; nonlinear functions with for all states; control input. The control objective is to make both to go to zero despite the presence of nonlinearities. One important observation of this system is that the linearized system is uncontrollable since the linearized equation for (2.3a) is of the form which is clearly uncontrollable. Hence, linear control techniques cannot be used for (2.3). On the contrary, backstepping design can be easily used to tackle this problem. The procedure consists of two steps.</p><p>Step Choosing the following controller (2.9)</p><p>will make the error to go to zero exponentially since, after substituting (2.9) into (2.8), the resulting equation becomes (2.10) Hence, will go to zero. Therefore, (2.5) will be valid and will go to zero. Here again, if (2.9) contains significant nonlinearities due to the functions and , we can also use a second neural network to approximate them. Details of extending the above ideas to more general nonlinear systems will be described in Section III.</p><p>Although the above backstepping procedure becomes more complicated when there exist parametric uncertainties in the systems, the basic idea remains the same. The complications are due to the following problems with the existing robust and adaptive procedures. First, "regression matrices" in each step of the backstepping design must be determined. For example, it is well known that, in the first step of designing adaptive controllers for robots, one has to determine the regression matrix which is a very tedious and time consuming task. This procedure gets even more involved as the number of backstepping increases. Second, one basic assumption in the current robust and adaptive backstepping methods is that the unknown system parameters must satisfy the so-called linearity-in-the-parameter as-sumption. This may not be true in many practical situations. For example, friction in robots is a complicated nonlinear process which is hard to model as a linear-in-the-parameter process. Another example will be that certain nonlinear functions may not be linear parametrizable, i.e., if</p><p>where is an unknown system uncertainty.</p><p>The goal of this paper is to present a unified approach of backstepping control to a class of nonlinear systems using neural networks. While retaining the merit of systematic design in backstepping control, we strive to alleviate the disadvantage of the tedious and lengthy process of determining and computing the regression matrices. The proposed controller is also re-usable in a sense that it is applicable to a class of, for instance, 6-link revolute joint robots.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. NN Basics</head><p>Let denote the real numbers, the real -vectors, the real matrices. Let be a compact simply connected set of . With map , define the functional space such that is continuous. We denote by any suitable vector norm. When it is required to be specific we denote the p-norm by . Define as the collection of NN weights. Then the net output is For suitable NN approximation properties, must satisfy some conditions.</p><p>Definition 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>: Let be a compact simply connected set of , and be integrable and bounded. Then is said to provide a basis for if 1) A constant function on can be expressed as (3.2) for finite .</p><p>2) The functional range of NN (3.2) is dense in for countable . It is emphasized that a basis is not difficult to find. The radial basis functions, for instance, provide a universal basis for all smooth nonlinear functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Barron <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has shown that the approximation error in (3.2) can never be made smaller than order where is order of the input space. Despite the lower bound achievable for , the tracking error will be proven to be bounded by a term as shown in <ref type="bibr">(3.23)</ref>, and the bound can be made small by increasing the gain of certain coefficients in the controller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Controller Structure</head><p>Referring to (2.1), our control objective is to make to follow a desired trajectory . The idea of backstepping is like this. First, we treat up to as fictitious control signals. In this stage, we use NN approach to design the fictitious controllers for to . Each is designed with the aim to reduce error between in the previous design stage. Second, we design an actual controller for to force the error between and as small as possible. In each step of the design process, NNs are used to approximate the nonlinear functions in the error dynamics. The overall control structure in shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>. Third, we perform an overall closed-loop stability and performance analysis of the on-line weight-tuning algorithm.</p><p>Step 1-Design Fictitious Controllers for , and : First of all, we design the fictitious controller for . Recalling that . The form of will be discussed in the next section. The usual adaptive backstepping approach is to assume that the unknown parameters in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> are linear parametrizable (LP) so that standard adaptive control can be used in this stage. As we will see in a moment, we will use a two-layer NN to approximate . The advantage is that no linearity-in-the-unknown-system-parameters assumption is needed and no regression matrix need be found.</p><p>The next step of backstepping design is to make the error between and as small as possible. Differentiating defined in (3.5) gives  In a similar fashion, we can design a fictitious controller for to make the error as small as possible, i.e., <ref type="bibr">(3.8)</ref> The dynamics of is then governed by (3.9) with , a design parameter and the estimate of . Conventional backstepping design assumes that are LP in unknown system parameters. Regression matrices are needed for all 's, . This is a very lengthy and tedious process which needs to be repeated for each new system. As we will see in Section III-C, our design procedure uses NNs to approximate the complicated nonlinear functions 's, . As a result, no regression matrices are needed and the controller is re-usable for different systems within the same class of nonlinear systems.</p><p>Step 2-Design of Actual Control : After the fictitious controller is designed, we need to find a way to realize them. Differentiating defined in (3.9) yields (3.10)</p><p>Choosing the controller of the form <ref type="bibr">(3.11)</ref> gives the following dynamics for error (3.12) with a design parameter and the estimate of . Similar to Step 1, the usual backstepping design procedure is to assume to be LP in unknown system parameters. However, in our controller design here, we will use a two-layer NN to approximate which means no LP or regression matrix requirement is needed. Also note that a term is added in (3.9) which is necessary to compensate the coupling effects introduced in (3.9).</p><p>Step 3-Closed-Loop Stability and Performance Analysis of NN Weight Tuning Algorithm: We will perform a detailed treatment of stability and performance analysis of a weight-tuning algorithm in Section III-C. Using Lyapunov stability theory we will carry out the stability analysis. We can show that all signals including tracking error, NN weights are all UUB. The overall control structure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>. It is important to note the simplicity of NN control when compared to adaptive backstepping control. In adaptive backstepping control, it is assumed that (3.5), (3.6), (3.9), (3.10) are linear in terms of known regression matrices. These regression matrices are very tedious to find and must be computed for each specific system. In fact, for some systems the LP assumption may not hold. For example, friction in robot is a complicated nonlinear process that is hard to model as a linear-in-the parameter process. Another simple example is that the nonlinear function may be in the form of which is clearly not LP. On the other hand, if bases in (3.13) are appropriately chosen, then NN equations (3.13) are valid. No regression matrices need be computed. It has been shown that the sigmoid can form a basis set <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, it was shown that the radial basis functions can form a basis. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, it was shown that a basis set is particularly easy to choose for CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) neural network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Bounding Assumptions, Error Dynamics, and Weight Tuning Algorithms</head><p>Assume that the nonlinear functions 's, in (3.5), (3.6), (3.9), and (3.12) can be represented by 2-layer neural nets for some constant "ideal" weights , i.e., Note that the term denotes the couplings between the error dynamics in <ref type="bibr">(3.16</ref>). The matrix is skew-symmetric. The closed-loop stability analysis and the weight tuning algorithms will be discussed in the next section.</p><p>Two standard assumptions, which are quite common in the neural networks literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>   Q.E.D. Remarks: a) A comparison with -modification <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> shows that the NN reconstruction error increases the bounds on and in a very interesting way. Note, however, that small tracking error bounds may be achieved by selecting large control gain . On the other hand, the NN weight error is fundamentally bounded by , the known bound on the ideal weights . The parameter offers a design tradeoff between the relative eventual magnitudes of and ; a smaller yields a smaller and a larger , and vice versa. b) Similar to -modification in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, no persistency of excitation (PE) is needed to establish the bounds on NN weight errors with the weight tuning algorithm (3.18). c) The contrast between the NN approximation property (3.2) and the adaptive control linear-in-the-parameter (LIP) assumption should be understood.</p><p>1) Both are linear in the tunable parameters, but the former is linear in the tunable NN weights, while the latter is linear in the unknown system parameters.</p><p>2) The former holds for all functions in , while the latter holds only for a specific function . 3) In the NN property, the same basis set suffices for all , while in the LIP assumption the regression matrix depends on and must be recomputed for different . That is, for instance, one must recompute for each different type of robot arm. Therefore, the two-layer NN controller is significantly more powerful than adaptive controllers; it provides a universal controller for robot arms within the same class. An example of "class" is the class of 2-link revolute robot arms with flexible joints.</p><p>d) It should be emphasized that our NN controller design procedure was motivated by a technique known as backstepping control <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In backstepping design procedures, preliminary dynamical analysis to determine regression matrices is crucial. The procedure becomes very tedious if we are dealing with a robot with multiple degrees of freedom. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, a backstepping design for RLFJ was given using sliding mode and adaptive control. The derivation of regression matrices, even for the one-link RLFJ simulation model, was very time-consuming and tedious. An immediate advantage of NN design is the no regression analysis is needed and the controller structure is reusable for different robots with different masses and lengths within the same class. e) Note that the problem of neural net weight initialization does not arise, since if 's are taken as zeroes the linear proportional control term stabilizes the system on an interim basis. Similar to other NN methods, our control scheme does not guarantee that 's will converge to the true 's. All we can say is that we can guarantee the boundedness of 's. f) In Section II, it was assumed that 's are known and invertible. Although this may sound restrictive, it should be emphasized that, in many practical applications, the above mentioned restriction can be alleviated by exploiting the physical properties of the system. Two practical applications will be described in Section IV: one for induction motor control and the other one for rigid-link flexible-joint robot control. Although the details of controller derivation and simulation results of these applications have been included in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we present some partial results here to illustrate that stability is still achievable even 's are unknown.</p><p>To deal with more general systems with unknown 's, we propose to use an approach described in <ref type="bibr">[31, p. 287</ref>]. This research is still underway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. APPLICATIONS</head><p>In this section, we present three applications. The first one is a one-link robot system with the inclusion of motor dynamics. As pointed out by Tarn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, the effects of motor dynamics will affect the performance of overall robot tracking. In this case, the 's are assumed to be known. The backstepping NN theory described in Section III can be directly applied. The second application is the robust control of an induction motor.</p><p>Here, the 's are actually unknown. However, by exploiting the physical properties of the motor dynamics, we circumvented the problem of unknown 's. In the third application, we applied the theory of backstepping NN control to rigid-link flexible-joint system. Properties of robot dynamics were used to alleviate the unknown problems. These applications, especially the last two, clearly demonstrate that the proposed backstepping control using NN has great potential in many diverse applications.</p></div>

NN Control of Induction Motors</head><p>The nomenclature of induction motors can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and details of controller derivation, proof, and simulations can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. .

Other nonlinear approaches include <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Marino et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> used adaptive input-output decoupling technique to tackle the control problem. Our work here uses the same field-oriented model and follows the same assumptions as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In the next section, we will make use of a special structure of the above model to perform our NN controller design.</p><p>2) Controller Structure, Error Dynamics, and Weight Update Rules: If we define and , then (4.4) is in strict-feedback form (2.1). We , as the ideal fictitious control signals for a subsystem consisting of (4.4a)-(4.4b). We design an NN controller for , . Finally, we use a second 2-layer NN to realize these fictitious signals. It should be noted that special physical properties of the motor dynamics were exploited so that the problem of unknown 's can be eliminated. Our control objective is to regulate the rotor speed and the magnetic flux magnitude. Denote and as the desired reference levels of and , respectively.</p><p>Step 1-Selection of Desired and to Control Subsystem Since in (4.5b) is unknown, this will cause some difficulties using the results of backstepping NN described in Section II. To alleviate this difficulty, we apply the following trick. Dividing both sides of (4.5b) by yields (</p><p>Now the coefficient of is unity and known.

Finally, is related to the actual control , through the following relation: Simulation Results: Using the data in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, we simulate the robust backstepping NN controller. The model we used was the original motor model before the state transformation from stator frame to rotator frame was applied. In other words, the field-oriented model was only used for controller design. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. We used four and ten neurons in the two NNs which approximate , respectively. The inputs to NN1 consist of , , , and . The inputs to NN2 consists , , , , , .

NN Backstepping Control of N-DOF Rigid-Link Flexible-Joint Robots 1) RLFJ Robot Model and Its Properties:</head><p>The model for an -link RLFJ robot is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> (4.17a) (4.17b) with denoting the link position, velocity, and acceleration vectors, respectively, the inertia matrix, the centripetal-Coriolis matrix, the gravity vector, representing the friction terms, the additive bounded disturbance, the motor shaft angle, velocity, acceleration, respectively, the difference between motor and joint angles, the positive definite constant diagonal matrix which characterizes the joint flexibility, a positive definite constant diagonal matrix denoting the motor inertia, representing the natural damping term, the control vector used to represent the motor torque, and representing an additive bounded torque disturbance.</p><p>If we define , , , , then (4.17) is indeed in the form of (2.1). However, due to the presence of uncertainties in the robot dynamics, we cannot directly apply the backstepping NN control theory to RLFJ expressed in "strictfeedback" form of (2.1). We need to exploit the following robot properties in order to effectively control the robot system.</p><p>The rigid dynamics (4.17a) has the following properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> where and are positive scalar bounding constants. Property 1 is very important in generating a positive definite function to prove stability of the closed-loop system. Property 2 will help in simplifying the controller. Many robust methods have incorporated Properties 1 and 2 in their controller designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. It should be emphasized here that, unlike standard robust and adaptive control schemes, we do not require linearity in the unknown robot parameter assumption.</p><p>2) Control Objective and Central Ideas of Our Controller Design: The control objective is to develop a link positiontracking controller for the RLFJ robot dynamics given by (4.17) based on inexact knowledge of manipulator dynamics. To accomplish this purpose, we first define the link position tracking error as <ref type="bibr">(4.22)</ref> where denotes the desired link position trajectory. It is assumed that and its derivatives up to the fourth order are bounded. In addition, we also define a filtered tracking error as Our controller design can be considered as consisting of three steps. The first step is to treat , the difference between motor shaft angle and joint angle , as a fictitious control signal to the error dynamics (4.24). We call this fictitious signal . Then (4.24) can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(4.26)</formula><p>where is an error signal which we will try to make as small as possible in the second step. The control objective of the first step is to design an NN controller for to make (and hence tracking error ) as small as possible. The structure of the controller will be described below. The objective of the second step is to design a second NN controller for another fictitious signal such that the error signal is as small as possible. To achieve this, we need to derive the dynamic equation for . Differentiating and using (4.17b) yields <ref type="bibr">(4.27)</ref> where and is a very complicated nonlinear function of , and . Now we need to derive a controller for u to make as small as possible. The error dynamics for is obtained by differentiating and multiplying the final expression by <ref type="bibr">(4.28)</ref> where is another very complicated nonlinear function , and . It should be noted that link acceleration is not needed in our controller. The reason is that, whenever shows up in (4.27) and (4.28), it will be replaced by . Finally, in the third step, we will perform an overall stability analysis using Lyapunov stability theory. Now (4.26)-(4.28) are in modified "strict-feedback" form (2.1). The problem of unknown 's is eliminated.</p><p>3) Control Design Procedure:</p><p>Step 1-Design of NN Controller for : To design an NN controller for the fictitious signal , we select the following structure: where , is a positive definite matrix, is a robustifying term to be defined shortly, and is defined in <ref type="bibr">(4.20)</ref>. Note that will depend on certain update algorithms to be described in the next section. Substituting (4.29) into (4.26) gives <ref type="bibr">(4.30)</ref> The form of is chosen to be <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dawson et al. 1992</ref>  Step 3-Overall Stability Analysis: The stability analysis will be proved by using Lyapunov stability theory. We can show that all signals including tracking error, NN weights are all UUB. The overall control structure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 3: Let the desired trajectory and its derivative up to the fourth order be bounded. Let , the control input be given by (4.29), <ref type="bibr">(4.31)</ref>  where is defined as diag and , are defined in (4.17), is the identity matrix. Then the proof follows a similar procedure as was described in Theorem 1. Details can also be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Hence it is omitted.</p><p>Q.E.D. Simulation Results: Consider a simple 2-link manipulator shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The model for this robot system can be described in the form of (4.17) with <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> The . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">8</ref> shows the results using the NN controller. Both tracking errors go to small values. The desired and actual trajectory almost overlap with each other. In addition, we do not even need the explicit expressions for those three highly complicated nonlinear functions , and in (4.26)-(4.28), respectively. This is a significant advantage since our controller can be applied to any type of RLFJ robots of different masses and lengths within the same class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented a general NN controller for the robust backstepping control of a class of nonlinear systems. The method does not require the system dynamics to be exactly known. Compared with adaptive backstepping control, linearity in unknown parameters is not needed. A major problem with backstepping is corrected in that no tedious computation of "regression matrices" is needed. Compared with other NN approaches, we do not require an off-line "training phase." All errors and weight are guaranteed to be bounded. The tracking error can be reduced to arbitrarily small values by choosing certain gains large enough.</p><p>Several practical systems, including an induction motor and a RLFJ robot, were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>reconstruction error vector.
