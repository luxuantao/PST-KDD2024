<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Representation of features of items and user feedback, and reasoning about their relationships are major problems in recommender systems. This is because item features and user feedback are subjective, imprecise and vague. The paper presents a fuzzy set theoretic method (FTM) for recommender systems that handles the non-stochastic uncertainty induced from subjectivity, vagueness and imprecision in the data, and the domain knowledge and the task under consideration. The research further advances the application of fuzzy modeling for content-based recommender systems initially presented by Ronald Yager. The paper defines a representation method, similarity measures and aggregation methods as well as empirically evaluates the methods' performance through simulation using a benchmark movie data. FTM consist of a representation method for items' features and user feedback using fuzzy sets, and a content-based algorithm based on various fuzzy set theoretic similarity measures (the fuzzy set extensions of the Jaccard index, cosine, proximity or correlation similarity measures), and aggregation methods for computing recommendation confidence scores (the maximum-minimum or Weighted-sum fuzzy set theoretic aggregation methods). Compared to the baseline crisp set based method (CSM) presented, the empirical evaluation of the FTM using the movie data and simulation shows an improvement in precision without loss of recall. Moreover, the paper provides a guideline for recommender systems designers that will help in choosing from a combination of one of the fuzzy set theoretic aggregation methods and similarity measures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Recommender systems are systems that provide users with an ordered list of items and information that help them to decide which items to consider or look at based on the individual user preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Recommendation systems use background data such as historical data consisting of ratings from users before the recommendation begins, input data such as features of items or users' ratings in order to initiate a recommendation, and models and algorithms to combine the former two and generate a recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>There have been many advances in recommender systems research. An extensive review of the different approaches used in recommender systems is presented in Burke <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Recently, Adomavicius and Tuzhilin <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have identified various areas of improvements for current recommender systems. They are: (i) better methods for representing user behavior and information about items; (ii) more advanced recommendation modeling methods; (iii) incorporation of contextual information into recommendation process; (iv) utilization of multi-criteria ratings; (v) development of less intrusive and more flexible recommendation methods; and (vi) development of recommender systems effectiveness measures. This paper attempts to address the improvement need stated in (i) and (ii) using the fuzzy modeling technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">The problem</head><p>A content-based recommendation requires data on the behavior of users and features of items. Its performance depends on the data and how this data is used, i.e. represented and inferred. Representation of and reasoning about the behavior of users and features of items raised a number of challenging issues. Features of items and users' behavior are subjective, vague and imprecise. These, in turn, induce uncertainty on representation of and reasoning about the items' features, users' behavior, and their relationship. Such uncertainty is non-stochastic or non-random and is induced from subjectivity, vagueness and imprecision in the data, the domain knowledge and the task under consideration <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In relation to items, the uncertainty is associated to the extent (e.g. low to high) in which the items have some features. For instance, to what extent does a movie have drama content or is it highly drama related? In relation to the users' behavior such as interest, the uncertainty is associated to methods employed to measure and represent users' interest as precisely as possible. In relation to the recommendation task, uncertainty is associated to types of relationship that exist between first, user behavior and item features, second, among users in terms of their behavior, and third, among items in terms of their features. Such non-stochastic uncertainty is not studied well and modeled in previous recommender systems research such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">The proposed method</head><p>In fuzzy modeling membership functions in fuzzy set theory are deliberately designed to treat the vagueness and imprecision in the context of the application <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This capability is used to provide the framework to address the representation and inference challenges associated to non-stochastic uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> in recommender systems.</p><p>The study is motivated by the "reclusive methods" proposed by Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> discusses the potential of fuzzy modeling and also presents a methodology consisting of collection of justifications and heuristic rules for the recommendations based on fuzzy set and fuzzy logic. He assumes the availability of a representation scheme for each object that allows the development of an appropriate tool to calculate the similarity relationship over the set of objects. He also assumes the availability of similarity index between two objects. However, he did not conduct an empirical study to support or refute the effectiveness of using fuzzy modeling. This research is an attempt to further develop and empirically evaluate fuzzy set theoretic method (FTM) for content-based recommender systems using the problem of movie recommendation as its domain. Particularly, the proposed approach uses features of items as background data and user's feedback such as ratings of items as input.</p><p>The study defines a representational method, aggregation methods, and similarity measures for content-based recommender systems. It also develops algorithms and carries out an empirical assessment of the effect of the fuzzy set theoretic method (FTM) on the performance of a movie recommender system by comparing its results to the results of the baseline crisp set based method (CSM). An empirical assessment of the effect of the various inference mechanisms-combinations of the aggregation methods and similarity measures is also performed. The study also considers analyzing the effect of the model size (also called training size-number of rated items initially needed from a user), and recommendation size (number of items recommended at one time to a user) on the performance of a movie recommender system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Results, conclusion and contributions</head><p>Using actual data on movies, the results of the simulation study provide empirical evidence that supports the effectiveness of FTM. The results show a modest increase in precision without loss of recall. It also requires a modest training size and recommendation size. Moreover, the results of analysis of variance show that there are significant differences among the different alternative combination of fuzzy set theoretic similarity measures and aggregation methods in their recommendation accuracy. The paper has the following main contributions:</p><p>1. Compared to using crisp set theory, the paper shows using fuzzy set theory slightly improves precision without loss of recall for content-based movies recommendation application. 2. The paper provides a representation framework for features of items and users feedback using fuzzy sets as well as new algorithms for content-based item recommender systems. 3. The paper presents a practical and detailed description of how to apply fuzzy set theory in a new domain as well as how to conduct extensive experimental study to validate the theory. 4. The paper provides a guideline for recommender systems designers that will help them to choose a combination of one of the fuzzy set theoretic aggregation methods and the fuzzy set theoretic similarity measures.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of related literature. Section 3 presents the representation method, inference methods, similarity measures and algorithms. Section 4 describes the dataset, evaluation settings, and evaluation metrics. Section 5 presents the results of the evaluation followed by the discussion in Section 6. Finally, our conclusions and future research directions are presented in Section 7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Recommender systems</head><p>There are various classifications of recommendation methods. Based on the sources of data and how these data are used for recommendation, Burke <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> has classified recommendation methods into: collaborative, content-based, demographic, utility-based, and knowledge-based. There are also various variants of hybrid methods that combine these methods. These hybrid methods are discussed in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Moreover, a recent survey of state-of-the-art recommender systems along with suggestions for improvements is found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The two most widely used methods of recommendation are content-based and collaborative filtering (CF). In collaborative filtering, an item is recommended to a user based on other similar users' actions like interests, preferences and ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Because of the availability of ratings data, CF is the most fully explored and several numbers of studies are reported. Deshpande and Karypis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> developed item-based Top-N recommendation algorithms that are collaborative type and faster than traditional user-user collaborative algorithms with comparable recommendation hit-rate. Moreover, results of evaluation of these CF algorithms for recommender systems using the MovieLens dataset are reported in terms of precision and F1-measure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>In content-based recommendation, an item is recommended to a user mainly based on the characteristics of the item and the user's past actions like purchases, queries, and ratings. Moreover, in content-based recommendation, standard machine learning techniques such as clustering, Bayesian networks and induction learning are applied in forming attribute-based models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Alspector et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> used a set of seven movie features-category, MAAP rating, academy award, origin, length, director and Maltin rating, in addition to the rating. They showed that the pure CF method produces significantly better results (in terms of correlation measure between predicted and actual rating) than the ones obtained with the content-based method.</p><p>Basu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> applied inductive learning approaches that use Ripper for recommendation of movies. They showed that content-based approaches result in loss of precision with modest increase in recall; collaborative approaches improve precision with modest loss of recall; and hybrid approaches increase both precision and recall. Weng and George <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> have also reported similar result for precision. These studies indicated that the mere introduction of movie features alone does not improve precision. The present study attempts to show that a proper introduction of movie features does improve precision without loss of recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Fuzzy modeling</head><p>Fuzzy set theory offers a rich spectrum of methods for the management of non-stochastic uncertainty. It is well suited to handle imprecise information, the un-sharpness of classes of objects or situations, and the gradualness of preference profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>A fuzzy set A in X is characterized by its membership function, which is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A (x) : x ∈ X → [0, 1],</formula><p>where X is a domain space. Alternatively, set A can be characterized by a set of pairs:A = {(x, A (x)), x ∈ X}. According to the context in which X is used and the concept presented, the fuzzy membership function, A (x), can have different interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. As a degree of similarity, it represents the proximity between different pieces of information. For example, the membership of movie x in the fuzzy set of "drama movies" can be estimated by the degree of similarity. As a degree of preference, it represents the intensity of preference in favor of x, or the feasibility of selecting x as a value of X. For instance, a movie with rating of four out of five indicates the degree of a user's satisfaction or liking with x based on certain criteria, like movie attributes such as content-intensity of action, drama, and humor. These two interpretations are used in this research.</p><p>The relationship between fuzzy set theory and probability has been the most controversial in uncertainty modeling mainly due to the possible confusion and differences between membership function and probability measure. It is clear now that they are two complementary theories. Dubois and Prade <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> presented some of the mathematical difference between possibility and the quantitative, explicit Kolmogoroff's probability. Zimmerman <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> also indicated that comparing fuzzy set theory with probability theory is not easy because of the various aspects in which the comparison can be made, because of the many different ways of mathematically defining and operating fuzzy sets, and because of the various kinds of fuzziness that can be modeled. One difference between fuzziness and probability is probability theory measures the chance that a proposition is correct where as fuzzy set theory measures degree of correctness to which a proposition is correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Possibility theory, introduced in 1978 by Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, made it possible to deal with uncertainties of imprecise knowledge. It allows the quantification of uncertainty as a pair of numbers, possibility and necessity. In a proposition such as 'X is A', where X is a variable and A is a fuzzy set, if all we know about the value of X is that X is A, then this corresponds to a situation where information is incomplete. Then one can associate a possibility distribution to X (denoted by x ) where the values of X are ordered according to their degree of plausibility or possibility. The possibility distribution function x (u) is defined to be numerically equal to the membership function A (u) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. That is, a membership function has a possiblistic interpretation, which assumes the presence.</p><p>Forecasting, bidding and auctions, negotiation, targeting, recommender systems and profiling are pointed out as application areas that can benefit from soft computing paradigm and data mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Research efforts that address non-stochastic uncertainty using fuzzy modeling for recommendation systems have emerged recently, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. These works use fuzzy sets to define linguistic categorizations of products in an e-commerce, and form overlapping clusters using fuzzy clustering.</p><p>FTM is case-based as " "similar" cases are recalled, and based on them each possible decision is evaluated." <ref type="bibr">[17, p. 609</ref>]. Dubois et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> presented a fuzzy-set based counterpart to the case-based decision. As a case-based decision theory (CBDT) driven approach, FTM does have the following features <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: each recommendation decision is evaluated over a different set of cases; to make recommendation decision there is no need to consider all possible states and the corresponding outcomes; the system is not assumed to know anything about the outside world, apart from past cases; and the system learns by including new cases and updated its similarity judgment and recommendation decisions continuously.</p><p>FTM differs from the previous recommendation systems in its representation and inference methods. Furthermore, this study has done extensive empirical evaluation to identify the significance of the use of fuzzy representation and inference methods and other factors on the performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The representation and inference methods</head><p>The proposed fuzzy set theoretic content-based approach is based on a user's previous feedback, and features of the new items and features of the set of items for which the user has provided feedback. The rationale of this method is that users are more likely to have interest in items, like movies, that are similar to the items they have experienced and liked. The representation method, inference engine consisting of aggregation methods and similarity measures, and the algorithms are presented in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Item representation using fuzzy set</head><p>A membership function in fuzzy set theory is deliberately designed to handle the vagueness and imprecision in the context of the application <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The type of function that is suitable depends on the application context, and in certain cases the meaning captured by fuzzy sets is not too sensitive to the variations in the shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In practice, triangular, trapezoid, Gaussian, S-function, and exponential-like functions are the most commonly used membership functions. Moreover, in practice, a suitable membership function's shape is assumed a priori and its parameters are determined by domain experts or using machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The former approach, i.e. domain analysis and expertise, is used in this research.</p><p>For an item described with multiple attributes, more than one attribute can be used for recommendation. Some attributes can also be multi-valued involving overlapping or non-mutually exclusive possible values. One should note that, movies are multi-genres and multi-actors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The values of multi-valued attributes in an item can be represented more accurately within a fuzzy set framework than within a crisp set framework. Items of this type are considered in this research. Moreover, the representation scheme presented for a movie can be generalized and applied to any item with similar characteristics to a movie. A few examples are music, TV shows, restaurants and books.</p><p>Let an item I j (j = 1, . . . , M) be defined in the space of an attribute X = {x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , . . . , x L }, then I j can take multiple values such as x 1 , x 2 , . . . , and x L . The membership function of item I j to value x k (k = 1, . . . , L), denoted by</p><p>x k (I j ), needs to be determined. Hence, a vector X j = {(x k , x k (I j )), k = 1, . . . , L} is formed for I j , where x k (I j ) can be interpreted as the degree of similarity of I j to a hypothetical (or prototype) pure x k type of the item; or as the degree of presence of value x k in item I j .</p><p>In a movie marketing application, most movies are selected for pleasure and expenditure of time. Users choose movies they like and enjoy. Furthermore, users use subjective features of movies such as "funny", "romantic", and "scary" (all are kinds of movie genres) to select movies more than objective features such as the director, theatre location and price, which are useful but are less important <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We use the movie as an item and movie genre as the attribute to make the method operational and develop the heuristic.</p><p>Analysis of descriptions of main film genres shows that genre g 1 of movies (e.g. action) and genre g 2 of movies (e.g. adventure) are overlapping in terms of their subject matter and other movie attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Based on the result of the findings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, movies highly liked by users can be grouped into similar categories by subjective features of movies such as genre and MPAA rating. This assertion is also verified in Section 5 using the movie dataset.</p><p>In determining the genre content of a movie, we use a heuristic based on the genres' rank orders, available in IMdb.com and provided by the movie producers, instead of the crisp representation-the genre is presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> or absence (0) data value. An ideal technique is automatic content analysis of a movie for automatic identification of its genres. The automatic content analysis of a movie for automatic identification of its genres will provide the extent or degree of presence or amount of a genre in a movie. For example, amount of dramatic feature in a movie A, amount of action features in a movie A, etc. However, automatic content analysis technologies are not yet well developed and available. For example, a preliminary research on the automatic identification of movie genres by exploiting audio-visual cues in a movie is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>In the absence of this technique, we conduct the domain analysis based on the literature in movies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> and the available data provided by movies producers in the movie database. Given the definition of a movie in the space of genre (G), a movie can have one major genre denoted by x 1 and one or more minor genres x 2 , x 3 , and so on, in the decreasing order of their degrees of presence in a movie. The degree of membership of movie</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I j (j = 1, . . . , M) to genre x k (k = 1, . . . , N) is denoted by x k (I j ). Hence, for I j , a vector G j = {(x k , x k (I j )), k = 1, . .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. , N} can be formed. The following steps are taken in the development of the heuristic for the determination of the membership function x k (I j ).</head><p>Step 1: Sort x k in descending order of their degree of presence in I j . In IMDB (www.imdb.com<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> ) the genres of movie I j are presented in the order of their significance. For example, movie 'King Kong (2005)' has Action as a major genre, and Adventure as the first minor, Drama as the second minor, Fantasy as the third minor, and Thriller as the fourth minor genres.</p><p>Step 2: Assign higher degrees of membership value to more important genres of a movie. For instance, If I j has only one genre, then x k (I j ) = 1 and x k (I j ) = 0 for all k = 2 to N . If I j has two genres, then x k (I j ) = 0.9, x k (I j ) = 0.4 and x k (I j ) = 0 for all k = 3 to N . If I j has three genres, then x k (I j ) = 0.7 and x k (I j ) = 0.5, x k (I j ) = 0.2 and x k (I j ) = 0 for all k = 4 to N; and so on. Based on the heuristics illustrated above, the possibility for item I j to take different values of X varies and the membership function should meet the following four criteria: (1) assigning higher degree of membership to major values than minor values; (2) assigning 0 to values that are not associated with the item; (3) degrees of membership should be normalized to the range of [0, 1]; and (4) the same value of X at similar rank positions between different items should have varying degrees of membership values if the number of values of X associated with the items are different. We represent this type of heuristic with a Gaussian-like membership function, as shown in (1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x k (I j ) = r k /2 √ * |L j |(r k -1) , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where N = |L j | is the number of values of X associated with I j and r k (1 r k |L j |) is the rank position of value x k , and &gt; 1 is a parameter used as a threshold to control the difference between consecutive values of X in I j . Moreover, is the only parameter that needs to be determined. For example, using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>) with set to 1.2 (after various experimental trials), the movie 'King Kong (2005)' is represented in terms of genres: for |L j | = 5 and x j = {(Action, 1), (Adventure, 0.366), (Drama, 0.272), (Fantasy, 0.211), (Thriller, 0.168)}. Furthermore, for User 7, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the representation of some of the rated movies.</p><p>Ross et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> stated that a membership function (MF) should match "the intuitively plausible semantic description of imprecise properties of the objects in X." The reason we make the first important genre completely satisfied is movies are advertised exclusively as having a specific genre such as drama and comedy; as well users have similar perception to movies. The soundness of the representation and inference method are further investigated in Section 5 using the movie dataset.</p><p>The reciprocal function defined as 1/k for k = 1 to N is also investigated. The problem with the reciprocal function is it does not consider the total number of different genres that exist in movies leading to the same degree of membership value for the same genre at same rank position with different number of genres. A uniform distribution membership of genres in a movie, assuming a movie with multiple genres has equal degree of genre presence for all occurring genres represented by 1 or 0, is the baseline crisp set representation.</p><p>The heuristic that leads to the membership function in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>) is developed based on the analysis of the movie dataset, literature on movies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and preliminary experimental trials conducted on . This heuristic, for instance, assumes that two genres will not have equal degree of presence in a movie. That is, two or more genres cannot exist in "equal degree of presence" or "in equal amount" in a movie. For example, let us say a movie X has drama and comedy. The movie cannot have dramatic and comedy nature with exact equal 'amount', i.e. with exact degree of membership 0.5 each. This is also true in the movies database used in this research. This assumption is logical because a movie cannot have exactly the same "content" of two or more genres. If the amount of content is close then needs to be tuned.</p><p>Moreover, in future research, studying various membership functions is needed in order to get an optimal fuzzy set based recommender system. The basis of our study is, provided that a membership function that satisfies the four criteria identified above. A is used, the recommendations by FTM will be better than crisp-set based approach. The representation scheme can be extended to recommender systems based on a combination of multiple attributes. For example, one can use movie actresses/actors as the second attribute. The actors in a movie can be represented in a vector A = {a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a k } for K actors. The role or importance of an actor or actress a k in a movie m i can be represented by degree of membership associated with the fuzzy variable 'degree of role or importance'. That is, A j = {(a k , a k (I j )), for k = 1 to K}, where a k (I j ) can be determined heuristically or using machine learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">User feedback representation using fuzzy set</head><p>User rating is the most widely used feedback in recommender systems. It is a proxy variable used for measuring user degrees of interest in an item. User ratings are represented and interpreted as binary values-those liked or disliked. In five-scale ratings, those above 3 are considered as liked. However, user rating is intrinsically imprecise as a user may give different ratings to the same item at different times and situations due to the difficulty to make a distinction between rating 4 and 5, and 1 and 2. Moreover, the same rating, say 4 on a scale of 5, given by two users does not necessarily imply equal degrees of interest in an item.</p><p>For pessimistic users, a rating of 4 may mean strongly liked but for optimistic raters it may mean somewhat liked. Is the difference between ratings 3 and 4 the same as the difference between 4 and 5? These all contribute to fuzziness that arises from the human thinking processes instead of randomness associated with the ratings. Therefore, user interest based on user rating is treated as a fuzzy variable and its uncertainty is represented using a possibility distribution function. Let the fuzzy variable degrees of interest in an item (DI) consisting of strongly liked (SL), liked (L), indifferent (I ), disliked (D), and strongly disliked (SD) fuzzy values, and associated with user rating (R) expressed in continuum from minimum value (Min) to maximum value (Max). Then, the proposition 'a user has strongly liked an item I' has the possibility distribution function R (I ) = SL (R = r), for r between Min and Max.</p><p>Under this interpretation or semantic of the fuzzy variable DI, the user rating is represented and inferred using a possibility distribution function by treating the rating as a fuzzy number <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. For instance a rating 4 on 5 scale which refers to strongly liked is represented in terms of its possibility distribution values = { SL (R = 4)/5, L (R = 4)/4, . . . , SD (R = 4)/1}. For instance, for User 7 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the possibility distribution of User 7's rating of High on movie 56 can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">{ SL (R = 4) = 0.50, L (R = 4) = 1, I (R = 4) = 0.50, D (R = 4) = 0.</formula><p>25, SD (R = 4) = 0.0}; and possibility distribution of User 7's rating of Very High on movie 79 can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{ SL (R = 5) = 1, L (R = 5) = 0.55, I (R = 5) = 0.20, D (R = 5) = 0.0, SD (R = 5) = 0.0}.</formula><p>Without losing generality, a half triangular fuzzy number, which is the simplest model of uncertain quantity, is used to represent the degree of positive experience a user has in relation to an item. The half triangular fuzzy number membership function, for user rating r on I i ∈ [Min, Max] and for a fuzzy set A on DI, is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A (I i ) = (r -Min)/(Max -Min).</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">)<label>2</label></formula><p>As a result, a set of items liked by a user, denoted by E, is defined as: {I i : A (I i ) &gt; 0.5, i.e., I i : r &gt; (Min +Max)/2}.</p></div>

This in turns highly depends on the appropriateness and reliability of the methods of representation. The set-theoretic, proximity-based and logic-based are the three classes of measures of similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In fuzzy set and possibility framework, similarity of users or items is computed based on the membership functions of the fuzzy sets associated to the users or item features. Based on the work of Cross and Sudkamp <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, those similarity measures that are relevant for item recommendation application are adapted.</p><p>For items I j and I k that are defined as {(x i , x i (I j )), i = 1, . . . , N} and {(x i , x i (I k )), i = 1, . . . , N}, a similarity measure between I j and I k is denoted by S(I k , I j ), and the different similarity measures are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">S 1 (I k , I j ) = i min( x i (I k ), x i (I j )) i max( x i (I k ), x i (I j )) , (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">S 2 (I k , I j ) = i x i (I k ) * x i (I j ) (( i ( x i (I k )) 2 )) (( i ( x i (I j ) 2 )) , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">S 3 (I k , I j ) = 1 - ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ d 2 (I k , I j ) Max i { x i (I k ), x i (I j )} ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ , (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">S 4 (I k , I j ) = 1 - 2 Z I k + Z I j d 2 (I k , I j ) 2 , (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where 2 for a = k or j.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">d 2 (I k , I j ) = i ( x i (I k ) -x i (I j )) 2 and Z I a = i (2 * x i (I a ) -1)</formula><p>These fuzzy set based similarity measures are: fuzzy set theoretic in (3), cosine in (4), proximity (Minkowski's distance based) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">5</ref>), and correlation-like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. The similarity measure for the baseline method, where item feature (e.g. genre) and user feedback (e.g. rating) are represented as crisp sets is called the crisp set based similarity measure (CSM) and defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">S 5 (I k , I j ) = i min( x i (I k ), x i (I j )) i max( x i (I k ), x i (I j )) .

Eqs.

Using crisp set theoretic <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, crisp cosine (similar to (4) except that 1 or 0 are used instead of membership degree) and crisp distance measures (similar to (5) except that 1 or 0 are used instead of membership degree) the similarity between I 1 and I 2 are 0.40, 0.58, and 0.73, respectively. Finally, using the corresponding fuzzy set theoretic similarity measures (3), (4), and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">5</ref>) the similarity coefficients are 0.24, 0.25, and 0.55. The difference in the representation leads to the variation in similarity measures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Aggregation methods</head><p>The recommendation decision-making methods used in FTM are case-based decision. There are different recommendation score aggregation methods for computing and combining the various contributions to recommendation confidence scores in order to make recommendation decision within the framework of fuzzy and possibility theory. The two alternatives that consider both user feedback and similarity between previously liked items and a new item are weighted-sum and max-minimum. They are defined as follows.</p><p>Weighted-sum: For each targeted item I j , calculate the weighted sum (weighted-sum) recommendation confidence score as</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">R 1 (I j ) = k E (I k )S(I k , I j ), (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>where E is a set of positively experienced (liked) items by users, and E (I k ) is the membership of the item I k to the set E.

A normalized evaluation score for each I j 's recommendation confidence score is obtained using NR 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">(I j ) = R 1 (I j )/ max k [R 1 (I k )]</formula><p>Maximum-minimum: For each targeted item I j , calculate the maximum-minimum (max-min) recommendation confidence score as where E is a set of positively experienced (liked) items by users, and E (I k ) is the membership of the item I k to the set E. Furthermore, S(I k , I j ) is the similarity between I j and I k computed using one of the similarity measures defined in Eqs.

A normalized evaluation score is obtained by dividing each I j 's recommendation confidence score by the maximum of recommendation confidence scores.</p><p>R 1 takes into account all participating elements hence it has a compensatory effects between highly liked and just liked items in E as well as most similar and least similar items. R 2 is high as soon as there is at least one good rated item similar to the new item. R 2 is similar to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) in Calmès et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">4</ref>) in Dubois et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. There are several variants of aggregator operators, and two common operators are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">R 3 (I j ) = min k {max((1 -S(I j , I k ), E (I k ))}, R 4 (I j ) = max k (S(I j , I k ), E (I k )) .</formula><p>R 3 is defined in Dubois et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and is high when all items are similar to the new one. Hence, R 2 is considered to be the optimistic counterpart to R 3 . R 4 is just a variant of R 2 where product operator is used instead of the min for the 'and' operator, and it is high in the same circumstances as R 2 . In future works, the aggregation operators R 3 , R 4 and other suitable operators will be identified and considered.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Dataset</head><p>The benchmark dataset from MovieLens at the University of Minnesota, 2 which has been widely used in recommendation research, is used in this study. The dataset includes movie attributes, user ratings, and user demographic information. The dataset consists of 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies; and each user has rated at least 20 and at most 737 movies. In the dataset, movies are described with: movie id, movie title, release date, video release date, IMDb URL, and 20 genres including action, adventure, animation, children's, comedy, crime, documentary, drama, fantasy, film-noir, horror, musical, mystery, romance, sci-fi, thriller, war, western, family, and unknown.</p><p>Genres in the MovieLens dataset are represented with binary values, which do not reflect the true content of movies in the genre space. Therefore, we use the proposed representation scheme by incorporating information about movie genres retrieved from the Internet Movie Database (imdb.com), which is a large database consisting of comprehensive information about past, present and upcoming movies. In IMDb, the producers of a movie present genres in the movie in order of their degree of presence, and this information is used in Eq. (1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Evaluation metrics</head><p>Accuracy is a commonly used metric for a recommender system based on user tasks or goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The accuracy metrics includes predictive and recommendation accuracy measures. Predictive accuracy measures such as mean absolute error, mean squared error and percentage of correct predictions are found to be less appropriate when the user task is to find 'good' items and when the granularity of true value is small because predicting a 4 as 5 or a 3 as 2 makes no difference to the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Instead, the recommendation accuracy metrics of precision, recall and F1-measure are more appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The precision and recall are computed using movies for which ratings are provided and held for testing; and movies with ratings 4 and 5 are considered as movies liked by users. This approach of measuring performance is widely used in recommender systems research, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Precision measures the ratio of correct recommendations being made.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Following the assessment of the soundness of FSM, first the mean performance of the proposed method is presented along with the results of comparative analysis between a fuzzy set theoretic method (FTM) that includes fuzzy set, cosine, proximity-based, and correlation-like, and the baseline crisp set similarity-based method (CSM). Second, the results from the analysis of the effect of the different factors-similarity measure, aggregation method, training size, and recommendation size-on the recommendation accuracy are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">The soundness of the FTM</head><p>The FTM uses recently liked movies by the user. It depends on the degree of similarity between the targeted movie, and those rated movies as well as the aggregation method. It assumes users prefer movies with specific genres. For a user the rated movies are grouped into three groups: group 1 consisting of movies with rating 1 and 2 (labeled as disliked), group 2 consisting of movies with rating 4 and 5 (labeled as liked), and group 3 consisting of movies with rating 3 (labeled as indifferent). For instance, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> visually presents the distribution of the genres by the three preference categories for user 7 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). It roughly shows that user 7 likes drama, romance and adventure; dislikes thriller; and is indifferent to comedy, action and crime.</p><p>Based on the representation of movie genres using (1), we check the soundness of the representation by verifying the following assertion using statistical methods: users have preference to movies of specific genres (e.g. Drama, Comedy and Family) with some degree of memberships over others (e.g. Action, Horror and Adventure).</p><p>First, one-way ANOVA shows that there are significant differences in the mean degree of membership of movies for the different genres among those movies which are liked, disliked, and indifferent by users with the exception of Animation, Documentary, Musical and Science Fiction. Had it been a random occurrence of genres with respect of users' ratings, the results would have been non-significant for all genres. The reason for non-significant differences in the four genres is due to their rare occurrence in movies data. Second, since recommendation decisions are made using recommendation scores, another way of verifying the soundness of the representation and inference procedure is to test correlation between user ratings and recommendation confidence scores. Significant bi-variant relationships are found which is in agreement with the result reported in the movie literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Therefore, the results support the assertion and hence validate the soundness of the representation and inference methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Overall performance</head><p>The means of recommendation accuracy by aggregation method and similarity measure are presented in Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>. The highest mean precision, recall and F1-measure are 55%, 38%, and 38% for FTM compared to the 49%, 39%, and 38% for the baseline CSM (crisp set based) method, respectively. Overall, FTM improves the precision with comparable recall, and the 6% increase is statistically significant at 5%.  Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the precision for different recall levels. Overall, unsteady decline in precision is observed as recall increases, and the decline is consistent across all similarity measures. For fixed recall, all the mean precisions of FTM are greater than that of the baseline CSM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Effect of aggregation method</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> shows the effect of aggregation strategy on performance. The precision is not affected by the aggregation method (not significant at 5%), but the max-min aggregation method yields greater recall than the weighted-sum method (significant at 5%). Therefore, depending on a task, recommender systems designers can choose one of the two aggregation methods. For instance, max-min aggregation strategy would be a choice for the task of finding all "good" items because it results in higher recall across all crisp-based and fuzzy-based similarity measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Comparison between fuzzy-theoretic method and the baseline crisp set-theoretic method</head><p>Pair-wise multiple comparisons test using Bonferroni<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> test, using the results in Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>, is conducted between mean performance of crisp set theoretic approach (CSM) and the varieties of fuzzy set theoretic approaches (FTM). The results are summarized as follows.</p><p>With weighted-sum aggregation method, all the mean precisions and F1-measures of the FTM (with the exception of the case using proximity similarity measure where its mean F1-measure is not significantly different) are greater than that of the CSM. Moreover, there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in their mean recall except in the case of the proximity-based similarity where its mean recall is lower for FTM.</p><p>With maximum-minimum aggregation method (at 5% level of significance), all the mean precisions of the FTM are greater than that of the CSM. Furthermore, all the mean recalls of the FTM are less than that of the CSM. Finally, except cosine similarity where there is no significant difference, all the mean F1-measures of the FTM are less than that of the CSM. The result on recall is unexpected, and is further analyzed and discussed in subsection 5.6 and Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Comparison among the fuzzy-theoretic methods</head><p>The performance differences among the fuzzy set theoretic similarity based approaches are analyzed using Bonferroni test, and the analysis and results are reported in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The results show the different alternative combination of fuzzy set theoretic similarity measures and aggregation methods have significant and different effects on recommendation accuracy. For precision, cosine and fuzzy set are better choices. For recall, fuzzy set and correlation are better choices when the aggregation method is weighted-sum, and cosine is the better choice when the aggregation method is max-min. For F1 measure, correlation and fuzzy set are better choices when the aggregation method is weighted-sum, and cosine is the better choice when the aggregation method is max-min. In all cases, distance based similarity performs poorly. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Training size and recommendation size sensitivity analysis</head><p>Since similar results are obtained in both aggregation methods, results from Weighted-sum aggregation method are presented. Overall, as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>, precision and recall do not increase as the model size (training size) increases. The reason is once sufficient number of items that suggest the preference of a user are gathered, additional feedback on items do not improve the preference of the user as well as the recommendation accuracy. Pair-wise mean comparison test shows no significant difference in both precision and recall due to variation in training size. A similar pattern is also reported in the literature, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The results are also consistent across all the similarity measures and the two aggregation methods. Overall, a training size of 5-15 produces mean precision between 0.47 and 0.59.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>, when the size of the recommendation list increases, the precision is not significantly increasing. Hence an FTM based recommender system does not need to recommend a large number of movies to achieve a better precision.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>, recall increases as the number of recommended items increases. The results are consistent across all the similarity measures and the two aggregation methods. Furthermore, overall, a recommendation of 3-10 items produces mean precision between 0.45 and 0.55.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Using the baseline CSM (7) based recommender system that use genres and ratings represented in crisp set results in lower precision compared to the FTM based recommender systems that use genres and ratings represented using fuzzy set. For FTM, the mean precision increases approximately by 6%, which is significant at 5%. Precision is improved because handling of the non-stochastic uncertainty using the fuzzy theoretic-based representation and inference mechanism reduce the noises in the recommender system processes. However, recall is not improved. Further investigation of the other factors reveals that compared to precision, recall is highly affected by recommendation size and training size. For fixed recall, compared with CSM, precision is improved by the FTM (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The improvement is very important for recommender systems where precision is more important than recall. Recommender systems are expected to recommend only a limited number of items, usually 5-20.</p><p>For precision, there is no significance difference between the two aggregation methods. However, compared to weighted-sum strategy, the max-min strategy produces better performance in terms of recall. In weighted-sum strategy as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, both the similarity between the targeted movie and previously rated movies, and the degree of interest to the previously rated movies contribute to recommendation confidence score. In max-min strategy as in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">9</ref>), the recommendation confidence score is dominated by either the similarity or the degree of interest to the previously rated movies. This variation could contribute to the difference in recall between the two strategies.</p><p>The variations in performance by similarity measures are attributed to the inherent nature of item feature. For movies, the movie by genre matrix that is used to compute similarity is sparse. Nearly 50%, 34%, 13%, 3%, 0.7%, or 0.3% of the movies in the data set have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 genres, respectively. For a movie with vector of size 20 genres most of the values are zeros. The sparsity in the movies by genres matrix has different effects on the performance.</p><p>The sparsity in the movie by genres matrix has less effects on the cosine and fuzzy set based similarity measures. The cosine measure is based on magnitude and direction of the vectors. Furthermore, the fuzzy set based similarity measure is based on the set-theoretic operations on fuzzy sets, fuzzy set cardinality and commonality of attributes. These two similarity measures capture a scale invariant understanding of similarity, and it ignores the effect of the proportional size differences.</p><p>In case of proximity measure, the similarity coefficient can be nonzero even when there is no common element between two objects. This means that fuzzy sets with non-empty intersection can have the same similarity as fuzzy sets with empty intersection. Correlation produces the next poor performance because it is a weighted squared Euclidean distance, and it has similar characteristics as the proximity measure. The sensitivity analysis shows the effect of the model size and recommendation size factors on the recommendation accuracy. The FTM was found to be highly insensitive to the training size, and the results are consistent across the two aggregation methods and all the similarity measures. The stability in FTM can be attributed to its inherent representation and inference techniques. As a result, to gain a good precision, FTM requires fewer training cases and needs to provide a few recommendations. Hence the FTM based algorithms are scalable and appropriate for online recommendation.</p><p>Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> compared content-based approach and collaborative filtering, and they found that the mere introduction of movie features alone does not improve precision. One possible reason for the poor performance of the content-based method could be the representation scheme used for the various multi-valued and non-numerical features. Unlike our fuzzy set based representation of movies' content, the genres have crisp representation; and also genres and other non-numerical features are approximated by mean rating of those movies rated with the features' values.</p><p>Creating an equivalent base for a fair comparison between the results of the proposed approach and the results of reported studies for movies recommendation using the same MovieLens dataset is not straightforward. For example, comparison with collaborative filtering algorithms sounds unfair because our approach has additional item features. Moreover, the experimental set-ups are different. Notwithstanding these limitations, we present the results of our method and the results of equivalent CF from the literature. We are attempting to show that the proper introduction of content information in recommender systems improves precision.</p><p>Using the same dataset as our study, user-based CF using belief distribution and nearest-neighbor algorithms resulted in an optimal top-15 mean precision of 23% <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>; top-15 mean precision for FTM is in the range of 50-55% as indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>. Similarly, user-based CF resulted in an optimal top-10 mean F1-measure of 23% <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>; Top-15 mean F1- measure for FTM is in the range of 25-32%. Hence, the present study shows proper introduction of movie features does improve precision without loss of recall. Some of the other potential applications of the FTM are for information filtering, tutoring systems, and web mining. The successful application of the proposed method for the movie recommender system makes its extension to recommendation of other similar items such as music, jokes, and books evident. The application of the proposed method for information filtering such as news filtering is also possible. For instance, representation of user news interest, content of news, and their relationship as well as computing similarity and recommendation scores can be done in similar ways as for the movie recommender system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and future research directions</head><p>The study presents a fuzzy set theoretic method (FTM) for item recommender systems. Using data on movies, the results of the simulation study provide empirical evidence that supports the effectiveness of FTM in terms of better precision, and lower model size and recommendation size. Furthermore, the study shows that the different alternative combination of fuzzy set theoretic similarity measures and aggregation methods have significant and different effects on recommendation accuracy.</p><p>Compared to the baseline CSM, FTM improves the precision without loss in recall. Therefore, the study shows the use of fuzzy modeling as the foundation for representing and reasoning on non-stochastic uncertainty can improve the effectiveness of content-based recommender systems.</p><p>Further studies are planned to extend the FTM in several directions. First, inclusion of additional attributes, e.g. actors/actresses, and directors for movies, are expected to improve the performance of the system. Second, different membership functions, different aggregator operators and linguistic quantifiers need to be considered, and then empirically tested in order to get an optimal fuzzy set based recommender system. Third, there is a need for testing the FTM approach with additional datasets from other domain applications before making further generalization. Fourth, extending the FTM method to support collaborative filtering is essential. Fifth, the use of membership degrees of genres in movies obtained using the membership function for the application of the Bayesian's method (forming Fuzzy-Bayesian approach) for modeling stochastic uncertainty is an exciting study that demands a separate research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
