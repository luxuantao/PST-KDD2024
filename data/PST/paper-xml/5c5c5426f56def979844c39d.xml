<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Parkinson's disease is a continuing nervous system disorder that originates due to the loss of brain cells which further influences movement. Symptoms start gradually, some of the common early stage symptoms are slowed movement, tremors, rigid muscle, impaired posture and balance, speech changes, handwriting changes etc. The nerve cells gradually become incapable of communicating with each other which results in depression and other nervous system ailments. Parkinson disease should be uncovered timely as there is no cure present till date. Handwriting and speech patterns tend to change in the earlier stage which aids in detecting the disease. Erdogu Sakar et al. freshly prepared a dataset that comprises of examining of speech i.e patients are examined on their speaking ability of vowels 'a' and 'o' <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Apart from speech pattern, handwriting pattern can also be used in figuring out the disease by examining the kind of figures drawn by the patients and healthy persons. A handwriting exam is conducted and individuals are supposed to draw figures of meanders and spiral in the air and in black and white in two different directions i.e. clockwise and anticlockwise. To categorize individuals as a patient or a healthy one; a number of factors are taken into consideration including right/left handedness, an age of the individual, the mean as well as maximum distance amongst actual exam outline and the handwriting marked during the exam, and time taken for drawing the particular figure. The dataset given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is derived from the results of a recent study conducted by Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University -Brazil, where the data of numerous affected individuals were collected and pooled in for analysis. In this paper modified Grey Wolf algorithm is used to conclude whether the individual is affected by the disease or not on the basis of speech data gathered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. A systematic review of the technologies as a tool for treatment of the disease has been done <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>It is observed that over the last two decades volume of data has increased drastically which also creeps in many problems associated with the data. The work of preprocessing and processing of data is a tedious task as the escalation in instances count and features count leads to increase in the volume of data. Growth in data makes it more susceptible to noise, which can lead to a drop in performance and degraded result. Thus, it becomes essential to treat the data. Computational cost and complexity tend to increase when huge data is put to use. Thus, for building models in machine learning; vital role is played by feature selection. In feature selection otherwise known as variable selection, a subset of features are chosen from the set of available features. The main focus is to keep the accuracy of the model good before and after feature selection. Feature selection helps in addressing the issues of computational cost and complexity of dataset by reducing them. It also helps in avoiding over-fitting of the model and evade curse of dimensionality. Feature selection can be categorized under various methods i.e. filter, wrapper and embedded. The wrapper methods are generally classified into Heuristic Search Algorithms and Sequential Search Algorithms. These days, it is observed that effective feature extraction has become a necessity. Effective feature selection that intends to classify the big data via social IoT <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and some applications using IoT have been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Larger sample quantities are quantified using geophysical techniques and consequently are put to incorporate huge areas economically, that may perhaps not find success by various other procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.In the market of e-commerce, online ranking analysis of reviews of customer products a paper makes use of opinion mining by means of clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.

Live auction and SDLC datasets has been discoursed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. A number of bio-inspired algorithms have been proposed and implement for effective feature of software based usability models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> like modified crow search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, modified binary bat algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, modified whale optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.

The prediction of disease can be synchronized <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and uniquely identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Biological evolution is mainly focused by evolutionary algorithms which is a subset of artificial intelligence. Reproduction, mutation, recombination and selection are different types of processes of biological evolution. Evolutionary algorithm is distinct from previous optimization techniques as it is based on random sampling. The processes of biological evolution are recurrently applied on the solutions correctly specified as population. The solution's quality is determined by the fitness function. In accordance to the evolutionary process the solutions are subjected to change, this ultimately ends up providing a universal solution to the problem. Fundamental fitness landscape is not taken into consideration by evolutionary algorithms and hence, they have been acknowledged to perform well under diverse circumstances. Complex problems can be easily solved by a basic evolutionary algorithm but its computation cost factor is a major and only set back. This setback can be reduced to a great extent by fitness function approximation. Various sorts of evolutionary algorithms exist like genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies and evolutionary programming <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>.</p><p>In the recent past it is observed that quantum of work has increased manifold in the fields of meta-heuristic algorithms and evolutionary algorithms; which are based on genetic and natureinspired algorithms and involves computation of a fitness function that eliminates the insignificant solutions and works on the decent solutions which leads to optimizing of the genetic line ahead; using two popular theories of mutation and survival of the fittest. There are many nature-inspired algorithms likewise Firefly Algorithm proposed by Xin-She Yang which is based on fireflies flashing characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. Taking into consideration echoing features of a bat; he has proposed another algorithm namely Bat Algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. Numerous other algorithms encompass ant colony optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, gravitational search algorithm founded on the association amid gravity and mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Pham et al. gave Bees Algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> and Erik Cuevas et al. gave CAB algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>. Genetic Algorithm is used to manage and secure the blockchain based system <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) is the main evolutionary algorithm proposed by Mirjalili et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> which imitates the leadership hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. The grey wolves has been divided into four types -alpha, beta, delta, and omega wolf in the simulation of leadership hierarchy while the hunting behavior includes looking, hunting, circumscribing the prey and attacking. This nature-inspired mechanism has been trained for Multi-layer perceptron (Feedforward Neural Networks) in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. Taking into consideration of the above notions, we have introduced a novel Modified Grey Wolf Optimization (MGWO) stirred by the hunting pattern of grey wolves depending on various features involved and environment adding the element of feature extraction. MGWO can be dubbed as an optimized version of the original GWO. Various fitness functions are used to optimize the proposed algorithm in comparison to the original one. MGWO has been applied to Parkinson's speech, voice PD and Hand PD (spiral and meander) datasets so that Parkinson disease could be detected at an early stage and proper treatment is initiated for the same. The algorithm extracts the perpetual attributes competently with an average accuracy of 94%.</p><p>One of the significant areas of research these days is online smart healthcare technologies integrated with IoT. One such instance is mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> where a convolutional neural network is used for bio-medical image segmentation along with hardware acceleration. If MGWO is implemented online then input drawings can give reasonable predictions in real time scenarios. Auxiliary studies can be carried on by the use of intensified reality or similar concepts that support the creation of virtual environments for the treatment of Parkinson disease as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>. Security becomes a vital concern when healthcare data is dealt with online. Proper methods should be implemented to ensure the security of data transmitted in IoT based health <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. New algorithms have been modeled and designed to be applied on the image dataset for the Parkinson's disease. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref> demonstrates an adaptive method that can be used to segment lung images and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref> demonstrates a novel method that extracts features from various medical images. The other evolutionary algorithms like cuttlefish <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> and crow search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> are used for optimal feature selection for early diagnosis of Parkinson disease and detection of blood cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. a convolution neural network is developed to learn from handwritten exam images <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</p><p>The paper highlights the following points:</p><p>• Using a bio-inspired algorithm for early detection of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>• This work has proposed a modified grey wolf optimization algorithm (MGWO) to find the optimal subset of features search strategy.</p><p>• The proposed algorithm has its application in the diagnosis of the Parkinson's disease.</p><p>• K-nearest neighbor, random forest and decision tree have been applied to predict the accuracy on the selected features.</p><p>• The algorithm is evaluated using three performance metrics-Accuracy, Detection Rate and False Alarm Rate.</p><p>• MGWO has been evaluated on various datasets; like voice PD, sound recordings, and Parkinson's HandPD (spiral and meander); for the detection of Parkinson disease with an approximate accuracy of 94%</p><p>• Our main aim is to keep our proposed and implemented modified Grey Wolf optimization algorithm as straightforward, uncomplicated and reasonable as possible.</p><p>The paper is organized as, the background algorithm has been presented in section 2; followed by the introduction of MGWO for feature selection and the implementation of proposed MGWO in section3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Traditional Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)</head><p>Feature extraction selects a lesser number of optimized features from a set of all features without affecting the performance of the system; thus maintaining higher accuracy. As number of features involved in machine learning tasks is hefty, various types of methods have been implemented which attempt to solve the problem of reducing redundant and irrelevant data features.</p><p>Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) is a meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by grey wolves and proposed by Mirjalili et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> which imitates the leadership chain of command and hunting behavior of grey wolves. Alpha, beta, gamma and delta wolf are the four types in which wolves are divided in the simulation of leadership hierarchy while the hunting behavior includes finding out prey, surrounding prey and hunting prey <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. The alpha wolf has been the leader wolf and pecking orders and decisions to the other wolves in the pack. Beta wolf is below the alpha wolf, these wolves obey the alpha wolf and they give instructions to other wolves. Omega wolves stand lowest in the hierarchy and must report to the wolves above. Delta wolf is the category, which includes the wolves that doesn't belong to alpha, beta or omega category. Various roles are played by them; they could be spies that lookout the boundaries and generates alert during the situation of danger or they could play the role of guard that ensures the protection and safety of the pack. To achieve optimization, GWO algorithm uses a mathematical model that represents the hunting behavior of grey wolves. The grey wolves surround their prey by making a circle as shown in fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the mathematical equations representing this encircling behavior are proposed in the paper Grey Wolf Optimizer. The equations are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1) (2) (3) (4)</formula><p>where t is the current run, A and C are coefficient vectors, X p is the position vector of the prey, and the position vector of a grey wolf is indicated by X. Components of a are linearly decreased from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations and r1, r2 are random vectors in [0, 1].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1: Updating the positions of grey wolves after every iteration</head><p>In the beginning, the wolves are positioned at random locations with reference to the location of the prey and further value of fitness function is computed for various random locations of wolves; consequently alpha, beta, gamma, delta solutions are taken note of. Throughout the simulation of GWO, the iteration apprises in the locations of all the grey wolves is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Fitness function is reliant on distance assessment amongst the prey and the various wolves. The distance evaluated acts as a decisive factor in finding out the optimized solution determined by fitness function i.e. the wolf that is found to be nearest in location to the prey; has the higher probability of continuing to be closest to the prey in near future's time. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates the repeated iterations solution's as depicted by the alpha, beta, gamma and delta wolves. Algorithm1 exemplifies Grey Wolf Optimization. The GWO has been represented by the following equation (5, 6, and 7) and Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>  The traditional algorithm of GWO for solving complex problems are given below in algorithm 1 and the flowchart is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Show the results</head><p>The proposed algorithm used for the identification of Parkinson disease has been modified to increase the performance. The changes introduced in the algorithm are listed below:</p><p>• The modified grey wolf optimizer has been developed for multiple feature selection which is an extension to the original GWO that could only be implemented on the mathematical function. • The fitness function is calculating the fitness for each agent using the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">fnt = imp + wf × (1 -( lf / lt ) ) (8)</formula><p>Here, the imp is the summation of each feature importance that is selected. Feature importance is an attribute of RandomForestClassifier from library sklearn Feature importance generates a value between 0 and 1 for each feature according to their importance in predicting the target. The total of all the feature importance is always equal to 1.</p><p>wf is the weight factor, it creates a balance between the feature importance, imp and the number of selected features.</p><p>lf is the number of selected features. lt is the total number of the features present in the dataset. • The positions of the wolves are updated on conditions as given in the algorithm.</p><p>Alpha_score holds the best fitness value and the Alpha_pos stores the set of positions in the space which provides the best fitness. • The sigmoid of X is found using the equation 2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">sig_X= 1/( 1 + exp(( 10*(X-0.5 ) ) )) (9)</formula><p>• The positions of the Alpha_pos are used for the features selection and different machine learning algorithms: k-NN, Random Forest, Decision Tree has been applied to the selected positions. Best prediction is the desired result.</p><p>Flowchart of the MGWO algorithm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM</head><p>Here, the proposed algorithm has been implemented. This section comprises of the experimental setup, input parameters, machine learning algorithms and their tuning parameters and lastly, the datasets have been discussed. MGWO first selects the best features out of the full set of features and then uses different classifiers to train and test on the datasets. The model of the proposed algorithm is depicted in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Experimental Setup</head><p>The algorithm has been experimented on the system having the configuration of 1.80 GHz Core 2 CPU with minimum 2 GB of memory under Ubuntu version 14.04. We have implemented the algorithm using Python version 3.6.3:: Anaconda, Inc. Sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib are the libraries used for implementation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Machine learning models</head><p>Three well known machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the target. The datasets are divided into 70:30 ratio for the purpose of training and testing respectively and are shuffled so that overfitting can be avoided. k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification problems. k is a positive integer used for categorizing the object to the most common class in the neighborhood. The value of k is to be 3 in our research paper. For classification and regression learning algorithm decision tree is used. Decision tree uses trees to divide the population into subpopulations. Random forest creates a forest of trees for solving regression and classification problems. The tuning parameters for the learning algorithms are listed in table 2.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results and Discussions</head><p>The proposed algorithm is applied to different PD datasets and in this section the results have been discussed. We have also compared the novel algorithm MGWO with Optimized Cuttlefish Algorithm (OCFA). This section first shows the results obtained by MGWO using K-NN, Random Forest, and Decision tree. Three performance metrics are used to evaluate the model on datasets : Accuracy (AR), Detection Rate (DR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR). Accuracy is defined as how often the classifier correctly identifies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FAR=</head><p>The performance of a classifier is said be good when the values of AR, DR are higher while values of FAR is lower. After applying the MGWO classifiers to four described datasets, the best accuracy has been obtained and it has been compared with the accuracy of OCFA for the respective datasets. The features selected by MGWO and OCFA is also compared. At last the convergence rate for all the datasets is shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">The results obtained by MGWO using different models</head><p>In our algorithm, we have used three different well-known machine learning models: KNN, Random Forest and Decision tree. The table 3 (i), 3 (ii), 3 (iii), 3 (iv) shows the values of AR, DR and FAR for the proposed model when evaluated on PD datasets: Hand PD spiral, Hand PD meander, Speech PD, Voice PD respectively. Using the table 3 accuracy, detection rate and false alarm rate for them is shown in fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref>, 13, 14 respectively. We can observe from the fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref>, 13, 14 that MGWO using Random Forest provides the best results.      The accuracy obtained from the selected features of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of Optimized Cuttlefish Algorithm (OCFA). The comparison between the two algorithms is shown in fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref> and 14 below. From the figures, we can observe that the proposed algorithm has better accuracy with the fewer selected number of features as compared to OCFA. The comparison of accuracy obtained from the selected features between the two algorithms is shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15</ref> and<ref type="figure">16</ref>. The convergence rate for datasets which can be defined as how the algorithm converges towards the global optima is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">17</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS</head><p>This work proposes an altered version of a bio-inspired optimization algorithm namely modified Grey Wolf Optimization (MGWO) for identification of the Parkinson's disease in a patient. Section 3.1 presents the proposed algorithm. Different datasets for Parkinson's disease diagnosis has been applied to the proposed MGWO whose spatial distribution presented in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>, 9, 10, and 11. The reduced set of features are obtained using Modified Grey Wolf algorithm. The comparative accuracy of the proposed algorithm along with its computational time is determined without losing on the performance measure of the model. The proposed algorithm selects a fewer number of features as compared to OCFA and has a higher accuracy of 94.83% approximately. The results show that MGWO using random forest outperforms other classifiers in terms of accuracy, detection rate and false alarm rate. The results depict that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional grey wolf algorithm. The proposed algorithm could be applied for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and also for the purpose of feature selection.</p><p>Further study can be conducted by formulating new methods in order to combine the models of HandPD, SpeechPD and voice datasets so that early detection could be carried out with better accuracy. Apart from Hand, Speech and Voice method of detection other methods could also be examined and applied to the proposed algorithm for the verification of the results. As MGWO is applied to Parkinson disease optimization problem, to obtain better results it can be applied to other optimization problems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>:</figDesc></figure>
