<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, Sphere Decoding (SD) algorithms for Spatial Modulation (SM) are developed to reduce the computational complexity of Maximum-Likelihood (ML-) optimum detectors, which have a complexity that linearly increases with the product of number of transmit-antenna, receive-antenna, and size of the modulation scheme. Three SDs specifically designed for SM are proposed and analysed in terms of Bit Error Probability (BEP) and computational complexity. By judiciously choosing some key parameters, e.g., the radius of the sphere centered around the received signal, it is shown that the proposed algorithms offer the same BEP as ML-optimum detection, with a significant reduction of the computational complexity. Also, it is shown that none of the proposed SDs is always superior to the others, but the best SD to use depends on the system setup, i.e., the number of transmit-antenna, receive-antenna, and the size of the modulation scheme. The computational complexity trade-off offered by the proposed solutions is studied via analysis and simulation, and numerical results are shown to validate our findings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Spatial Modulation (SM) is a recently proposed transmission technology for Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless systems, which has been originally proposed to increase the spectral efficiency of single-antenna systems by avoiding Inter-Channel Interference (ICI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This is attained through the adoption of a new modulation and coding scheme, which foresees: i) the activation, at each time instance, of a single antenna that transmits a given data symbol (constellation symbol), and ii) the exploitation of the spatial position (index) of the active antenna as an additional dimension for data transmission (spatial symbol). Both constellation symbol and spatial symbol depend on the incoming data bits. Thereby, an overall increase, by the base-two logarithm of the number of transmit-antenna, of the spectral efficiency is achieved, while still retaining a complexity comparable to single-antenna systems.</p><p>In particular, at the receiver the Maximum Likelihood (ML) optimum decoder is a simple single-stream detector, which performs an exhaustive search over the whole constellation symbol and spatial symbol space, and whose computational complexity (C) linearly increases with the product of transmitantenna (N t ), receive-antenna (N r ), and size of the modula-tion scheme (M ), i.e., C ∝ MN t N r <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Unlike other spatial multiplexing schemes for MIMO systems, such as the V-BLAST (Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, there is a substantial reduction in receiver complexity, as no multi-stream detectors with exponential-growing complexity with N t are required. In addition to this significant complexity reduction, SM also outperforms many conventional single-antenna and multi-antenna wireless systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, thus potentially being an appealing transmission concept for the next generation of wireless systems.</p><p>In spite of its low-complexity implementation and superior performance results, there still is potential for further computational complexity reductions, especially when: i) high spectral efficiencies are required (i.e., the product MN t is large), or ii) high diversity gains and, thus, low error probabilities, are needed (i.e., N r is large). Furthermore, complexity issues become even more pressing when both MN t and N r are large. Motivated by these considerations, some recent research works have focused on developing low-complexity detectors for SM. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> two sub-optimal twostep detectors based on heuristics are proposed. However, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> it is shown that the detector in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> belongs to the family of non-exact methods, and in general it is a few dB worse than the ML-optimum detector. On the other hand, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> an exact low-complexity detector for SM has been proposed, which is based on the Sphere Decoding (SD) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therein, it is shown that the proposed solution has a computational complexity that is bounded by 8MN t ≤ C ≤ 8MN t N r , and it provides an error performance very close to the ML-optimum detector. This SD-based detector is especially suitable when the number of receive-antenna N r is very large, as it reduces the size of the search space related to the multiple antennas at the receiver (we denote this search space as "receive search space"). However, it has two main limitations: i) it does not reduce the dimension of the search space due to the number, N t , of transmit-antenna and the size, M , of the signal modulation diagram (we denote this search space as "transmit search space"), which prevents the detector from achieving a significant reduction in computational complexity when high data rates are required (i.e., when both N t and M are large), and ii) the detector has the same complexity as the MLoptimum decoder when N r = 1. In general, the reduction in decoding complexity is not very high when N r is small, as often happens in the downlink of cellular systems. The detector in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is here called Receiver-centric SD (Rx-SD).</p><p>Motivated by these considerations, in this paper we move from the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and propose two new low-complexity detectors for SM, which are based on the SD principle. The first solution aims at reducing the "transmit search space", and, thus, can be seen as a complementary solution to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In particular, as opposed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the proposed decoder is suitable when either N t or M , or both N t and M are large. On the other hand, it keeps the "receive search space" the same as the original ML-optimum decoder. This detector is called Transmitter-centric SD (Tx-SD). On the other hand, the second solution combines both Rx-SD and Tx-SD with the aim of reducing the complexity of the ML-optimum receiver in both the receive and transmit search spaces. This detector is called Combined-SD (C-SD). More specifically, the Tx-SD detector is based on a simplified implementation of the conventional SD proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which exploits the peculiar property of SM that only a single antenna is active at any time instance. Due to space constraints, in this paper we focus on the so-called non-underdetermined MIMO setup with N t ≤ N r . In the recent period, some efficient SD methods for the underdetermined MIMO setup have been proposed (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and references therein). However, the analysis of this setup for SM is postponed to a future research contribution.</p><p>In this paper, we provide a careful study of the performance of these three detectors, along with an accurate comparison of their computational complexity. Numerical results show that the proposed solutions provide a substantial reduction in computational complexity with respect to the ML-optimum detector, and no loss in the Bit Error Probability (BEP). Furthermore, it is shown that the Rx-SD is less complex than the C-SD when M is not very large, while the C-SD is the best solution when either M is large or N r is small. The reminder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section II, the system model along with the ML-optimum and Rx-SD detectors are summarised. In Section III, the new Tx-SD and C-SD receivers are described. In Section IV, an accurate analysis of the computational complexity of Tx-SD and C-SD is performed. In Section V, some numerical results are shown to compare the proposed receivers. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. SM Modulator</head><p>SM works as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The bitstream emitted by a binary source is divided into blocks containing log 2 (N t ) + log 2 (M ) bits each, with log 2 (N t ) and log 2 (M ) being the number of bits needed to identify the spatial symbol and the constellation symbol, respectively. Each block is split into two sub-blocks of log 2 (N t ) and log 2 (M ) bits each, and the following mapping rule is used:</p><p>• The bits in the first sub-block are used to select the antenna that is switched on for data transmission, while all the other transmit-antenna are kept silent. In this paper, the actual transmit-antenna that is active for transmission is denoted by t , with t ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N t }. • The bits in the second sub-block are used to choose a symbol in the signal-constellation diagram. Without loss of generality, Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is considered. In this paper, the actual complex symbol emitted by the transmit-antenna t is denoted by s t , with</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s t ∈ {s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s M }.</formula><p>Accordingly, the N t × 1 transmitted vector is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x t,st = 0 1×( t-1) , s t , 0 1×(Nt-t) T (1)</formula><p>where</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[•]</head><p>T denotes transpose operation, and 0 p×q is a p × q matrix with all-zero entries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Channel Model</head><p>The modulated vector, x t,st , in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is transmitted through a frequency-flat N r × N t MIMO fading channel with transfer function H. In this paper, a Rayleigh fading channel model is assumed, and, thus, the entries of H are modeled as complex independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian random variables with zero-mean and unit-variance. Moreover, a perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver is assumed, with no CSI at the transmitter.</p><p>Thus, the N r × 1 received vector can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y = Hx t,st + n (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where n is the N r -dimensional Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with zero-mean and variance σ 2 per dimension at the receiver input.</p><p>From (1), (2) simplifies as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y = h t s t + n<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where h t is the t -th column of H.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. ML-Optimum Detector</head><p>The optimum detector based on the ML principle has been derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ˆ (ML) t , ŝ(ML) t = arg min ∈{1,2,...Nt} s∈{s1,s2,...sM } y -h s 2 F = arg min ∈{1,2,...Nt} s∈{s1,s2,...sM } Nr r=1 |y r -h ,r s| 2 (4)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">• 2 F is the Frobenius norm,</formula><p>• identifies the estimated spatial and constellation symbols, and y r and h ,r is the r-th entry of y and h , respectively.</p><p>The computational complexity of (4), in terms of real multiplications, is equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">C ML = 8MN t N r (5)</formula><p>as the ML detector searches through the whole transmit and receive search spaces. Note that evaluating the Euclidean distance |y rh ,r s| 2 requires 8 real multiplications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Rx-SD Detector</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, a reduced-complexity and close-to-optimal BEPachieving decoder is proposed, which, as mentioned in Section I, aims at reducing the receive search space. The detector can formally be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ˆ (Rx-SD) t , ŝ(Rx-SD) t = argmin ∈{1,2,...N t } s∈{s 1 ,s 2 ,...s M } Ñr ( ,s)=Nr ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ Ñr ( ,s) r=1 yr -h ,r s 2 ⎫ ⎬ ⎭<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">1 ≤ Ñr ( , s) ≤ N</formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">Ñr ( , s) = max n∈{1,2,...Nr} n n r=1 |y r -h ,r s| 2 ≤ R 2<label>(7)</label></formula><p>In other words, for each ∈ {1, 2, . . . N t } and s ∈ {s 1 , s 2 , . . . s M }, the Rx-SD receiver does not combine, according to the Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the signals received by all the N r antennas at the receiver, but it keeps combining the received signals until the Euclidean norm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> gives a point that lies inside a sphere of radius R and centered around the received signal itself. However, since the points in the actual search space are only those for which we have Ñr (•, •) = N r , it can be shown that there is no loss in either the diversity or the coding gain: the BEP is very close to that of the ML detector in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> the interested reader can find an accurate analysis of the computational complexity of the Rx-SD detector along with an efficient method to choose the radius R, which significantly affects the performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we simply mention that:</p><p>• The complexity of the Rx-SD receiver is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">C Rx-SD = 8 Nt =1 M s=1 Ñr ( , s)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>It is easy to show that C Rx-SD lies in the interval</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">8MN t ≤ C Rx-SD ≤ 8MN t N r ,</formula><p>where the lower bound corresponds to the scenario where Ñr ( , s) = 1 for ∈ {1, 2, . . . N t } and s ∈ {s 1 , s 2 , . . . s M }, and the upper bound corresponds to the scenario where Ñr ( , s) = N r for ∈ {1, 2, . . . N t } and s ∈ {s 1 , s 2 , . . . s M }. In other words, in the best-case scenario Rx-SD has the same complexity as a Multiple-Input-Single-Output (MISO) system, while in the worst-case scenario it has the same complexity as the ML-optimum detector in (4). These results suggest that the larger N r , the higher the potential gain with respect to the ML-optimum receiver. Let us note that the Rx-SD solution has no pre-computations with respect to the ML-optimum detector. In fact, Ñr ( , s) for ∈ {1, 2, . . . N t } and s ∈ {s 1 , s 2 , . . . s M } in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> are implicitly computed when solving the hypothesisdetection problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><p>• The radius R can be chosen as R = 2αN r σ 2 , where α is the solution of the equation as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">γ (N r , 2αN r ) Γ (N r ) = 1 -ε (9)</formula><p>and γ (x, a) = a 0 ξ x-1 exp (-ξ) dξ is the lower incomplete Gamma function, Γ (x) = +∞ 0 ξ x-1 exp (-ξ) dξ is the Gamma function, and ε is an arbitrary small value close to zero, e.g., ε = 10 -6 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. NEW LOW-COMPLEXITY SPHERE DECODERS FOR SM</head><p>As anticipated in Section I, in this section two new SDs for SM are introduced. The first one (Tx-SD), aims at reducing the transmit search space, as opposed to the Rx-SD search space, and the second one (C-SD) combines Rx-SD and Tx-SD decoders in order to reduce both transmit and receive search spaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Tx-SD Detector</head><p>The Tx-SD for SM is a modified version of the wellknown SD for MIMO systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It, however, exploits the peculiar property of SM that only a single antenna is active for transmission. More specifically, similar to conventional SDs, the Tx-SD scheme reduces the number of points ( , s) for ∈ {1, 2, . . . N t } and s ∈ {s 1 , s 2 , . . . s M } to be searched through in (4), i.e., the transmit search space, by computing the Euclidean distances only for those points that lie inside a sphere with radius R and centered around the received signal. However, unlike conventional SDs, in our scheme the set of points inside the sphere are much simpler to be computed, as there is only a single active antenna in SM. In this section, using the condition that the point has to lie inside a sphere with radius R, an intervals are computed, while in the next section we provide an estimate of the computational complexity of the proposed detector.</p><p>The analytical derivation follows the notations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which here are briefly summarised to make the paper self-contained. First, for ease of analytical derivation, the complex-valued model in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) is replaced by its real-valued equivalent, as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ȳ = Hx t,st + n (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where ȳ is a 2N r ×1 receive vector, H is a 2N r ×2N t channel matrix, x t,st is 2N t × 1 transmit vector, and n is a 2N r × 1 noise vector, defined as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ȳ = Re y T ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">⎞ ⎠ 2 ≤ R 2 Q ⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭<label>(17)</label></formula><p>By performing QR factorisation of the matrix H, (10) can be re-written as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ȳ = Q P 0 (2Nr-2Nt)×2Nt x t,st + n (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where P is a 2N t × 2N t upper triangular matrix, Q = Q1 Q2 , and Q1 , Q2 are 2N r × 2N t and 2N r × (2N r -2N t ) matrices, respectively.</p><p>The Tx-SD scheme can be formally written as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_20">ˆ (Tx-SD) t , ŝ<label>(</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">i) z = Q T 1 ȳ, ii) R 2 Q = R 2 -QT 2 ȳ</formula><p>2 F , iii) zi and xi ( , s) are the i-th entry of vectors z and x ,s , respectively, and iv) pi,j is the (i, j)-th entry of matrix P.</p><p>The main reason why the Tx-SD enjoys reduced computational complexity compared to the ML-optimum detector is the efficient computation of the subset Θ R , which should avoid an exhaustive search in the whole transmit search space. As far as SM is concerned, these points can be computed in a very simple way, as summarised in Lemma 1.</p><p>Lemma 1: The subset of points Θ R in (17) lie in the intervals:</p><p>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">19</ref>), and we have defined zi,i+Nt = zipi,i+Nt xi+Nt ( , s). Proof:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">R Q + zi pi,i ≤ xi ( , s) ≤ R Q + zi pi,i<label>(18)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">-R Q + zi,i+Nt pi,i ≤ xi ( , s) ≤ R Q + zi,i+Nt pi,i<label>(19)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">for i = 2N t , 2N t -1, . . . , N t + 1 in (18), i = N t , N t - 1, . . . , 1 in (</formula><p>1) First, we note that a necessary condition that the points of the transmit search space need to satisfy in order to belong to the subset Θ R in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">17</ref>) is (for all i = 1, 2, . . . , 2N t ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">⎛ ⎝ zi - 2Nt j=i pi,j xj ( , s) ⎞ ⎠ 2 ≤ R 2 Q (20)</formula><p>which is a condition similar to conventional SD algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. By comparing the intervals in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">19</ref>) with those of a conventional SD <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we notice that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">19</ref>) are much simpler, and this is due to the fact that in SM there is only one active antenna element, while in conventional SDs all the antennas transmit simultaneously. Note that, as (19) depends implicitly on (18), this means that (19) needs to be computed for all the points that lie in the interval in <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>.</p><p>With respect to the Rx-SD scheme, the Tx-SD scheme requires some pre-computations to estimate the points that lie inside the sphere of radius R. These additional computations are carefully taken into account in the analysis of the computational complexity of the Tx-SD scheme and its comparison with the ML-optimum detector (see Section IV). Furthermore, we note that the radius R in (17) can still be computed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. C-SD Detector</head><p>In Section II-D and Section III-A, we have seen that Rx-SD and Tx-SD aim at reducing the complexity of the MLoptimum detector by minimising the size of the receive and transmit search spaces, respectively. So, it is natural to combine both of them to further decrease the receiver complexity by reducing the size of both search spaces. The proposed C-SD is a two-step detector that works as follows:</p><p>1) First, the Tx-SD algorithm is used to reduce the transmit search space. The subset of points Θ R is computed as shown in (17). 2) Second, the Rx-SD algorithm is used to reduce the receive search space. More specifically, Rx-SD is applied only on the subset of points Θ R computed in the step above.</p><p>In formulas, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">ˆ (C-SD) t , ŝ(C-SD) t = arg min ( ,s)∈Θ R Ñr( ,s)=Nr ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ Ñr( ,s) r=1 |y r -h ,r s| 2 ⎫ ⎬ ⎭<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where Θ R and Ñr ( , s) are computed by using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">17</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">7</ref>), respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ANALYSIS OF COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY</head><p>In this section, we analyse the computational complexity of Tx-SD and C-SD algorithms by taking into account the precomputations needed to estimate the points of the reduced search space. In this paper, the complexity is defined as the total number of real multiplications and divisions required.

Tx-SD</head><p>The computational complexity of Tx-SD can be estimated by taking into account that:</p><p>1) The QR factorisation in (15), when computed by using the Householder algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, requires a number of real multiplications equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">C QR = N k=1 2f (k) + f 2 (k) + 2f 3 (k) + 1 -N 3 r (22)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">f (k) = N r + 1 -k and N = min {N r -1, N t }. 2) The computation of z = Q T 1 ȳ in (17) needs 4N t N r real multiplications, i.e., C z = 4N t N r . 3) The computation of QT 2 ȳ 2 F in (17) needs C QT 2 ȳ 2 F = 2N r (2N r -2N t + 1) real multiplications, i.e., C QT 2 ȳ 2 F = 2N r (2N r -2N t + 1).</formula><p>4) The computation of the intervals in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">18</ref>) and (19) requires: i) 2N t real divisions to compute (18) for N t antenna indexes; and ii) 1 real multiplication and 2 real divisions for a number of times equal to the total number of points that satisfy (18). In the worst-case scenario, the number of points computed in (18) is equal to the size, M I , of the imaginary constellation diagram composing the QAM constellation symbol. Accordingly, we have M I N t real multiplications and 2M I N t real divisions, and, thus, the complexity of computing the intervals in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">19</ref>) can be upper-bounded by</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">C interval = 2N t + 3M I N t .</formula><p>In summary, the analytical complexity resulting from the computation of the points in the subset Θ R can be upperbounded by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">C ΘR ≤ C QR + C z + C QT 2 ȳ 2 F + C interval<label>(23)</label></formula><p>Since ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) requires 8 real multiplications for each computed Euclidean distance, it follows that the computational complexity of the Tx-SD receiver can be upper-bounded as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">C Tx-SD ≤ C ΘR + 8N r card {Θ R } (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">)</formula><p>where card {•} denotes the cardinality, i.e., the number of points, in a set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. C-SD</head><p>The computational complexity of C-SD follows immediately from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">8</ref>) and (24), as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">C C-SD ≤ C ΘR + 8 ( ,s)∈ΘR Ñr ( , s)<label>(25)</label></formula><p>V. NUMERICAL RESULTS</p><p>In this section, Monte Carlo simulation results for at least 10 6 channel realisation are shown to compare the performance and computational complexity of ML-optimum and SD-based receivers. The numerical examples are obtained by assuming the system model in Section II. Furthermore, the radius R is chosen as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> with ε = 10 -6 .</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the BEP averaged over Rayleigh fading is shown by considering two different constellation sizes, and N t = N r = 4. We notice that all the SDs have the same performance, and all of them overlap with the ML-optimum detector. As expected, the performance of SM improves when M decreases.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the computational complexity C is compared using the derivations provided in the sections IV. In particular, the figures show the relative computational complexity of the SDs with respect to the ML-optimum detector, i.e., C rel (%) = 100 × (C ML -C SD )/C ML . In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we observe that C-SD is always better than Tx-SD, while it is better than Rx-SD only for high SNRs. The reason for this latter result is because of the additional pre-computations required by both C-SD and Tx-SD solutions. As mentioned in Section I, we notice that the Rx-SD scheme is more effective in reducing the complexity when the number of antennas at the receiver is large.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> show an interesting setup where it is clearly highlighted that none of the proposed SDs is superior to the others, and that it depends on the MIMO configuration and the SNR which SD is the best. In particular, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> we notice that when M = 64 the best receiver to use is the C-SD, while if we look at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> when M = 8 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> when M = 32 we notice that the Rx-SD detector is optimum. The reason is that in the former case the transmit search space is large enough to compensate for the pre-computations required by Tx-SD and C-SD receivers. On the contrary, in the latter case the transmit search space is not extensive, and, therefore, there is little to be gained in reducing it, and the fixed amount of pre-computations dominate.</p><p>Finally, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> when M = 64, Rx-SD and C-SD are almost equivalent, as the transmit search space is large and there are many antennas at the receiver creating a large receive search space.</p><p>In summary, we can conclude that Rx-SD is the best choice when the number of antennas at the receiver is large, as it can significantly reduce the receiver search space without any pre-computations. On the other hand, C-SD is the best choice when the transmit search space is very large and the number of antennas at the receiver is low. It is interesting to note that the Tx-SD scheme is never the best choice in the investigated system scenarios. Since this latter decoder is most closely related to conventional SDs for MIMO systems, a main contribution of this paper is that it is required to reduce both, the transmit search space as well as the receive search space to arrive at a significant reduction in receiver complexity while maintaining superior bit-error performance.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have introduced and analysed the performance/complexity trade-off of three SDs for SM. We have shown that the proposed solutions provide a substantial reduction in the computational complexity while retaining the same BEP as the ML-optimum detector. Numerical results have highlighted that no particular SD is strictly superior to the others, and which SD is optimal, depends on the MIMO configuration employed, i.e., the triplet (N t , N r , M) and the SNR at the receiver. Furthermore, Rx-SD is the best choice for large N r , and C-SD is the best option when either N r is low or M is large. In general, the results have shown that specially tailored SD can significantly reduce the receiver complexity of SM without deteriorating its BER performance.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
