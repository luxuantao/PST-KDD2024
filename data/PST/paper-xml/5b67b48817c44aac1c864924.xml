<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Medical care has become an indispensable part of people's lives. Medical data is essential for patient diagnosis and blockchain contains a continuously growing linked list of records, which ensures that a piece of data recorded in a block cannot be tampered with. Its distributed storage mechanism also guarantees that the data will not be lost. Although blockchain is suitable for solving the abovementioned problems, challenges are the storage of large amounts of data in the limited space of blockchain transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and proof that the preserved data have not been tampered with.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based data preservation system (DPS) for medical data that provides a reliable data storage solution that guarantees the stored data will not be tampered with, verifies the validity of data conveniently, and ensures privacy for users. In particular, inspired by the concept of proof of possession of balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we present the concept of proof of primitiveness of data here. That means the characteristics of data will be preserved forever in blockchain, we don't have to worry about data been tampered with, and the system can validate whether current data is identical to the original data or not. First, the actual overall system requirements are determined. Then, we introduce a full-fledged protocol that allows users to store the preservation in the blockchain and prove the primitiveness of the data. Compared to general electronic data preservation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, an important advantage of the proposed DPS is that it addresses the issues of easy loss or tampering of data or farfetched data. Even if the data in the database have been tampered with or damaged, the data can be retrieved and verified through the blockchain. Based on the proposed protocol, the blockchain-based DPS is implemented on the Ethereum platform. The performance evaluation results show that the cost of preservation with the proposed DPS is less than US$2, even if the size of the preserved files is 50 MB.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. "Preliminaries" reviews previously published papers and existing blockchain application systems, including the Ethereum platform. The actual operation of the proposed DPS and contracts are described in detail in "The proposed DPS" and "Algorithm design", respectively. The detailed algorithm processes are illustrated in "System process". Security analysis and performance evaluation are illustrated in "Security analysis" and "Performance evaluation", respectively. "Discussion" discusses the limitations of the DPS. Finally, we conclude the paper in "Conclusion".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminaries</head><p>In this section, we first explain the fundamentals of blockchain and Bitcoin, as well as the reasons for choosing Ethereum as the underlying platform, and then present an overview of existing studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bitcoin and blockchain</head><p>To realize a data preservation system, we resort to blockchain, which is an open and distributed ledger based on peer-topeer networks and consensus algorithms. In particular, we replace the concept proof of possession of balance first proposed in Bitcoin with an equivalent concept, which is referred to as proof of primitiveness of data.</p><p>To implement the DPS effectively, we must ensure that preserved data cannot be tampered with, damaged, or lost. Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization. For an attack to be effective, a hacker must attack all copies in all nodes simultaneously. Blockchain can also prevent malicious tampering with data, as data changes can be found immediately by synchronization nodes in the blockchain network <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In addition, the blockchain's synchronization method and consensus algorithm ensure that every node in the blockchain network can share data and that all copies in synchronous conditions are exactly the same as those of other nodes.</p><p>Bitcoin can be viewed as a distributed database consisting of many nodes in a P2P network. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates an example of a Bitcoin transaction. If A wants to pay two Bitcoins to B, then B needs to specify not only the amount on the transaction sheet but also the source of the two Bitcoins. As each transaction records the previous owner, current owner and the next owner of the funds, the transaction can be traced to the whole process.</p><p>Because each transaction is relatively fragmented, the Bitcoin system created the concept of the block to better account for transactions. The previous block ID is contained in each block to enable identification of its previous node. To avoid false or repeated transactions, it is necessary to construct a Proof of Work (PoW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> system that will enable the new block to be trusted. To modify the transaction information within a block, a user must complete all the work of the block and its subsequent connected blocks, which greatly increases the difficulty of tampering with the data.</p><p>In the real world, every non-cash transaction is recorded by the banking system, and if the banking system collapses, all data are likely to be lost <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In the world of Bitcoin, all transaction records are kept in countless computers around the world. The main blockchain can be fully read as long as there is one computer with a Bitcoin program that works. Such a highly redundant storage architecture makes it very unlikely that the Bitcoin blockchain will be lost completely <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethereum</head><p>Ethereum's core idea is to make the blockchain a programmable distributed credit infrastructure to support smart contract applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Specifically, Ethereum not only uses the blockchain as a decentralized virtual currency and payment platform but also expands the technology of a decentralized market by increasing the expansibility function on the chain. The basic content includes real estate contracts, equity and debt obligations, intellectual property, etc.</p><p>A transaction in Ethereum refers to the signature packet of messages sent from an external account. It contains the receiver of the message, signature of the sender, Ethereum account balance, and data to be sent. The latter two values are called STARTGAS and GASPRICE. To prevent exponential explosion and infinite loops of code, each transaction requires a limit on the computational steps that are caused by the execution of the code, including the initial message and all messages raised in execution. STARTGAS is the limit, and GASPRICE is the cost of every step that needs to be paid to the miners.</p><p>Compared with the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain provides the following three major improvements. This field contains 80 bytes of space and is utilized to write data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The Ethereum block contains a similar structure called payload, which is derived from the smart contract parameter. Users can fill in data in the corresponding field. The payload parameter in Ethereum can record at least 4000 characters, compared to the 80-byte limit in Bitcoin. Note that overlong data will lead to transaction failure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related work</head><p>Medical data warrant preservation because these data deal with life. Loss or tampering of medical data will lead to inconvenience of treatment, resulting in delay treatment progress, even endanger the patient's life.</p><p>Existing sensitive information and medical datamanagement systems are generally based on a group of centralized servers, which build a large site system or centralized relational database system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The system usually adds a series of network and communication devices to ensure the client and core server can achieve normal interactions, which also increases the additional cost and complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The probability of a highly centralized system failure is high. One link failure can lead to the collapse of the entire system. It also increases the likelihood of being hacked. Unpredictable problems to the user are likely if hackers modify a few fields in a database. Some architectures use cloud storage to solve existing data preservation problems. The provable data possession (PDP) scheme is used to verify the integrity of outsourced data without downloading such data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Certificate management and key escrow problems, as well as ensuring privacy protection, are addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. A new storage scheme that divides big data into sequenced parts and stores them among multiple cloud storage service providers to secure data is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, issues of privacy, primariness, and security cannot be solved simultaneously. In particular, third parties should always be considered untrusted. Before data storage space is released or redistributed to other cloud users, it is also uncertain that relevant information will be completely cleared, whether stored in hard disk or in memory, to avoid data residues and leaking of sensitive information. The use of cloud storage also risks the loss of data due to server failure; for example, AWS (Amazon Web Services) had 4 h of downtime on February 28th, 2017, resulting in thousands of websites and applications becoming completely inaccessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>At present, some organizations have started to study using blockchain to store data. T. McConaghy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> released a software called BigchainDB that has blockchain properties (e.g. decentralization, immutability, owner-controlled assets) and database properties (e.g. high transaction rate, low latency, indexing and querying of structured data). E. Gaetani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> delineate the importance of data integrity in cloud computing, then design a blockchain-based database which solves limitations of low throughput, high latency, and weak stability, for cloud computing environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The proposed DPS</head><p>This section presents an overview of the proposed DPS. Our basic idea is to introduce the concept of proof of primitiveness of data and use the unique data structure and de-centralization of blockchain to develop a data preservation system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preservation data analysis</head><p>In the process of diagnosis and treatment, people produce a large amount of medical data, including allergic history, assay data, anamnesis, and so on. Although each person produces various data in the process of diagnosis and treatment, the formats can be divided into type of text and multimedia. The proposed DPS supports rich preservation needs in different environments, different applications and different objects.</p><p>These data are vital for both individuals and doctors. The content must be true and complete when it is produced, and the data must be traceable and resistant to alteration, forgery, or deletion when validated. Because of its unique characteristics, medical data must also be safe and anonymous when stored. Medical data contain sensitive personal information, and thus prevention mechanisms must be established to prevent unconcerned or unauthorized staff from obtaining and extracting information. In addition, the data should be encrypted so that once the data are stolen, they cannot be understood without decryption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System framework</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates a typical data preservation operation flow that includes two programs, namely the data access program and the blockchain interaction program. The first consists of four major operations, i.e., data submission, data manipulation, data query, and data verification. Users submit data for preservation, which is processed by the DPS. Users can query the preserved data and verify primitiveness. In the blockchain interaction program, the system stores unpreserved data in the blockchain and extracts the stored data back to the data access application. Preservation is transmitted to the blockchain network in the form of transactions, which miner nodes package and receive a reward for. The greater the amount of preservation, the larger the reward that miners will receive. Once a block is packaged, the preservation is stored forever in the blockchain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2 Structure of preservation and blockchain interaction</head><p>We consider adding a digital signature to each interaction and verifying it after reception to avoid modification or replacement due to an unreliable Internet. We also assume that each user has a computer or other intelligent device connected to the Internet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Threat model</head><p>There are four main threats to the proposed DPS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data modification or deletion</head><p>In all following possible situations, let us consider that the DPS preserves medical data, which involve diagnosis certificates and medical records. It is easy to tempt criminals to hurt others' body and health deliberately by modifying or deleting some of the data in the database <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In addition, the multimedia data are stored in a server that criminals have the possibility to operate illegally, such as modifying some data in a file or replace the original image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fraud by using false data</head><p>Taking into account the fact that preservation can appear to be a judicial credential, the following unfortunate situation might occur: two doctors perform a preservation operation for the same event but with slightly different or even opposite contents. Medical data can serve as proof of rights or judicial credentials, but if there are two pieces of different or conflicting data, how the proposed DPS identifies the real data is crucial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data interception</head><p>One of the major features of blockchain is transparency, which means that anyone can view the details of the blockchain transactions, including the data that the DPS preserves. Adversaries can obtain all preservations and take advantage of them. For example, Adversaries can know one person's physical characteristics or illness according to medical records, thereby threatening their life security <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>User's privacy</head><p>Any user wallet address <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref> is stored in the DPS, which could be a privacy issue for users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice of blockchain platform</head><p>According to the analysis of blockchain in "Ethereum" and "Related work", we can conclude that there are two disadvantages of Bitcoin as an actual application:</p><p>-Slow confirmation: It takes approximately 10 min for a transaction to be verified by the whole net and approximately 1 h to receive safe confirmation. -Small storage space: Bitcoin files are too small for developers to write data and cannot meet the space requirements needed for massive data.</p><p>Based on the comparison of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we choose to use Ethereum blockchain to implement the DPS. There are many third-party development platforms based on Ethereum blockchain in the Internet. Because the security and development quality of these platforms are unknown, we choose to use the original Ethereum blockchain instead of secondary development bases on other platforms. There are now more than 20,000 nodes [32] linked and synchronized with the original Ethereum, which ensures the security of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design goals</head><p>According to the requirements and threats discussed above, the proposed DPS should meet the following design goals:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ensure the data are consistent with the user local's after submission</head><p>Unpreserved data are stored in the user's computer and need to be transferred to the DPS server. As quality and security cannot be guaranteed during transmission, the data packet may be lost or obtained by others, the contents may be subject to malicious tampering, or transmission failure may occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[33]</ref>. The preservation of these invalid or incorrect contents will not only increase the burden on the system but also cause loss of the user. Therefore, to ensure that the content the user submitted is identical to the content the DPS receives, the system must apply a digital signature algorithm and show the data to the user upon receipt. A careful check and confirmation are needed to avoid the occurrence of invalid preservation and content error. This part solves the "fraud by using false data" threat declared in "Threat model".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prevent data from being tampered, forged or deleted</head><p>During the process of data preservation, users, system managers and notary parties have access to preserved data. Thus, the first task is to ensure that the data are tamperproof. For example, with respect to wrong medical records, the doctors may use all available opportunities to modify the preserved data to avoid punishment by law. As another example, some enemies may take advantage of their job convenience or use large amounts of money to induce system managers to modify real data in the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref>. Some people, to avoid responsibility, may even fabricate data and delete or replace some information in a system with abandon. These actions will seriously hurt others' body and health. Thus, it is necessary to set up a guard mechanism so that data cannot be tampered with or deleted. Even if an illegal situation occurs, the system can thoroughly detect it. This part could address the "data modification or deletion" threat declared in "Threat model".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anonymity and encryption</head><p>The preserved medical data may contain sensitive personal information. Therefore, the data must be anonymized, including the connections between the username and preserved contents, the filename of the stored file and the preserved data, and the username and personal information. In addition, the preserved multimedia data must be stored in the system in the form of files, which inevitably will be accessible to the outside world. To prevent illegal operators from performing unlawful operations, the preserved contents should be encrypted to ensure that readability and operability will be lost without decryption. The key should be properly stored to avoid encryption failure causing by leakage. This part could solve the "data Interception" and "user's privacy" threats declared in "Threat model".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm design</head><p>To satisfy the above requirements, we have implemented two contracts, called PS (Preservation Submission) and PV (Primitiveness Verification). First, the user uploads the text or files that need to be preserved during the PS phase. After confirming that the uploaded content is correct, the content will be stored in the DPS officially and cannot be changed. In the PV phase, the user can view the original content that has been saved or upload new files requiring verification of primitiveness. The DPS detects whether it has been changed and feeds the results back to the user automatically.</p><p>Because preservation in the blockchain entails some cost, the DPS restricts the permissions of user operations strictly; only users who are authenticated and successfully logged in to the DPS can operate on the preserved data. Unlogged users can only browse the already generated blockchain transaction. Because blockchain transactions are anonymized, viewing the transaction profiles and the encrypted contents will not have any impact on the preservation. This also achieves the goal of universal supervision and strengthens the credibility of the DPS.</p><p>Next, the pseudo-code of PS and PM will be presented with details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preservation submission (PS )</head><p>PS is mainly composed of three functions:</p><p>1. Receiving the unpreserved data uploaded by the user and processing it. 2. Encrypting the processed data for protection. 3. Storing the preservation in the blockchain.</p><p>Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo-code for dataProcessing(), which receives the user's uploaded data for preservation and processes it. The DPS can accept data in two formats, a file type or a text type. If the preserved data are of the file type, the system uses the SHA-256 algorithm to calculate the hash r of the file, then processes the file and stores it in randomly generated folders. Data that are text files are stored in the database temporarily, and the hash of the text is calculated by using the SHA-256 algorithm. Finally, the ECC algorithm is used to generate a pair of asymmetric keys that will be used in Algorithms 2 and 4.</p><p>Algorithm 2 shows the pseudo-code of dataProtection(), which encrypts the processed data for protection. This function is invoked when the user verifies the validity of the data to be preserved and will proceed to the next step. If the user confirms the preservation, the DPS uses the AES algorithm to generate a symmetric key K sym to encrypt the unpreserved data. If the data to be preserved are files, the content M that needs to be encrypted is the location index of the file index. Content M can be divided into files M f and text M t , which are encrypted and converted into C f and C t .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C f = AES(K sym , M f ) (1)</formula><p>If it is text type, the content M is the original text.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C t = AES(K sym , M t )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Next, the public key pubKey in the asymmetric key generated in Algorithm 1 is used to encrypt the K sym . Using this multiple encryption strategy provides greater prevention against data leakage. Finally, the function returns the encrypted data. Users can also cancel the preserve operation, and the stored files or data in the database will be deleted.</p><p>Algorithm 3 shows the pseudo-code of writeInBlockchain(), which stores the preservation in the blockchain. First, the user's legitimacy is confirmed based on the user's registration information and past preserve operations and can only be set by the administrator. If the user is legal, the data to be preserved will be stored in the blockchain, and then the transaction hash Tx will be returned. The preserved contents E and implementation methods will be elaborated in "System process". If the user is on the blacklist, the DPS refuses to perform any operation.</p><p>User accounts are generated randomly and automatically when they register, and have nothing to do with user identity. So the input of each transaction is from the user's own account. The output of each transaction is to some accounts automatically generated by the system, which are managed by the system and used for collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primitiveness verification (PV )</head><p>The PV module comprises three main functions.</p><p>1. Viewing the preserved data. 2. Verifying the consistency with the original data. 3. Extracting data from the blockchain. All three of these functions are performed if the data have been preserved and the blockchain transaction hash is recorded.</p><p>Algorithm 4 shows the pseudo-code of checkPreserved-Data(), which views the data that were stored in the blockchain by the DPS. First, the DPS retrieves the stored encrypted data from the blockchain by T x. Then, the private key priKey, which is the asymmetric key generated in Algorithm 1, is used to decrypt the data C.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M = AES(ECC(priKey, En K ), C) (3)</formula><p>Next, the stored hash r , which is the hash of the original data, is obtained, and the SHA-256 algorithm is used to calculate the hash c of the decrypted preserved files.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">hash c = SHA 256 (M) (4)</formula><p>If hash r is consistent with hash c , the stored file is not modified, and the decrypted preservation is returned. Otherwise, null is returned. The methods of data extraction in Algorithms 4 and 5 will be elaborated in Algorithm 6.</p><p>Algorithm 5 shows the pseudo-code of validatePre-servedData(), which receives the data uploaded by the user and checks whether the data are identical with the preservation. Users upload the data that need to be verified to the DPS, which uses the SHA-256 algorithm to calculate the hash c .</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">hash c = SHA 256 (U ) (5)</formula><p>Next, the data stored in the blockchain are obtained from T x, which contains the hash of the original datahash r , and proofread with hash c . If they are consistent, the data to be verified are identical to the data preserved, and true is returned. Otherwise, the validated data have been modified, and false is returned.</p><p>Algorithm 6 shows the pseudo-code of getChainData(), which extracts and recodes data stored in the blockchain. If T x is valid and exists, the DPS obtains the whole information of the transaction and extracts the data that were preserved previously. The data are then recoded, parsed into the original format, and returned. Otherwise, null is returned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System process</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> illustrates the detailed system model of the proposed DPS. Two master procedures of preservation are identified. The first procedure commits unpreserved data when the user wants to secure the new data. The second procedure identifies the primitiveness of the data, which is divided into two main categories: the first is to view the data that have been preserved, and the second is to submit the data that need to be verified and check whether they are consistent with the content of the security. Each procedure involves an Ethereum blockchain operation, and thus each user has a wallet application operating on personal computers or smart phones. Next, the detailed process of each procedure will be presented. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data submission procedure</head><p>In the data submission procedure, the following four operational steps are executed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data submission and processing</head><p>The legitimate users detected by the DPS can submit data that they want to preserve, which can be either text or multimedia. Invoke the dataProcessing() procedure to save the multimedia data in a randomly generated folder or store the text in the database temporarily based on the type of data. Then generate a hash of data hash r . To prevent the direct view of the content of multimedia data from being stolen, the DPS splits files into files of 1MB each and randomly scatters the files to different folders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data validation</head><p>Feedback on the user's uploaded data is provided, and a hash is generated as confirmation. This step ensures the accuracy of the data because the data can be lost or tampered with or fail to transfer in the communication process when transmitted over the Internet. Next, the dataProtection() program is invoked; the specific algorithm flow is shown in detail in Algorithm 2 in "Preservation submission (PS)". The asymmetric encryption algorithm uses Elliptic Curves Cryptography (ECC). The generated private key priKey will be processed and sent to the user's designated mailbox so that the user can decrypt and view the security content in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data storage</head><p>The writeInBlockchain() program is invoked to write the data that need to be preserved in the blockchain. Because the size of the field that can be written in the Ethereum blockchain is limited, the contents cannot be written intactly, and the storage mode and content are determined according to the type of preservation. On the one hand, if the data that need to be preserved are text type, the hash r and encrypted text C t will be combined to E and then written in the blockchain directly.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E =&lt; hash r , C t &gt; (6)</formula><p>On the other hand, if the data are multimedia files, along with the hash r , the encrypted index of the file location will be stored in the blockchain. Because the data are split into multiple files, there are multiple file location indexes, which are respectively encrypted. The indexes are then arranged in order and stored in the blockchain.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M f =&lt; index i &gt; (i = 1 → n, n = files amount) (7) E =&lt; hash r , C f &gt; (8)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cancel to preservation</head><p>The user can cancel the preserve operation at any time, and the text or file stored temporarily will be deleted. If a user has an unexpected operation, such as closing off the client or killing the process, the DPS automatically deletes any unpreserved text or file that has been stored temporarily for more than an hour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primitiveness identification procedure</head><p>There are two types of authentication methods in the primitiveness identification procedure, which will be described respectively in detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acquisition of preservation content</head><p>The user can directly view the contents of a previous preservation, which requires the user to provide the private key priKey generated when the data were preserved. First, the getChainData() program is executed to extract the data from the blockchain and parse the stored hash s and the encrypted preservation. Next, use priKey to decrypt the data to obtain the stored text or file location index. On one hand, the text is directly obtained from the blockchain, and thus the absence of tampering can be confirmed and displayed directly to the user. On the other hand, a multimedia file requires the reassembly of the stored files based on the location index, followed by the calculation of the hash c . If hash s is consistent with hash c , the contents of the file saved in the DPS have not been tampered with and can be displayed to the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verify consistency</head><p>Users can verify whether the existing data are exactly identical to the preserved data. The user uploads the file that needs to be validated. Then, the DPS invokes the validatePreservedData() program to calculate the hash c and extract the data from the blockchain and parses the stored hash r , which is compared to the hash c of the data to be validated. If the program returns True, the data are completely consistent, and the file uploaded by the user has not been modified. Otherwise, the DPS will warn users that the data are not exactly the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Security analysis</head><p>In this section, we prove the security of our protocols through the following theorems. Each theorem corresponds to one threat model in "Choice of blockchain platform".</p><p>Theorem 1 Suppose adversaries can access the preserved data or files stored in the data server by other users. However, he/she cannot modify or delete the preservation and cannot view the saved files, and users will know if the files are destroyed. Thus, the data can be safely preserved.</p><p>Proof The uploaded data M are actually stored in the blockchain, whose characteristics ensure that the preservation cannot be modified and that blockchain transactions cannot be deleted once confirmed. If an adversary wants to launch an attack to modify the data in the blockchain, extensive work is required to construct a new main chain, which is nearly impossible. In addition, all multimedia files M f are stored in random locations with irregular filenames after being split, and the indexes of the file locations are encrypted and stored in the blockchain. In this case, it is almost impossible for lawbreakers to recover and view the contents of the original files. Furthermore, if the file is tampered with as M f , it can be verified by comparison with the hash r preserved in the blockchain. Then, the user can use the second method described in "Primitiveness identification procedure" to verify the primitiveness of the data, knowing M f = M f accordingly.</p><p>Theorem 2 Suppose adversaries attempt to preserve a piece of data that is different from the existing data to cover the real content. However, early data always exist and are more legally effective, and thus adversaries cannot use false data to defraud.</p><p>Proof When there are two opposing security data, M and M , in general, the solution is to introduce a judicial system to adjudicate by obtaining evidence. However, our DPS does not deal with judicial evidence because it is out of the scope in terms of primitiveness proof. Actually, we encourage the preservation of data as early as possible because each security has a timestamp field that shows the time of preservation in the blockchain. As described in "Primitiveness identification procedure", we can learn the truth by viewing the raw data that were initially preserved.</p><p>We advocate that users upload data that must be validated or are considered suspicious as the DPS can make more accurate judgments. Generally, we believe that data that have been preserved earlier are more legally effective. That is to say, if time M &lt; time M , M is legal.</p><p>Theorem 3 Suppose adversaries can pinpoint all blockchain transactions produced by the DPS and read the data. If he/she cannot understand the encrypted data, the adversaries will not be able to steal users' sensitive data.</p><p>Proof As described in "Algorithm design", all data are encrypted and then stored, and thus no one can see the real contents of the preservation as long as the user protects his/her private key. In addition, because of the characteristic anonymity of the blockchain <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35]</ref>, all transactions are sent by an Ethereum address, which is independent of the user's personal information and cannot relate the preservation data to the individual. This demonstrates the anonymity of the DPS.</p><p>Theorem 4 Suppose adversaries can obtain all blockchain addresses of all users stored in the DPS. If the address is generated randomly and is not related to the user's operation, the user's privacy will not be threatened.</p><p>Proof All blockchain addresses were originally public to the whole network because they were designed to be used to receive transactions. All transactions are automatically sent by the wallet application of Ethereum, and only users can send a transaction with their private key; consequently, users do not have to take any precautions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance evaluation</head><p>We evaluate the proposed DPS in terms of its operational cost. In particular, the total cost is equivalently estimated by measuring the total Gas, which can only be spent on one function involved in the progress, that is, storing the preservation in the blockchain (writeInBlockchain()). In other words, the cost will be generated only when the data are preserved and not when the data are verified. The amount of Gas will be determined when an Ethereum transaction is produced, e.g., a balance operation costs 20 Gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the parameters of the computer used in this evaluation. In particular, we use an original implementation of the Ethereum protocol, geth <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref>, to send a transaction or deploy a contract since this tool is easy to operate and has the ability to automatically count the Gas amount. In the end, the total Gas amount is converted in  USD by referring to the exchange rate chart coinbase <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref> and myetherwallet <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>. At the time of evaluation, the rate was 1 Gas = 2 × 10 -8 ETH = 1.642 × 10 -6 USD.</p><p>A basic transaction requires 21,000 Gas. For every 100 bytes text or 10MB file added, it costs about 5400Gas. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows the total cost, in USD, to save data against the size of preservation. Because the length of the preserved data determines the Gas cost, the cost increases as the size of preservation increases. However, the obtained results shown in the chart illustrate that the total cost remains very low; even if the size of the multimedia file increases to 50 MB or the number of words increases to 500bytes, the total cost is less than US$2. It is important to note that this cost and the actual value of the preservation data are completely unrelated. Obviously, the proposed DPS is more applicable to relatively valuable data. In particular, in the proposed DPS, the multimedia data are split to store each 1 MB as a file, and the data are stored in the blockchain as is the location index, thus avoiding cost explosion due to the storage of large amounts of data. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows the concurrency performance for different preservation types and sizes. The figure illustrates that when the number of concurrent preservations exceeds 350, the response time will increase rapidly. In addition, the performance is related to the type of storage content; the file type is generally longer than the text type due to the division and storage operation of the file. The 500 bytes text and 50 MB multimedia files in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> are not the upper limit of storage capacity. In theory, the system can store files of unlimited size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The proposed DPS has a number of advantages compared to previous data preservation systems. The first is that it can effectively resist data tampering or deletion operations. The DPS can detect illegal operations of the data and notify users in time. This is very important because we use the blockchain technique, whose untampered features have been confirmed by many proofs. The second advantage is the anonymity of the DPS. We use a variety of cryptographic algorithms and file storage schemes to prevent the sensitive data stored by users from being leaked or stolen by illegal elements. Compared to cloud storage, the DPS implements permanent storage and untampering of data. At the same time, we avoid binding user identity information with medical information to reduce the possibility of privacy disclosure.</p><p>However, the current system still needs to be improved. There are some limitations to the proposed DPS. The first is related to the optimization of the structure of the data stored in the blockchain. Currently, when the DPS writes preservation data in the blockchain, each transaction contains only one security content. If the amount of data stored is small, some usable space will be wasted. A better data structure and algorithm can be designed to write a number of different preservations in the blockchain each time in a feasible range of time and space to implement high concurrency.</p><p>The second limitation is related to image content recognition. The preserved multimedia data might be images. Let us consider the following possible situation: When an user executes the primitiveness verification program, the contents of the uploaded image are exactly the same in reality. However, the DPS mistakenly assumes that the data are tampered with because the image is compressed or re-shot so that the coding is inconsistent with the original one. Therefore, we should consider combining artificial intelligence and image content recognition techniques with the DPS to extract the core information to avoid the above "fake tampering" situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present a novel data preservation system (DPS) for medical data. This DPS provides a reliable storage solution to ensure the primitiveness and verifiability of stored data while preserving users' privacy. After illustrating the actual overall system requirements, we introduced a full-fledged protocol that allows users to store the preservation in the blockchain and to prove the primitiveness of the data. Compared to general electronic data preservation systems, an important advantage of the proposed DPS is that it can deal with situations in which data are easily lost and tampered with. Even if the data in the database have been tampered with or damaged, the data can be retrieved and verified through the blockchain. The protocol validation demonstrated the validity of our DPS. Based on the proposed protocol, the blockchainbased DPS was implemented on the Ethereum platform. The performance evaluation results showed that the cost of preservation with the proposed DPS is less than US$2, even if the size of the preserved files is 50 MB. When the number of concurrent preservations is 400 and all files are 30 MB, the response time of the system is not more than 1 s.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 An example of Bitcoin transactions between address A, B, C, D, E, F and G</figDesc><graphic coords="3,51.12,60.47,492.76,185.32" type="bitmap" /></figure>
