<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We determine the factors that affect the probability of collision and quantify them.</p><p>•The proposed method of building BP neural network can simulate the numerical expression of computational intelligence.</p><p>•The dynamic optimization methods for each network parameter and the trained network to estimate collision probability are employed.</p><p>Abstract: Recently, the deep learning schemes have been well investigated for improving the driving safety and efficiency in the transportation systems. In this paper, a probabilistic model named as CPGN (Collision Prediction model based on GA-optimized Neural Network) for decision-making in the rear-end collision avoidance system is proposed, targeting modeling the impact of important influential factors of collisions on the occurring probability of possible accidents in the Internet of Vehicles (IoT). The decision on how to serve the chauffeur is determined by a typical deep learning model, i.e., the BP neural network through evaluating the possible collision risk with V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communication, V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication and GPS infrastructure supporting. The proper structure of our BP neural network model is deeply learned with training data generated from VISSIM with multiple influential factors considered. In addition, since the selection of the connection coefficient array and thresholds of the neural network has great randomness, a local optimization issue is readily occurring during the modeling procedure. To overcome this problem and consider the ability to efficiently find out a global optimization, this paper chooses the genetic algorithm to optimize the coefficient array and thresholds of proposed neural network.</p><p>For the purpose of enhancing the convergence speed of the proposed model, we further adjust the studying rate according to the relationship between the actual and predicated values of two adjacent iterations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>With the current rapid economic growth, the population of vehicles is fast increasing, accompanied by a rising number of road accidents. Investigations and statistical data show that among all of the road accidents, those that involve vehicles account for 60-70% of the total and are dominated by real-end collisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These accidents concentrate in places where the vehicles could drive very fast and/or the external environment nearby is dull, such as on highways <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Hence, how to considerably reduce rear-end collisions, especially on highways, is essential for the driving safety of vehicles.</p><p>The Internet of Things (IoT), as the name implies, "things connected to the Internet", is an important aspect of the new generation of information technology. It has two meanings: first, the IoT is an extension and expansion of the network whose core and foundation is still the Internet. Second, the extension and expansion of the IoT can achieve the intelligent *Manuscript Click here to view linked References identification of goods, positioning, tracking, monitoring and management of a network based on information exchange and communication between any two items <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. As a special case of the IoT, the IoV is quickly developing from a series of sensing technologies that offer information to chauffeurs and upload the filtered sensor data to centralized processing equipment to define performance metric functions and optimize them through exchanging sensor inputs among vehicles. In the autopilot system, these functions can achieve the maximum safety and efficiency of vehicles and reduce the environmental impact. In other words, the introduction of the IoT will definitely improve the road safety with advanced sensor technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, expanded environmental awareness and timely information exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>At present, the techniques that serve to ensure road safety can be mainly classified into passive safety and active safety. The former class attempts to alleviate harm against the drivers after the occurrence of accidents, which cannot avoid potential accidents in advance in most cases. To avoid road accidents before they occur, active safety techniques are receiving increasing attention from the experts and researchers. This research focuses on active safety techniques by mainly studying the methods for risk-aware safety alerts and interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and automatic controls for the protection of people inside of vehicles in the cases of emergency <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The active safety technique that centers on collision warnings anticipates potential risks and actively informs the chauffeurs and passengers of oncoming dangers.</p><p>According to the benefits of an active safety system, the active safety early warning technique that collaboratively combines wireless communication, vehicular sensing and GPS localization techniques has become a hot topic in the IoT.</p><p>The key to the early warning of dangers against a vehicle is to identify the potential safety hazards and the corresponding levels of risk. In fact, many studies have been conducted in the area of safety warning skills over the past few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Among these studies, the context-aware scheme for vehicular collision forecasting based on the deep learning of the internal/external environment is of great significance; this system mainly consists of the sensing layer, inference layer and application layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The sensing layer is responsible for the perception of information with regard to the environment, road, drivers and statuses of vehicles using wireless communication and proximity sensing techniques. The inference layer is mainly responsible for studying and deciding the present motion states of vehicles based on the messages collected at the sensing layer and then executing the corresponding actuators. The principle task of the application layer is to send the current state of a vehicle to other vehicles nearby. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a dangerous context-aware system in the vehicular environment was proposed. In this system, various sensors are first used to obtain the status of the vehicles. Next, information is chosen based on a fuzzy logic model from the sensed information with regard to the vehicles' status as the decision information, which is then applied to determine whether the vehicle is truly in danger. Afterward, an alert will be issued to the driver if the vehicle is really endangered. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Aswad et al. proposed an environment-aware driving assistant system on the highway. In their system, the status of the vehicles and the nearby environment is first obtained with sensors. Afterward, the obtained status of the vehicle is compared with the expert database for risk evaluation. Finally, guidance is offered to the driver according to the matched pattern from the expert database. As a result, a vehicle that is in extreme danger will be subjected to an automatic control; if the vehicle is in a common danger, an audio/video alert will be issued to the driver, and if the vehicle is truly safe, then no information will be passed to the driver and vehicles. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Al-Sultan et al. presented a context-aware system to discover the abnormal activities of a driver. When the system detects fatigue or drunk driving, it will issue warnings and inform the driver with regard to driving safety. This system will first sense the surroundings of the chauffeur and then perform analysis of the obtained information using the dynamic Bayesian network model to evaluate the activities of the driver. If the activities of the chauffeur are found to be abnormal, then warnings will be issued to the driver. Otherwise, the driver can continue driving normally. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Woermdl et al. presented a context-aware system design that consists of a physical sensing component, an inferential decision component and a vehicular execution component. The physical sensing component is responsible for collecting the data sensed by different sensors and delivering the collected data to the inferential decision layer. Afterward, the inferential decision layer will infer the status of the investigated vehicle based on the dynamic Bayesian network model and send the result to the vehicular execution component. The vehicular execution component is designed to execute the corresponding actions according to the status of the vehicle delivered by the inferential decision layer.</p><p>Despite their ability to improve the driving safety, the aforementioned studies consider only one or a few factors with respect to the vehicle itself, other vehicles, the driving environment and the driver. In addition, the forecasting accuracy of above proposals is still not sufficient. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a risk forecasting scheme that can predict the level of risk against the vehicles by jointly accounting for multiple factors that involve the vehicle itself, other vehicles, the driving environment and the driver. In the proposed system, the sensed data are fed into a Back-Propagation (BP) neural network for inferencing, and the decision results are used for further control over the vehicle.</p><p>In summary, the point of our study is to focus on the active safety-related warning techniques in the IoT based on deep learning models. To ensure the driving safety and improve the driving experience, this paper proposes a BP neural network-based collision probability forecasting scheme that jointly considers the effects of multiple influencing factors that involve the drivers, the environment, the vehicles and the road. Moreover, different levels of warnings can be issued to the driver based on the extent of the predicted risk to the vehicle.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related studies on active safety systems. Section 3 describes the design principle of our proposed GA-optimized BP neural network, which is used for forecasting the collision probability while accounting for multiple collision-influencing factors. Section 4 demonstrates the utility of our raised model with simulations and the corresponding numerical results. Section 5 summarizes the content of this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>The passive safety systems, for example, safety belts, body steel frame structure, airbags and other safety configurations, are indeed helpful for obtaining a safer driving environment in our daily life. In addition to passive safety agencies that effectively reduce personal injuries in an accident, active safety systems can remind and help the driver to prevent or mitigate crashes before accidents through an electronic stability system, warning system, Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) and so on. In recent years, significant work has been done to characterize algorithms and investigate hardware implementations for active safety systems. Although researchers have conducted a large number of experiments and obtained quite satisfactory results, they have not attempted to incorporate multiple influential factors, including subjective and objective factors, into the forecasting and control of possible collisions.</p><p>In general, active safety systems can be classified into three categories according to the following criteria: data collection or processing methods, safety state studying/determining schemes and active control maneuvers.</p><p>Upon data collection or processing, active safety systems could be designed with an on-board vision camera, inter-vehicle communication (IVC) transceivers, motion capture sensors and so forth. Vicente Milanés et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed a TTC estimation model that monitors vision-based data, and the corresponding safety actions are then performed through fuzzy-logic control to avoid collisions with pedestrians. This autonomous driving system depends on the video information to measure and calculate the vehicle-pedestrian distance, and it can work in parallel with a human driver to perform automatic pedestrian avoidance maneuvers that involve braking actions. Methods such as computer vision and the available filter designs are also proposed to help the driver in detecting the movements in the surrounding areas relevant to the vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, recognizing lanes and road borders <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and even monitoring other drivers' attentiveness to forecast their intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast with vision-based driving assistant systems, IVC has attracted more research concern from vehicle producers, investigators, scholars, guidelines makers and individuals, regarding building safer driving circumstances based on information exchange between vehicles. As an extension of the IEEE 802.11 protocol standard, IEEE 802.11p transceivers have been designed mainly to solve the problem from fast and frequent handoffs and other safety-related issues to avoid delay expansion and packet losses. D Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> first provided a general picture of DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communications)-based vehicular communications and discussed the requirements of the IVC for safety-related applications. M Sepulcre et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> established a testbed to calculate the effectiveness of active safety systems under difficult conditions through cooperation communication between vehicles. They also revealed the potential limitations of cooperative active safety applications and discussed possible countermeasures to overcome the performance degradation that occurs in critical environments.</p><p>Although different data collection and process schemes have been proposed before to address the active safety issues, the essentials of such systems lie in the pursuit of a general solution that could consider multiple influential factors and their impact on safety applications when combined together.</p><p>Since a smart active safety control system comes from accurate state determinations, a considerable amount of research that focuses on this field has been proposed. In general, these studies could further be classified into two categories: the time-to-collision (TTC) and distance-to-collision (DTC) scales. The hypothesis of TTC analysis is usually a decision threshold regarding the active safety system's activation or behavior change, which is often designed with threshold TTC T </p><p>. A.</p><p>Berthelot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed an algorithm to forecast the probability distribution of TTC as introduced by an uncertain system input from inaccurate predication or sensor measurements. Felipe Jiménez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed an estimation of the TTC between two vehicles colliding at a constant speed along a straight path. This work could also be easily generalized to a complicated case such as curved paths and non-uniform vehicle distributions. In DTC studies, the research interests are more concentrated than for TTC, such as DTC models that consider the driving comfortableness <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, DTC algorithms that regard the driver's characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and the time-head-way DTC scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We also proposed a critical safety distance (CSD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> estimation scheme before making the vehicles more safe and the traffic more efficient through IVC. According to the above studies, it can be concluded that vehicular state estimation is essential to the design of an active safety system, but how to effectively incorporate an estimation into the active control loop and improve the estimation's accuracy from multi-source sensor data still remain important and open issues.</p><p>In fact, the key role that an active safety system plays is prompting drivers on whether to directly intervene in the control of the endangered vehicles to make them safe. Therefore, control maneuver-based topics have attracted a remarkable amount of research interest. Usually, a vehicle control system comprises three layers, for example, a functions definition layer, a supervisory controller layer and a slave controller layer. The role of the functions definition layer is to determine the ongoing control actions according to the collected sensor data. The studies associated with this layer are the assistant driving model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and the automatic pilot model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. For the supervisory and slave controller design, most of the previous studies intended to use artificial intelligence skills to solve complicated open or close loop control problems, such as fuzzy logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, PID controllers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and back-stepping <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Although different active control strategies have been presented to avoid the occurrences of collisions, few studies have attempted to combine the active control issue with the online collision probability estimation to make the control maneuvers wise and adaptive.</p><p>Among the contemporary schemes of active safety systems, ITS (intelligent transportation system) data fusion (DF) and their corresponding applications on driving safety improvement appear more likely to be a general solution in the future. In fact, when building a complex system model, the use of DF technology is often necessary to increase the robustness and fault detection ability of the perception system while employing different sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Currently, DF plays an increasingly important role in transportation systems and is especially associated with safety-related applications such as automatic accident detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and advanced driver assistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Ivan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> developed an automatic incident detection model using monitored information from two different sources -fixed detectors, such as inductive loops, and specially equipped vehicles -to report the propagation time of the link. The neural network model was discussed, and two different approaches are proposed in their work. The first method determined whether an accident has occurred by observing the traffic. In the second method, each data source processed the aggregated data through corresponding algorithms and then output the results through a neural network. In fact, the ideas behind the above works are similar to ours, where combined sensor data are processed together to determine the probability of the occurrence of possible accidents.</p><p>The use of a causal probabilistic model has also been proposed in traffic accident forecasting. Juan de Oñaet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> established an accident forecasting model by calculating the probability of vehicular collisions through the Bayesian network. Peter T. Savolainen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> built a Bayesian network to evaluate traffic accidents and compared the impact of some important causes, such as the environment, vehicles, and pedestrians, on the traffic accident duration. Some researchers used a Bayesian decision tree classification method to study the durations of the traffic accidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In their studies, the accident probability when cars are approaching an intersection can be inferred with a Bayesian network, while accounting for the traffic rules, the digital street map and the sensors' uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>In fact, the above ideas are somewhat similar to ours, which uses a BP neural network to determine the probability of the occurrence of accidents. In practice, it is often difficult to obtain the precise mathematical model of the vehicle dynamics. At the same time, the process of vehicle driving complies with certain laws and is not chaotic. As a result, the car following rules that correspond to the neural network can only be learned through a large amount of training in our work. Fortunately, unlike other rule-based approaches for risk modeling, e.g., approximate reasoning approaches, the BP neural network is capable of replicating the essential features of plausible reasoning in a consistent, efficient, and mathematically sound way. Thus, we select the BP neural network to model the car-following case and predict the risk of rear-end collisions in our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Proposed CPGN model</head><p>In this section, our proposed CPGN (collision prediction model based on a GA-optimized neural network) model will be given in detail. For simplicity, the notations used in our paper are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. In fact, many studies have been proposed on vehicular collision forecasting using deep learning (DL) methods. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> lists some categories and approaches with regard to DL techniques being used for accident forecasting. Usually, these techniques can be further categorized into search heuristics, supervised studying, dimensionality reduction, hybrid approaches and statistical studying. Our work can be classified into a combination of search heuristics and supervised studying. Next, we will first describe the framework of our model and then discuss the details of our algorithm's design.  Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> provides the framework of our proposed model. First, after extensive investigations in some of the relevant literature, we construct a database of factors that influence the vehicular collisions and analyze the correlations between these factors using DPS (data processing system) software <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Afterward, the six factors that are most correlated with the collisions are chosen to transform the generated traffic into metrics used for training purposes. Note that the VISSIM software is employed to simulate the rear-end collisions according to the Wiedemann-99 car following model and to generate the corresponding traffic data for training the neural network. Afterward, the BP neural network is constructed to predict rear-end collisions.</p><p>First, the coefficient array of the links and the choice of the thresholds in the BP neural network are initialized randomly in such a way that the training results of our BP neural network are prone to finding local optima. Next, considering the global optimization capabilities of the generic algorithm (GA), the initialized coefficient array of the links and the choices of the thresholds in the BP neural network are then optimized by the GA. Finally, the Internet of Vehicles is used for the collection and transmission of vehicular information. The collected real-time information is fed to the trained BP neural network to forecast the collision probability for the next monitored interval and to issue an alert to the other vehicles based on the predicted collision probability. Furthermore, we also introduced a mechanism to improve the learning rate to accelerate the convergence of the BP neural network.</p><p>Next, we describe our forecasting model with respect to the following three modules. 1) Generate and initialize a new feed-forward neural network (see section 3.2).</p><p>2) Train the BP neural network (see section 3.3).</p><p>3) Evaluate the BP neural network with numerical results (see chapter 4). The pseudo code for constructing our BP neural network is listed in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1. BP neural network</head><p>1: Parameters: hidden layer number, hidden layer size, learning rate.</p><p>2: Each weight coefficient is initialized at random. 8: Stops updating when the maximum number of iterations has been reached.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Structure of the GA-optimized BP neural network</head><p>The Internet of Vehicles is an extension of the Internet of Things in intelligent transport systems. It relies on the in-vehicle network, the inter-vehicle network and the Internet of Vehicles. By achieving vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-Internet communications according to specified protocols and data dissemination criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, the IoV integrates intelligent transport management, intelligent vehicular control and dynamic delivery of intelligent information into a single network. An important information service of the IoV is to issue the alert to drivers when there is an emergency. To do so, each node in the IoV is equipped with a microprocessor and attached to a road-side unit (RSU). The RSU collects the traffic data from the vehicles connected to each other and is combined together with the controller of the BP neural network to warn the vehicle to take safety measures if necessary.</p><p>In our work, the vehicular collision probability is predicted based on three outputs of the neural network, i.e., collision-free probability, slight collision probability and severe collision probability. To address the problem that a BP neural network is prone to finding local optima, the generic algorithm is then used to optimize the structural parameters of the BP neural network. The details for constructing the BP neural network are given as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Construct the BP neural network for collision probability forecasting 1) Determine the number of layers</head><p>Studies have demonstrated that both three-layer and four-layer neural networks can achieve accurate forecasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Hence, in our work, the three-layer BP neural network is adopted considering its lower complexity compared with the four-layer network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Determine the number of input nodes</head><p>The input nodes of our BP neural network consist of the collision-influencing factors. As mentioned before, our neural network has six input nodes, which correspond to the road type, chauffeur, inter-vehicle distance, speed, road environment and braking capability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Determine the number of output nodes</head><p>The proposed BP neural network has three output nodes, which correspond to the severe collision probability, slight collision probability and collision-free probability. A severe collision refers to an accident that causes at least one death or one serious injury, while a slight collision is defined as an accident that causes at least one slight injury but no death and serious injury. On the other hand, the collision-free scenario means that the vehicles are safe from collisions. 4) Determine the number of nodes at the hidden layer Cybenko has proven that for a network with a single hidden layer, if the hidden layer has sufficient nodes, then the network can approach any mapping with any accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. However, too many nodes will lead to a complex network design and long training time. Accordingly, in our paper, we establish a rule to dynamically adjust the number of nodes at the hidden layer in which the accuracy and complexity are both considered.</p><p>First, to ensure the forecasting accuracy, the deviation of the network's output from the actual value generated from VISSIM is minimized.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Population initialization</head><p>First, randomly generate N data in the range [-0.5, 0.5] as the primary coefficient arrays and thresholds of the BP neural network. These N data comprise the initial population of the GA. Here, for simplicity, we set N to 40. Then, the initial population can be represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">  12 , , , N X M M M  , (3)   1 2<label>3 4</label></formula><p>, , ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">i i i i i M M M M M  , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where X is the population, i M is the th i individual in a population, and ij M is the th j parameter of the individual i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Coding</head><p>The coefficient arrays and thresholds of the BP neural network are regarded as the parameters ready for optimization by the GA. Next, let us encode the coefficient arrays and thresholds between the input and hidden layers as well as between the hidden and output layers. By <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, it can be concluded that the float-encoded genetic algorithm has the higher accuracy and efficiency. Hence, we also adopt floating encoding in our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Fitness function</head><p>In the GA, the value of the fitness function describes how well an individual is. The selection of the next generation in GA also relies on the value of the fitness function. Let us express the fitness function of each individual in the population as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">  i fitness f M  ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where () f is defined according to the expression in Algorithm 2.</p><p>With the objective function indicated by Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), where a small E is desirable, we must convert the objective function to the fitness function while considering that the GA expects the individual to have a higher fitness. Here, the reciprocal of E is defined as the fitness function, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">1 f E  . (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>To avoid growing very large individual fitness and changing the direction of the evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, we make the fitness function have a linear transformation, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">    ' min max min ff ff f    ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where f represents the original fitness function, min f denotes the smallest fitness function, max f is the largest fitness function, and ' f is the transformed fitness function. Finally, the transformed fitness function is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">  '' ' 1 1 f a a f E      , (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where a means the harmonic coefficient with the value 01 a  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Selection, crossover and mutation among individuals (1) Selection</head><p>The selection operation is based on the fitness evaluations of the individuals. A high fitness function of an individual means that it is more possible for its gene to pass on to the next generation, and vice versa. The probability for an individual to be selected can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">    1 1, 2, , i i N k k fM P i N fM    ， . (9)</formula><p>Correspondingly, the cumulative probability of an individual to be selected for the next generation can be expressed as (2) Crossover</p><p>In our work, the arithmetic crossover scheme is used based on the linear interpolation algorithm. Any two individuals with an initialized coefficient array and encoded threshold will be selected from the population for crossover. After the crossover, we have the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">  ' 1 1* 2* 1 X X X     ,<label>(11) </label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20"> ' 2 1* 1 2* X X X     ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where ' 1 X and ' 2 X denote the children, and 1 X and 2 X denote the parents. Here,  is a parameter in the range [0, 1], which can be a constant or an evolution-dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(3) Mutation</head><p>The non-uniform mutation scheme is employed in our work. If the individual k x is chosen from generation X for mutation, then the next generation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">  ' 1 , , , kn X x x x </formula><p>, where , k x is randomly chosen from the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">  ' , U k k k k x x t x x     ,<label>(13) </label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23"> ' , L k k k k x x t x x     ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where   G is the maximum number of generations, and b is a parameter that describes the level of non-uniformity [48] .</p><p>Next, let us determine whether the number of iterations reaches the maximum number G , where 1000 G  in our work. If so, select the most fit individuals from the population and decode them. As a result, the values obtained via decoding are used as the initial values of the link coefficient array and the threshold of the BP network.</p><p>After the parameters have been optimized by the GA, the BP neural network can be trained to determine an appropriate structure. Next, the objective function E can be calculated based on Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), and we can check whether the error accuracy meets the predefined standard. If so, we terminate the training. Otherwise, we update the coefficient arrays and thresholds of the network through training. In fact, for the gradient descent method, the correction to the vector of coefficient arrays is proportional to the gradient of the collision probability error function E at the current location. Therefore, for the th i input node and the th j output node, we have the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">    , , E w i j w i j       ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where   , w i j  denotes the corrected coefficient array of the BP neural network,  is a constant, E is the collision probability error function, and   , w i j means the coefficient array function of the BP neural network.</p><p>Similarly, for the threshold, we have the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">  , j j E b i j b    ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">  , j b i j </formula><p>is the corrected threshold of the BP neural network, E denotes the collision probability error function, and j b is the threshold function of the BP neural network.</p></div>

After determining the system structure, we preprocess the training samples for the BP neural network</p><p>In the practical road environment, there are so many collision-influencing factors that it is too complicated to forecast the vehicular collisions by accounting for all of those factors. Inspired by the discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we construct a database of the collision-influencing factors, which are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. To decrease the complexity of modeling the BP neural network, we place the chauffeur's driving experience, gender and age under the umbrella term "chauffeur-specific factor", and we place the weather, road surface, illumination and traffic under the umbrella term "environmental factor" <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Next, the correlation analysis is performed on the collision factors using DPS, with the results shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Here, the six factors that are most correlated with the collision probability are chosen as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> indicates. The definition of these factors and their value range will be given later. In this paper, some parameters, such as environmental conditions and road surface conditions, transient inter-vehicle distances, and the probability of rear-end collisions, are quantified according to some references, which will be given later, or by common sense. In fact, since a neural network could handle the decision making and case-based reasoning problems with continuous or discrete states, we then discretize the related variables that influence the rear-end collisions, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Note that some parameters have units such as the inter-vehicle distance, whereas other indexes, e.g., environmental conditions and driveway type, cannot be given a unit since they are category-based.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> presents some samples that were used to train the BP neural network. As mentioned above, these samples are generated by VISSIM using the Wiedemann-99 car following model. The factors chosen in this paper are the most influential on vehicular collision, and they encompass the road or driveway type (A), driver statuses (B), environment conditions (C), braking intervention (D), vehicle velocity (E), and inter-vehicle distance (F). In this way, the safety of the road traffic can be effectively represented by the vehicular collision probability that covers the scenarios of no collision, slight collision and severe collision, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Considering that all of the factors are continuous variables, the vehicular collision probability can be expressed as</p></div>

Train the network after fixing the parameters of the BP neural network</head><p>The objective for training the BP neural network is to correct the errors of the coefficient array and the threshold in the negative gradient direction, which displays fast descent of the representation function.

In the incremental mode, the gradient is computed, and the coefficient array is updated as soon as a new input is fed into the network.

The norm with the BP neural network is to fix the learning rate as a constant. If this constant is too large, then the network can converge fast but be unable to reach the optimal value.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Simulation and Analysis</head><p>In this section, our proposed neural network model will be evaluated with numerical results. To apply our proposed neural network model to a practical Internet of Vehicles, the following assumptions are made with regard to the vehicles. The vehicles are equipped with (i) the speed and braking-pressure sensors, (ii) DSRC or WAVE communicating devices that enable communication with other vehicles and RSU, and (iii) GPS devices capable of providing accurate information on the vehicle's location. The gender, age, driving style and experience of the chauffeurs are available from the vehicle's built-in driver profile (BDP) system. Our simulations are implemented on the MATLAB platform with the final results averaged by 100 runs with a 95% confidence interval. Note that the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval are not given in the figures; thus, the final results could be clearly observed. In addition, some important values on the figures are also checked by statistical methods. For example, for the performance comparisons between two or three variables, a Mann-Whitney Test is used to verify the significance between different variables. Correspondingly, if there are more than 3 variables, a Kruskal-Wallis test will be introduced to identify their differences on the collision probability. The detailed simulation parameters for our envisioned expressway scenario are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.   In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref>, the star curve indicates the actual collision probability determined by the selected samples, and the circle curve denotes the predicted value with our proposed model. The maximum and average differences between two curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref> are 0.08(M-W(U) = 36, P = 0.003) and 0.04(M -W(U) = 37, P = 0.008), respectively. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref>, the circle curve expresses the actual collision probability, while the lower triangular curve shows the predicted value, under the slight collision case. Correspondingly, the maximum and average differences between two curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref> are 0.19(M -W(U) = 37, P = 0.009) and 0.07(M -W(U) = 37, P = 0.015), respectively. As shown in both Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref>, the trend of the predicted curve and the curve denoting the actual samples are almost the same. This arrangement occurs because of our consideration of the multiple influential factors that lead to a collision and the model optimization to avoid local optimums, which make our model closely follow the actual probabilities with few deviations. In addition, it is worthwhile to note that for the severe collision case, our model has a small difference from the actual curve, which enables the probability of serious accidents to be alleviated. Compared to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref>, there are some larger deviations between the actual and predicted curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref>. In particular, when the number of vehicles varies from 0 to 6, the largest difference reaches to 0.19(M -W(U) = 37, P = 0.015), and our model actually underestimates the possible risks. However, by exploring the actual dataset, it can be concluded that there is indeed a probability of resulting in a collision, but the possibility is actually small. In other words, even though our model underestimated the risk when the number of vehicles varies from 0 to 6, the traffic efficiency has been increased by allowing the vehicle to drive fast, with a lower probability of causing only slight collisions. By examining the results shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref>, it can be concluded that our trained model can well balance the requirements of safety and traffic efficiency. By considering the multiple influential factors that result in a collision, our model is more accurate than the traditional collision prediction model. To assess the performance difference between our CPGN and the standard BP neural network, we compared the forecasting performance of the original and GA-optimized neural network model given the same training samples and number of iterations. Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref> show the forecasting error in the severe and slight collision scenarios, respectively.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the solid curve implies the forecasting error of our CPGN. From this curve, it can be seen that the MSE (mean square error) of the forecasting error is relatively small, with a range from -0.12 to 0.10(M -W(U) = 37, P = 0.006). The dotted line shows the forecasting error of the standard BP neural network. It can also be noted that the MSE of the forecasting error for the standard one is large, which is exemplified by the dramatic variation of the curve, with the error ranging from -0.18 to 0.18(M -W(U) = 36, P = 0.003). In fact, by improving the initialization of the coefficient arrays and the thresholds of the BP neural network, our proposed CPGN alleviates the influence from the randomness of the initial coefficient arrays and the thresholds on the network training. At the same time, since the learning rate can be adaptively adjusted based on the error of the network output, our BP neural network has been effectively improved by preventing it from becoming struck in a local optimum. As a result, compared with the standard BP neural network, our proposed algorithm can forecast the severe collision probability more accurately and more stably, thus leading to safer driving in the Internet of Vehicles.</p><p>Correspondingly, the difference between the predicted collision probability for our proposed method and the standard BP neural network has been evaluated for the slight collision case. In this figure, the solid line denotes the forecasting error of our CPGN, which ranges from -0.12 to 0.10(M -W(U) = 37, P = 0.002). It is worthwhile to note that the error curve of our CPGN fluctuates slightly, which implies a small MSE of the forecasting error. On the other hand, the dotted line represents the forecasting error of the standard BP neural network, which ranges from -0.28 to 0.18(M -W(U) = 37, P = 0.015). Compared to the results of our CPGN, the error curve of the standard BP neural network fluctuates greatly, which means that the MSE of the forecasting error is relatively large. The reason behind this difference between the CPGN and standard BP neural network is also consistent with that of Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, where the GA-optimized model could output more accurate and reasonable collision probabilities than the standard model. Next, the convergence capability of the standard BP neural network and our model is evaluated in Figs. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>. For the standard BP neural network, the learning rate is fixed. For our CPGN model, the learning rate is dynamically adjusted based on the difference in the network outputs between two consecutive iterations. Given the same accuracy requirement, we compare the number of needed iterations between two models. It can be noted that the standard BP neural network with a fixed learning rate requires almost 600 iterations to reach the required accuracy. In contrast, our BP neural network with an adaptive learning rate uses only 280 iterations, thus yielding a faster convergence and shorter calculation time. Note that by Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, the condition to determine the convergence is the same for the two models. According to the comparisons between Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>, it can be concluded that our CPGN with a faster convergence speed is more suitable for the collision prediction case with a stringent delay requirement, where online learning and model improvements are also needed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In practice, the safety of a vehicle is affected by many factors. By exploring the impacts of these factors on the rear-end collision probability, an improved neural network model is established in our paper with optimized parameters and enhanced convergence abilities. In addition, by dividing collisions into different levels, i.e., severe or slight collisions, an adaptive warning and control system could be envisioned in our future work.</p><p>To make our work practical, the vehicle collision probability predicted by the BP neural network can be further encapsulated into the corresponding alarm information and applied to the collaborative collision avoidance (CCA) application. There are three main communication methods between two nodes, i.e., unicast, broadcast and multicast. However, for our discussed case in which the rear-end collision risk was evaluated in a timely manner, the appropriate method for information exchange is only broadcasting. The rationale for this is simple and intuitional. First, a unicast communication needs a relatively steady topology between communicating pairs to enable the routing to be established for further information exchange. As a result, the unicast address will be encapsulated in the packet header of the sent packet from the source. In this way, the other nodes who even overheard the sent packets will directly drop them or forward them to the next hop along a routed path. Last, the sent packets will reach the destination in a multi-hop manner with a nontrivial elapsed time. Apparently, this unicast communication is not suitable for our discussed case, which is delay sensitive. On the other hand, the broadcasting does not need an existent route between the communicating pairs to exchange the information. In the broadcasted packets, a broadcast address will be filled to the corresponding field in the packet header. In this way, all of the nodes within the broadcasting range will immediately receive the broadcasted packets.</p><p>In fact, for our rear-end collision prediction problem, communication exists between two or more followed cars. Therefore, when there is an emergency that is ongoing, the followed cars should be quickly aware of the situation without extra delay. In this way, a possible collision might be avoided by timely braking actions from the drivers or automated vehicles. According to the above analysis, it can be concluded that only broadcasting is the appropriate way for information exchange between the endangered but undetermined cars in advance in our discussed case. For the multicast, the destination address is also selective, which makes some nodes drop the packets that are not for them. Accordingly, the multicast is also not suitable for emergency notifications between two or more vehicles in danger.</p><p>In summary, inspired by deep learning techniques, we proposed a GA-optimized BP neural network to forecast the rear-end collision probability in the IoT by jointly considering various influential factors (e.g., driver, road, vehicle and external environment). Compared with traditional methods that derive the collision probability mostly based on kinematics equations, our proposed method is more accurate and suitable for practical collision scenarios and region-specific traffic.</p><p>Our future work will study the impact of wireless communications on the performance of an automatic driving system especially in sparse environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, where the vehicular kinematics are determined by the sensed information collected by the wireless transceivers onboard or along the roadside. In addition, to accurately model the drivers' activity when driving, we will turn to the WBAN (wireless body area network) to collect the motion and attention parameters to decide when to trigger the automatic driving.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 Fig. 2</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Deep learning techniques used for accident forecasting</figDesc></figure>
