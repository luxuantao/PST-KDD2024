<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This work is motivated by the problem of multiple vehicle formation (or swarm) control, e.g., for meter-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. The objective is to use automatic control to avoid collisions between vehicles, maintain cohesiveness of the formation, be robust to loss of individuals, and scale favorably to large swarms. Models of the individual vehicles are based on the planar Frenet-Serret equations of motion, which describe how vehicle trajectories evolve under curvature (steering) control, subject to a unit-speed assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1]</ref>. While our interest is primarily in formation control for small UAVs, this approach to modeling and control could also be applicable to formations or swarms of ground vehicles or underwater vehicles, and may also be a useful starting point for understanding certain features of biological swarming or schooling behavior.</p><p>This paper presents a Lie group setting for the problem of control of formations. The setting emerges naturally from the analysis of basic cases and concomitant physical constraints on the controls. (A modern reference for control systems on Lie groups is Jurdjevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>.)</p><p>The primary analytical result we present (in Section 3) is a global convergence result for a planar two-vehicle formation control law, proved using LaSalle's Invariance Principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>. A related convergence result for a single vehicle responding to a ÿxed beacon is also presented in Section 4. A generalization of the two-vehicle control law to n vehicles is presented in Section 5, but a stability analysis is the subject of on-going work, and will be presented in a future paper.</p><p>The two-vehicle control law has an evident Lie group structure, and this structure is exploited (in Section 3) to determine the set of all possible (relative) equilibria for arbitrary G-invariant curvature controls, where G = SE(2) is the symmetry group for the control law. Ideas of "shape control" on Lie groups arise in a natural way for this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20]</ref>. The equilibrium analysis is also generalized to the n-vehicle problem (in Section 5). Finally, in Section 6, we discuss directions for future research.</p><p>The use of curvature controls can be given the mechanical interpretation of steering unit-mass, unit-charge particles by magnetic ÿelds (and hence by forces derived from vector potentials). For a discussion of the general theory of such controls, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>. This is in contrast with other current approaches to formation control that are based on scalar potentials, both in the point particle <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref> and rigid-body <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref> setting. Furthermore, our emphasis on the Lie group structure of the control laws distinguishes our work from an established physics literature in the area of large collections of interacting particles subject to local interaction laws, and giving rise to pattern-forming systems, spatially localized coherent structures (e.g., ocks), and phase transitions (e.g., from disorder to order); see, for instance, <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Modeling planar formations</head><p>The motion of a charged particle in a magnetic ÿeld is determined by the Lorentz force law,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">m r = q c ( ṙ × B);<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where r ∈ R 3 is the position of the particle, m is its mass, q is its charge, B is the magnetic ÿeld, and c is the speed of light. The corresponding Lagrangian is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L = 1 2 m| ṙ| 2 + q c ( ṙ • A);<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the vector potential A = A(r) satisÿes B = ∇ × A. The force exerted on the charged particle by the magnetic ÿeld is gyroscopic: the kinetic energy of the particle, H L = 1 2 m| ṙ| 2 , is conserved. If the particle motion is restricted to the x-y plane, and the magnetic ÿeld B = (0 0 B z ) T is perpendicular to the plane of motion, then Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) may be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r = 0 -u u 0 ṙ;<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where u = -qB z =mc and r ∈ R 2 . On the level set of H L given by H L = m=2, the particle moves at unit speed, and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) is equivalent to the planar Frenet-Serret equations of motion, ṙ = x;</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ẋ = yu; ẏ = -xu; (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where x is the unit tangent vector to the particle trajectory, y is the unit normal vector, and u is the curvature (or steering) control. Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) describes the evolution of both the position r of the particle and its orientation, given by the orthonormal frame (x; y). Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) can thus be thought of as a dynamical system evolving on SE(2), the group of rigid motions in the plane. Formations of vehicles are then treated as interacting particles in SE(2): each particle obeys a copy of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>), with its steering control u determined by an interaction law. The problem is to determine interaction laws which achieve formations.</p><p>For the UAV application, we are naturally led to consider constant-speed motion, because air speed must be maintained for such vehicles to remain aloft. Furthermore, maneuverability is limited for such vehicles, and turning involves signiÿcant energy expenditure (sideslip while banking must be overcome with additional thrust). Therefore, formation control laws for UAVs should in some sense (at least approximately) minimize the curvature of the vehicle trajectories. We are thus led to consider three critical performance issues: (1) formation cohesiveness;</p><p>(2) collision avoidance; and (3) steering "energy" minimization (e.g., for a single vehicle, the steering "energy" could be deÿned as the L 2 -norm of the steering control).</p><p>It is interesting to note that similar practical considerations apply to certain ground vehicles (and water-surface vehicles), as well. Maintaining high speeds can provide dynamic stability, which is reduced while steering, and thus it is reasonable to penalize steering "energy". Our modeling framework based on the planar Frenet-Serret equations is a natural one in which to address the issue of steering energy minimization, because the curvatures of the trajectories are precisely the control signals. In this paper, we present control laws which directly address the issues of formation cohesiveness and collision avoidance. The freedom remaining (e.g., through choice of parameters) in the control laws could be used to address the issue of steering energy minimization, and this is a topic of on-going work.</p></div>

To simplify the explanation, suppose that</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">f(|r|) = 1 - r 0 |r| 2<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and , Á, , and r 0 are all positive constants. In the expressions for the steering controls u 1 and u 2 , the terms involving serve to align the heading directions of the vehicles. The terms involving f(|r|) serve to steer the vehicles away from one another if they are too close (i.e., if |r| ¡ r 0 ), or to steer them toward each other if they are too far apart (i.e., if |r| ¿ r 0 ). The terms involving Á serve to align each vehicle perpendicular to the baseline between the two vehicles. Note that the control law given by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) is invariant under vehicle relabling. This coincides with the intuitive notion that both vehicles "run the same algorithm".</p></div>

Observe that V pair given by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">15</ref>) is continuously di erentiable on . By assumption (2) and the form of V pair , we conclude that V pair is radially unbounded (i.e., V pair → ∞ as | 1 -2 | → , as → 0, or as → ∞). Therefore, for each trajectory starting in there exists a compact sublevel set of V pair such that the trajectory remains in for all future time. Then by LaSalle's Invariance Principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>, the trajectory converges to the largest invariant set M of the set E of all points in where V pair = 0. The set E in this case is the set of all points ( ; 1 ; 2 ) ∈ such that sin( 1 -2 ) = 0, i.e., such that 1 = 2 (since ⊂ ).

While V pair penalizes the di erence in heading angles between the two vehicles, it does not favor any particular orientation of the vehicles relative to the baseline between them. It is thus necessary to examine the maximal invariant set M to determine possible equilibrium shapes of the formation.</p><p>Remark. Suppose, e.g., that f(•) is given by Eq.

Then the set of equilibria which system (14) can converge to consists of the isolated points (r 0 ; 0; 0) and (r 0 ; ; ), the connected set ( ; =2; =2), and the connected set ( ; -=2; -=2).</p><p>The isolated points (r 0 ; 0; 0), and (r 0 ; ; ) are easily interpreted: both vehicles are heading in the same direction, perpendicular to the baseline between them, and separated by a distance r 0 . These stable equilibria minimize V pair . The other sets of equilibria correspond to the two vehicles heading in the same direction, one leading the other by a distance (with the two sets distinguished by which vehicle is in the lead). These equilibria can be shown to be linearly unstable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Lie group formulation</head><p>We have introduced a model for formations based on unit-speed motion with steering control, and we have shown how the types of formation control laws we consider can be interpreted physically as point particles interacting through gyroscopic forces (recall the charged particle and magnetic ÿeld analogy). We then presented a speciÿc control law for a pair of vehicles, and gave a physical interpretation of the various terms in the control law. Indeed, the two-vehicle control law embodies characteristics of many biological swarming and schooling models, which tend to have: (1) some mechanism for heading alignment; (2) switching between attraction or repulsion based on separation distance; and (3) greater responsiveness for small separations <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>One of the key steps of the analysis was the identiÿcation of certain shape variables, representing relative angles and relative displacements.

We showed that for all initial conditions (except a thin set corresponding to the vehicles heading initially in exactly opposite directions), the system converges to a formation in which both vehicles head o in the same direction, perpendicular to the baseline between them, and separated by a distance prescribed by the function f(•). However, the particular direction that the vehicles head o in as the shape variables converge is determined by initial conditions. In practical situations, it is often desirable to direct the formation toward some particular location, e.g., toward a (ÿxed) beacon.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Guiding formations</head><p>The multi-vehicle control laws given by Eqs. (58) or (64) are starting points for the design of formation controllers for speciÿc tasks. In particular, the SE(2) symmetry that allows a reduction of the dynamics from conÿguration space to shape space means that the steady-state conÿguration-e.g., the heading direction for the rectilinear control law (58) or the center of the circular orbit for the circular control law (64)will be initial-condition-dependent. As mentioned in Section 4, in practical situations, it is often preferable to direct the formation toward some particular location, e.g., by introducing waypoints or beacons (which break the SE(2) symmetry of the control law). Another possibility for the rectilinear control law (58) is leader-following behavior, which can be implemented simply by prescribing a steering program u j0 for vehicle j 0 . The other vehicles obey the same interaction law as before, but vehicle j 0 ignores the other vehicles and instead follows its prescribed trajectory, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>.</p><p>Another technique for dynamically reconÿguring the formation is through on-the-y parameter modiÿcation. For example, changing the length-scale parameter r 0 in the rectilinear control law (58) changes the steady-state intervehicle distance, and hence the extent of the formation (transverse to the direction of motion), as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. Introducing molliÿers, i.e., allowing Á, , and to depend (in a monotonically decreasing way) on |r jk | in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">58</ref>) or (64), provides a natural mechanism for handling the interaction between distinct formations which come into proximity of each other. (For an alternative approach based on graph-theoretic methods, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref>, which considers a model proposed by Vicsek, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>. The Vicsek model is a discrete-time, unit-speed model in which each vehicle updates its heading direction at each time step by averaging its current heading direction with those of its neighbors located within a ÿxed distance of itself. A noise term also contributes to the heading-direction updates.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Sensing and implementation issues</head><p>A feature of the control laws (58) and ( <ref type="formula">64</ref>) is that all of the quantities appearing in the expressions for the controls are simple functions of distance and angle measurements between pairs of vehicles. These quantities can, in principle, be obtained without reliance on GPS measurements. One technique, which uses pairs of antennas on each vehicle for radio-frequency measurement of the required distances and angles is outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. Alternatively, optical sensing and/or acoustic sensing could be used, and there may be connections with sensing in biological swarming and schooling systems. Such a sensor-based implementation might be appropriate for large formations of simple vehicles.</p><p>Our original practical motivation was, however, to control small formations of UAVs equipped with GPS. In this context, the simplicity of the control laws (58) and (64) enables their real time implementation within the vehicles' limited on-board processing capability. Because of the high speeds of the vehicles, and the limited capacity (and imperfect reliability) of their wireless communications links, it may not be practical to exchange GPS information at each time step of (a time-discretized version of) the control algorithm. Therefore, an alternative approach in which each vehicle simulates the evolution of the entire formation, and communication is only used to correct for estimation errors, is reasonable in this context, and motion-description-language concepts are helpful <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
