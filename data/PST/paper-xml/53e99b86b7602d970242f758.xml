<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents a boundary control formulation for distributed parameter systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) and whose output is given by a spatial integral of weighted functions of the state. This formulation is directly applicable to the control of small robotic aircraft with articulated flexible wings, where the output of interest is the net aerodynamic force or moment. The deformation of flexible wings can be controlled by actuators that are located at the root or the tip of the wing. The problem of designing a tracking controller for wing twist is addressed using a combination of PDE backstepping for feedback stabilization and feed-forward trajectory planning. We also design an adaptive tracking controller for wing tip actuators. For wing bending, we present a novel control scheme that is based on a two-stage perturbation observer. A trajectory planning-based feed-forward tracker is designed using only one component of the observer whose dynamics are homogeneous and amenable to trajectory planning. The two components, put together, estimate the external forces and unmodeled system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers for twist and bending is demonstrated by simulations. This paper also reports experimental validation of the perturbation-observer-based controller for beam bending.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HERE is a considerable interest in developing robotic air- craft, which is inspired by birds and bats <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. While insect wings can be modeled as simple rigid wings, both wing flexibility and wing articulation are believed to play a key role in flight performance and agility for bird and bat flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. A new concept to control microaerial vehicles (MAVs), which uses wing articulation and is inspired by bird and bat flight, was introduced by Paranjape and coauthors <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The concept lends itself readily to aeroelastic tailoring, which is seen as an asset in the development of agile MAVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Wing flexibility not Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a robotic bat testbed, which was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) by the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Each wing is actuated at the root, and during experiments, the motion of each wing as well as the body can be measured in real time for feedback control. It provides a suitable platform to test the controllers that are developed in this paper.</p><p>Broadly speaking, continuum distributed parameter systems (DPS) such as flexible wings can be controlled in two ways: distributed control and boundary control. The former approach relies on a series or a network of actuators and sensors that are distributed over the system. The latter approach relies on actuators that are deployed only on the boundary of the system under consideration. For practical engineering applications, the most important benefit of boundary control is the reduction in the number of actuators. Despite a number of bio-inspired examples of distributed actuation, it is evident in robotic applications that implementing a distributed actuation scheme would incur substantial penalties in weight as well as costs. A distributed array of sensors is considerably cheaper and less cumbersome to implement than an array of distributed actuators. The benefits of distributed actuation can be made up, in part, by a combination of good mechanical design and effective boundary control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Literature Review</head><p>Structural stability of the wing is governed by its geometry and speed. Moreover, a typical flexible wing has at least two elastic degrees of freedom for deformation-bending and twisting-in addition to the rigid rotations at the root. The structural dynamics of the wing are coupled to the rigid body dynamics of the aircraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. It has been demonstrated in the literature that aeroelastic instabilities such as wing divergence and flutter can be mitigated using flap-based effectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> or passive energy sinks for flutter <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>There is a substantial amount of literature on boundary control theory of partial differential equations (PDEs) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> for material pertinent to this paper and references cited therein). There are two sets of methods for boundary control of PDEs. The first set consists of methods that convert the PDEs into ordinary differential equations using approximation methods such as those of Galerkin or Rayleigh-Ritz <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, or using operator theoretic tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The second set of methods leaves the PDEs intact, and uses a "model-following" approach as described in a recent book by Krstic and Smyshlyaev <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>A finite-state approximation to a PDE may wrongly render fundamental system theoretic properties like controllability and observability into functions of the approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Stability analysis that is based on a finite-state approximation is vulnerable to spillover instabilities which arise due to inadequate accounting of the residual modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. On the other hand, keeping PDEs intact makes the control law design more intuitive. A PDE-based approach has been used for maneuvering robotic arms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, controlling the Navier-Stokes model <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, and suppressing vibrations in a flexible beam <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. A gain-scheduling-based approach for nonlinear PDEs has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, while Krstic and Smyshlyaev <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> derived an adaptive controller for parabolic PDEs.</p><p>There are several PDE and ODE controller designs in the literature to stabilize and control beam bending <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, although the literature mostly concerns bending that is encountered in loaded cables, structural beams, or robotic arms. Flexible wings of robotic aircraft are unique because they experience a closed-loop interaction with the flow field around them. The loop closure happens due to the flow field itself being dependent on the wing deformation, which creates a highly nonlinear system whose modeling is susceptible to significant structural and parametric uncertainties. This necessitates a control design approach, where the control parameters can be tuned with very limited information about the system, and traditionally successful and applied methods for DPS, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, need to be replaced by a more "adaptive" approach, which can tune the control parameters to appropriate functions of the system parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Main Contributions</head><p>This paper presents a boundary control problem for wing twist (second-order hyperbolic PDE) as well as bending (fourth-order Euler-Bernoulli beam PDE), which could be applied to a wider class of PDEs, including flexible aircraft wings and robotic arms. One highlight of our approach is that it requires minimal information about the system dynamics, and the control laws are themselves in quite a tractable form, which makes them easy to apply to a real physical system. The stability of the controlled system is analyzed rigorously.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are as follows.</p><p>1) The PDE control objective that is considered in this paper is unique since the controller minimizes a tracking error of a time-varying net aerodynamic force or moment, rather than following a deformed wing shape. An abstraction of this control objective is to ensure that some weighted integral of the twisting angle equals the prescribed value.</p><p>A similar idea for a more general class of PDEs has been explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in the context of spatially distributed control. 2) We design a tracking controller for wing twist based on trajectory-planning and a PDE backstepping-based stabilizer. The procedure is called backstepping because it involves a Volterra operator with a lower triangular structure similar to backstepping transformation for ordinary differential equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and allows the controller acting at the boundary to compensate for the undesired (unmatched) dynamics. 3) With the integral of wing twist as the output, and shear force at the wing tip as the input, we show that the twist dynamics have a finite relative degree, thereby permitting a traditional ODE-based approach to control design. The tracking controller increases the stability margin of the twist dynamics by a factor of 16. An adaptive controller for a limited class of parametric uncertainties is also derived for tip-based actuators in general, and root-based actuators, when the output is the rolling moment. 4) We present a novel perturbation-observer-based controller to facilitate a trajectory-planning-based tracking controller for bending. The output of interest is the displacement of the wing tip. The perturbation observer, which is designed here uses adaptation to estimate the external forces acting on the system. The observer is split into a "particular" component and a "homogeneous" component (the notions are made more precise later). Since the homogeneous component is stable and not driven directly by external feedback, it is simpler to design a control law for it. The same control signal is sent to the actual system, whose states then converge exponentially to a region around the observer states. 5) We experimentally validate the perturbation-observerbased controller for a beam, which is controlled at the wing boundary. This paper is organized as follows. The problem formulation is explained in Section II. A backstepping-based tracking controller for wing twist, which is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, is derived in Section III. A controller for wing twist with actuation at the wing tip and its adaptive version are presented in Section IV. A controller to track tip displacement commands is derived for the bending dynamics in Section V, where an observer-based approach is introduced. Numerical simulations are presented in Section VI. Finally, experimental validation of the perturbationobserver-based control of beam bending is presented in Section VII.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MOTIVATION AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>The motivation to consider the problem of boundary control of beams stems from the problem of controlling flexible wings for agile aircraft maneuvers. Suppose that the wing has length L, a mass per unit span of m, and let y denote the spanwise coordinate. Furthermore, let ξ = ξ(t, y) and θ = θ(t, y) denote the bending and twist displacements, respectively, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. Let EI b and G J denote the bending and torsion stiffness, respectively, where I b is the second moment of area of the cross section about the local bending axis, and J is the torsional constant. Let I p denote the polar moment of inertia of the wing cross section.</p><p>The resultant wind velocity at a given point on the wing u is a sum of the aircraft flight speed u B (measured in the body axis) and the wing vibration rate u f = [0 0 ξ] T so that u = T W B u B + u f (y), where T W B is the rotation matrix from the body frame to the local wing frame. Let c denote the wing chord length. Let x e c denote the distance between the center of mass and the shear center of the wing, and x a c the distance between the aerodynamic center and shear center. The wing is loaded transversely with a load F b , which depends on the wind velocity, inertial effects that arise from aircraft acceleration and added mass effect, and gravity. An aerodynamic model to calculate F b , which is based on an ODE approximation for the time-varying flow dynamics on the wing, can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Then, the PDE model of the structural dynamics of the right wing is given by </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= F b (ξ y , θ, u, uB ) -x a cF b (ξ y , θ, u, uB )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where the subscripts t and y denote partial derivatives, i.e., ξ tt = ∂ ξ ∂ t 2 , ξ ty y y y = ∂ ξ ∂ t∂ y 4 , and so on. A similar equation can be derived for the left wing as well. The boundary conditions for tip-based actuation are given by ξ(t, 0) = ξ y (t, 0) = ξ y y (t, L) = 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ξ y y y (t, L) = F tip (t) EI b , θ(t, 0) = 0, θ y (t, L) = M tip (t) G J<label>(2)</label></formula><p>while those for root-based actuation (also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) are</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ξ(t, 0) = ξ y y (t, L) = 0 = ξ y y y (t, L) = 0 ξ y (t, 0) = δ R (t), θ(t, 0) = θ R (t), θ y (t, L) = 0. (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>Note that both root and tip control configurations have one Neumann and one Dirichlet boundary condition. In (2) and (3), F tip and M tip are the applied tip shear force and twisting moment, respectively. The root actuation variables, δ R and θ R , are the rigid dihedral (up and down motion) and wing incidence angles. The term η denotes the Kelvin-Voigt damping coefficient. It need not be the same for bending and twisting in general.</p><p>The right-hand side (RHS) of (1) depends on uB , which is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">m( uB + S(ω B )u B ) + m w ( uf + S(ω B )u f )dy = F net J ωB + S(ω B )Jω B + w (I p (y) ωf + S(ω B )I p (y)ω f ) dy = M net (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where m is the total mass of the aircraft, J is the moment of inertia tensor for the aircraft, w denotes integration over the wing, S(•) denotes the cross product, and F net and M net represent the net external (aerodynamic + gravitational) force and moment on the aircraft. Furthermore, ω B and ω f = [0 θ 0] T are vector representations of the aircraft angular velocity and the twist rate of the wing, with components in the aircraft body axes. The dynamics of the motion of the center of gravity of the aircraft, arising from the movement of the wings, have been ignored. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> for a detailed and more general derivation of the equations of motion. The important point, though, is that the structural dynamics of the wing are coupled to the flight dynamics of the complete aircraft, which are nonlinear in their own right, which makes control design a challenging assignment. Physically, F tip and M tip can be realized by using wing tip flaps, not unlike the outboard feathers on the wings of a bird. Indeed, trailing-edge effectors have been demonstrated to be effective at wing flutter suppression as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. On the other hand, δ R and θ R are easier to control, and the capability for root actuation is present naturally in flapping wing aircraft.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem Formulation</head><p>The control objective is to ensure that</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">lim t→∞ L 0 θ(t, y)dy -H(t) = 0 (net lift) (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">lim t→∞ L 0 yθ(t, y)dy -H l (t) = 0 (rolling moment) (6) lim t→∞ L 0 ξ y (t, y)dy -R(t) = lim t→∞ (ξ(t, L) -R(t)) = 0</formula><p>(bending displacement of the tip) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where H(t), H l (t), and R(t) are sufficiently smooth timevarying signals. Although we state asymptotic convergence as the objective, we will prove exponential convergence to a uniform ultimate bound. The net lift produced by the wing is L 0 0.5ρ u 2 cC L (y, α, θ)dy, where ρ is the air density, u is the local wind speed, and C L is the coefficient of lift, which depends on the angle of attack of the aircraft α, and the local wing twist angle θ. Depending on the aerodynamic theory, C L may be a nonlinear function of α and θ, and it is almost always a function of y for a finite-span wing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The term L 0 ξ y (t, y)dy = ξ(L) is a measure of the effective wing dihedral, which is a key yaw control parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. It is approximately the ratio of two components of F b . The first points are along the y direction in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, and the second points upward. Hence, it is a measure of the amount of side (y-) force produced by the wing which, in turn, produces a yawing moment on the aircraft.</p><p>Remark 1: The well-posedness of the closed-loop systems considered here can be shown by proving that the input-output map of the system exists and is bounded <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. For the twisting dynamics actuated by root control, this is achieved by designing the control to map the system onto well-posed and exponentially stable dynamics. For twisting dynamics actuated at the wing tip, the input-output map is actually a finite-order ODE, and its well-posedness follows from the standard existence and uniqueness theorems for ODEs. The well-posedness of the closed-loop bending dynamics can be shown using a transfer function approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 2: It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> that the boundary condition EI b ξ y y y = F tip in (2) needs to be replaced with EI b (ξ y y y + ηξ ty y y ) = F tip when the Kelvin-Voigt damping coefficient η = 0 in order to ensure the well-posedness of the PDE. Note, however, that this replacement essentially creates a low-pass filter for the control input F tip . As long as the dominant frequencies in F tip are smaller than the cutoff frequency 1/η, the boundary condition in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) is sufficiently accurate for control design. Moreover, the Kelvin-Voigt damping term is physically akin to distributed load [F b in (1)] on the wing, which does not affect the boundary conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ROOT-BASED TRACKING CONTROLLER FOR LIFT</head><p>In this section, we consider a twist PDE with constant coefficients. The PDE backstepping method is used to design a controller, which ensures lim t→∞ ( L 0 θdy -H(t)) = 0 [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>]. The twisting dynamics, with the angle of incidence at the wing root as the control input and the wing tip free, are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">θ tt (t, y) -bθ ty y (t, y) -aθ y y (t, y) = Mθ(t, y) θ(t, 0) = U (t), θ y (t, L) = 0.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>We first make a coordinate transformation and define</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">w(t, y) = y L θ(t, x)dx. (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>Physically, w(t, y) measures the lift, which is generated by the outboard section of the wing starting at y and terminating at the tip. Note that θ y (t, L) = 0 at the free end y = L. Hence, it follows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">w tt (t, y) = y L θ tt (t, x)dx = y L (bθ txx (t, x) + aθ xx (t, x) + Mθ(t, x))dx = bθ ty (t, y) + aθ y (t, y) + Mw(t, y) = bw ty y (t, y) + aw y y (t, y) + Mw(t, y). (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>Thus, the dynamics of w are described by the PDE w ttbw ty yaw y y = Mw, w(t, L) = 0, w y (t, 0) = U (t) (11) where U (t) is the control signal [θ R in (3)], and recall that a = G J/I p and b = ηa. Furthermore, we defined M so that Mθ = -x a cF b /I p , where F b is a linear function of θ. Note that w y (t, y) = θ(t, y). The control objective is now recast to ensure that lim t→∞ w(t, 0) = -H(t).</p><p>The method presented in this section rests on the following steps:</p><p>1) obtain a backstepping transformation w → v, which maps the dynamics in ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) into desired stable dynamics; 2) compute the boundary condition v(t, 0); and 3) derive a trajectory planning-based design with the boundary conditions of the v dynamics.</p><p>Step 1 (Volterra transform): Define the Volterra transform</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">v(t, y) = w(t, y) - y L k(y, x)w(t, x)dx (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>and the v-dynamics v tt -bv ty yav y y = Mvbpv tapv, v(t, L) = 0, p &gt; 0.</p><p>(13) Note that we have prescribed only one boundary condition for v, which follows from the fact that w(t, L) = 0. The second boundary condition v y (t, 0) has to be calculated to ensure that the lim t→∞ w(t, 0) ≈ -H(t) (this is what we can guarantee in practice, in place of asymptotic convergence). The target dynamics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> are very similar to those designed for the regulation problem in <ref type="bibr">[30, ch. 7, pp. 79-89]</ref>. However, the boundary conditions are chosen to match the control objective in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. For the regulation problem (H = 0), we can prescribe v y (t, 0) = v(t, L) = 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.

BOUNDARY CONTROL OF TWISTING MOTION: WING TIP CONTROL</head><p>Although backstepping can be employed when the twisting moment at the wing tip is used as the control input, it turns out that there is a simpler alternative, as described in this section. It relies on the fact that the system has a finite relative degree for the input-output combination of the tip moment and L 0 θ(t, y)dy, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Tip Boundary Control When All Parameters Are Known</head><p>As in the previous section, one can design a backstepping controller for the case where a control moment is applied to the free end (y = L) of the wing, while the other end (y = 0) is clamped. In fact, the procedure in both cases is identical, although the final expressions for the control law differ slightly. Alternately, in the case of MAVs, one may do without a stabilizing controller. The "tracking half" of the controller may be designed by using the output measurements. This method is useful for adaptive designs as well. We consider the wing model θ ttbθ ty yaθ y y = Mθ, θ(t, 0) = 0, θ y (t, L) = u(t) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> where the control input is a moment that is applied at the wing tip, (u(t) = θ y (L, t) = M tip in (2), and b = ηa = ηG J/I p .

Instead, only θ y (t, 0) needs to be measured or estimated. The reference signal H(t) is known. It may be difficult to inject damping because ė(t) is the rate of change of the lift and, in practice, would require differentiating noisy acceleration signals. Another interesting observation is that although the PDE system had an infinite relative degree when the root twist was chosen as the control input, the relative degree is 2 when twisting moment at the wing tip is considered as the input. Finally, the control law design that is described is this section lends itself readily to adaptation if a and/or M are unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Tracking and Stability</head><p>The problems of tracking and stabilization are distinct because the PDE system (32) is infinite dimensional. Nevertheless, a tracking controller improves stability as described presently. One way to measure the influence of a tracking controller on the stability of the closed-loop system is to set H = 0. Make a coordinate transformation w(t, y) = y L θ(t, z)dz, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, so that achieving H = 0 is equivalent to achieving w(t, 0) = 0. It follows that the transformed dynamics, with H = 0 obtained by the tracking control algorithm, are given by w tt (t, y)bw ty y (t, y)aw y y (t, y) = Mw(t, y)bw ty y (t, 0)aw ty y (t, 0)</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">w(t, L) = w(t, 0) = 0, w (t, 0) = 0.<label>(37)</label></formula><p>The third boundary condition is not entirely independent.

Since the condition for closed-loop stability is given by M/a &lt; λ 2 = 4π 2 /L 2 , it follows that the stability margin improves by a factor of 16 by using only the tracking controller, although it does not stabilize the wing for all values of M and a as backstepping does. In principle, the tracking controller converts the wing from a cantilever beam to a clamped-clamped beam. In practice, this translates to the ability to increase the wing flexibility by an order of magnitude, or increase the wing divergence speed fourfold.</p></div>

ROOT BOUNDARY CONTROL OF WING BENDING</head><p>In this section, we first determine the conditions under which there is a significant time-scale separation between the bending and twisting dynamics. When the time-scale separation is sufficient, the control laws for bending and twist can be designed separately, which simplifies the design process considerably in practice. Time-scale separation is used quite routinely to design flight control laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. We introduce one of the main results of this paper-the new perturbation-observer-based method to design a bending controller. In particular, we design a root-based bending controller [δ R in (3)] using a combination of the perturbation-observer-based approach and trajectory planning. The design of a tip controller [F tip in (2)] is straightforward using the approach that is established in this section, and we demonstrate it experimentally.</p><p>The bending PDE in (1) can be written as mξ tt + ηEI b ξ ty y y y + EI b ξ y y y y = F n (t, y, ξ t , θ, θ tt )</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">ξ(t, 0) = ξ y y (t, L) = ξ y y y (t, L) = 0, ξ y (t, 0) = u(t) (46)</formula><p>where the control input u(t) = δ R (t) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) is designed to ensure that ξ(t, L) = R(t) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The acceleration term corresponding mx e c θ in (1) has been moved to the RHS and merged into F b so that F n = F b + mx e c θ. The RHS ( <ref type="formula">46</ref>) is independent of ξ, and θ is an average value that is obtained from the faster twist dynamics. Therefore, unlike the twisting dynamics, the onset of instability in the bending dynamics will correspond to the damping becoming negative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Time-Scale Separation in Microaerial Vehicles With Flexible Wings</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, it was shown that the time-scale separation between the twisting and bending dynamics is given by the following approximate relation, when the speed is less than the torsional divergence speed</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">ω θ ω ξ ≈ 1.5 1 + ν L c (<label>47</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_65">)</formula><p>where ω θ and ω ξ denote the angular frequencies of torsion and bending, respectively, ν denotes the Poisson ratio (typically in the range 0.1-0.4), and the ratio L/c is called the aspect ratio of the wing (of the half wing, to be precise). Therefore, the twisting dynamics are faster than the bending dynamics, and moreover, the time-scale separation increases with the aspect ratio, and reduces with increasing flight speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In most practical situations, a time-scale separation of 3-5 is considered sufficient to design and implement decoupled control laws, i.e., decoupled controllers for bending and twist can be safely designed for wings with aspect ratio L/c ≥ 3. Remark 7: Wings with smaller aspect ratios would have to be modeled as plates rather than beams. Although several MAV wings do have aspect ratios smaller than 3 (such as the one built by the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>), their structure consists of a skin wrapped around or on a more traditional beam-like structure. The control design explained in this paper can still be employed for such wings. The two-time-scale approach is rigorously applicable to coupled infinite-dimensional systems, as illustrated for thermalfluid dynamics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, and for flexible structure dynamics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Moreover, although the coupled dynamics overlap over an infinitely wide frequency range, the slower subsystem has only a tiny fraction of its energy in the (semi-infinite) frequency range, where it overlaps with the faster dynamics (whose entire energy is in that range).</p></div>

Perturbation Observer for Root Control of Bending</head><p>In this section, we design a high-gain observer-based controller to facilitate a trajectory-planning-based tracking controller for bending. The perturbation observer does not predict the system states. It uses projection-based adaptation to estimate F (t, y) which would be unknown in practical situations, although one may estimate its spatial profile from the wing geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The perturbation observer is split into a "particular" component and a "homogeneous" component (the notions will be made more precise in this section). In particular, the homogeneous component is stable and not driven directly by external feedback. Thus, it is simpler to design a "tracking" control law for it. The same control signal is sent to the actual system, whose states then converge exponentially to a bounded envelope around the observer states. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows a block diagram of the perturbation observer-based controller. It is the PDE analog of feed-forward and feedback control for systems that are described by ODEs. Notice that the reference input, R(t) from ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), enters only the homogeneous component of the perturbation observer, while the feedback from the actual system only enters the particular component. 2 Poincaré's inequality</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">L 0 w 2 dx ≤ Lw 2 (0) + 4 L 2 π 2 L 0 w 2 x dx.</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.

Let ξp and ξh denote the states of the particular and homogeneous components, respectively.

Thus, the error dynamics between the perturbation observer and the actual system are globally uniformly bounded, and the bound reduces uniformly with increasing γ a . The two halves of the observer, put together, thus function as a standard perturbation observer whose job is to estimate the unknown nonlinearities and disturbances using full state feedback. In standard adaptive control methodologies, a control law is first designed assuming a complete knowledge of the system. Thereafter, the unknown system parameters, which appear in the control law, are replaced by estimated values that are supplied by the adaptation law.</p><p>In contrast, we decompose the original system into a "particular" and a "homogeneous" half, whose states are predicted by the two components that are described briefly; thereafter, a controller is designed for the homogeneous half alone so that its output tracks the difference between the system output and the output of the particular component. The homogeneous half is a linear time-invariant system with desirable convergence properties, and a feed-forward tracking control law can be readily designed for it.</p><p>Recall that the output of interest is L 0 ξ y (t, y)dy = ξ(t, L), from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. It represents the integrated value of the wing dihedral which, in turn, is a measure of the side force produced by the wing. In order to ensure that this output tracks the desired reference signal R(t), the control signal u(t) [also = ξh,y (t, 0)] is designed using trajectory planning to ensure that ξh (t, L) tracks R(t) -ξp (t, L). In particular, ξh is approximated via a polynomial expansion that involves powers of y, and the coefficients are solved using the PDE and the boundary conditions.</p><p>Remark 8: The observer-based approach that is presented here can be used for a wide class of functions F (t, y) which, as we argued earlier, are usually nonlinear in ξ y . Therefore, it is difficult to construct a polynomial expansion for F (t, y). Although trajectory planning involves a polynomial expansion, it is only done for the homogeneous half, and consequently, there is no need to obtain a polynomial expansion for F (t, y).</p><p>Remark 9: The error between the perturbation observer and the system is uniformly bounded, and the bound can be made arbitrarily small by increasing γ a . The trajectory planning approach creates a low-pass-filtered control signal, as shown in the next section, and therefore, the stability and the robustness of the system are not affected if a large value is chosen for γ a .</p><p>Remark 10: One limitation of using a perturbation observer in the present form is that it requires a knowledge of ξ(t). However, ξ(t) can be obtained using an array of sensors and spline fitting. Such an array of sensors is light and cheap enough to implement in a practical setting, and more so compared with a distributed actuation scheme.</p></div>

Trajectory Planning for the Homogeneous Component of the Observer ( ξh )</head><p>For a reference signal R(t) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, let R h (t) = R(t)ξp (t, L) denote the reference signal that has to be tracked by ξh (t, L), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. It may be possible to use more than one method to design a control signal u(t), which ensures that the output of the homogeneous half tracks the reference signal.

Comparison of Finite-State Approximation-Based and Trajectory Planning-Based Controllers for Bending</head><p>Using Galerkin's method, the beam bending dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, with the control input u(t) and its derivative u(t) as additional states, can be recast into the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">ẋ = Ax + B ū + f (x), y = Cx (70)</formula><p>where ū(t) equals the highest derivative of u(t), i.e., ü(t) = ū(t). The system can be stabilized if (A, B) is stabilizable. In particular, vectors B and C depend strongly on the choice of the basis functions. The unmatched nonlinearity f (x) can affect the tracking error as well as the stability of the closed-loop system if not compensated adequately. The unmatched nonlinearity can be tackled using backstepping, or a more direct approach such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 3,</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref> compares the performance of two controllers. The first is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and designed using a finite-state approximation of the beam, and the other is based on the perturbation observer and trajectory planning approach in Section V. The beam is assumed to be loaded uniformly, but for the purpose of control design, this load is treated as an unknown. This simple loading condition is enough to create an unmatched uncertainty in the finite-state approximation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>(a) shows the performance of a controller, which is designed using the finite-state approximation. The tracking error is less than 5% of the signal amplitude, and there is a phase lag in the system output when compared with the reference signal. The tracking error as well as the phase lag arises due to the use of a low-pass filter in the generation of the control signal. On the other hand, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>(b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> shows the tracking performance of the proposed controller which is derived from trajectory planning using a seventh degree polynomial and the perturbation observer in Section V-C. The amplitude of the tracking error is considerably smaller than the previous approach, and the phase lag is almost eliminated. For the system that is considered in this illustration, the proposed controller outperforms the conventional ODE-based controller. Note that the trajectory planning-based control signal, which is generated using (62) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_93">64</ref>), is itself a low-pass filter, albeit one that ensures, by design, a small tracking error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we describe some successful experiments, which were performed to validate the efficacy of the perturbation observer-based controller in Section V. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> shows the experimental setup. A long thin beam with a rectangular cross section is utilized for experiments. It is rigidly clamped at one end, while the other end is free to be controlled. Two small permanent magnets attached to the tip are acted on by an electromagnet whose magnetic field can be controlled by specifying a current and varying the voltage using a programmable power supply (Agilent Technologies E3642A) that interfaces with MATLAB. The interaction between the permanent magnets and the magnetic field of the electromagnet produces a force that acts on the beam tip.</p><p>Retroreflective markers are placed at seven specific points along the length of the beam, and the VICON motion capture system is used to track the coordinates of those markers. Bending displacement is determined by calculating the distance between the markers on the beam in the deformed state, and the coordinates of the corresponding markers in the undeformed state. The bending displacement is interpolated from the data that are obtained from the VICON system to obtain the deformation profile. This information is used to calculate the tip force, which is the control variable.</p><p>The electromagnet is characterized to determine a relationship between the required voltage and the commanded tip force.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has introduced a boundary control formulation for a class of PDEs whose output consists of a spatial integral of the state variable. Although the primary focus of this paper was on the control of flexible wings, this boundary control problem is directly relevant to the control of flexible continuum robotic arms described by PDEs.</p><p>In order to control wing twist using a root-based actuator, a tracking controller, which was based on PDE backstepping was designed to handle the output that has an infinite relative degree with respect to the root actuation. On the other hand, when twisting moment at the wing tip was the control input, it was shown that the system had a relative degree of 2 with respect to the input-output combination, which facilitated the design of a robust adaptive tracking controller. It was shown that the tracking controller alone could yield a 16-fold improvement in the stability margin of the system.</p><p>The force distribution that drives bending is far too complicated to be handled by backstepping alone, which motivated the development of a new perturbation-observer-based approach that is presented in Section V. The two-stage-observer-based tracking controller was designed to ensure that the wing tip tracked the desired reference profile with the bending PDE. The first component of the observer compensated for the nonlinearities and unmodeled dynamics, while the other was used exclusively for deriving the control signal. The proposed perturbationobserver-based controller was implemented in an experimental setup, which allowed us to control the bending displacement of the tip of a beam by applying a force at the wing tip. The controller performed as expected, and demonstrated reference signal tracking as well as disturbance rejection.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
