<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In 1959, a paper by Dantzig and Ramser <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> appeared in the journal Management Science concerning the routing of a fleet of gasoline delivery trucks between a bulk terminal and a number of service stations supplied by the terminal. The distance between any two locations is given and a demand for a certain product is specified for the service stations. The problem is to assign service stations to trucks such that all station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is minimized. The authors imposed the additional conditions that each service station is visited by exactly one truck and that the total demand of the stations supplied by a certain truck does not exceed the capacity of the truck. The problem formulated in the paper by Dantzig and Ramser <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was given the name 'truck dispatching problem'. I do not know who coined the name 'vehicle routing problem' (VRP) for Dantzig and Ramser's problem but it caught on in the literature and is the title of the most recent book on the problem, and some of its main variants, edited by Toth and Vigo <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In this book, Toth and Vigo <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> considered branch and bound algorithms for the VRP, Naddef and Rinaldi <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> branch and cut algorithms for the VRP and polyhedral studies, Simchi-Levi <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> set covering based approaches for the VRP, Cordeau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> the VRP with time windows, Toth and Vigo <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> the VRP with backhauls, and Desaulniers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> the VRP with pickup and delivery. Furthermore, the book reviews heuristic approaches and issues arising in real-world applications. Now the basic variant of the VRP is often given the name 'capacitated vehicle routing problem' (CVRP) to distinguish it from other members of the family of VRPs. In this paper we consider the VRP with time windows (VRPTW), where each customer must be visited within a specified time interval, called a time window. We consider the case of hard time windows where a vehicle must wait if it arrives before the customer is ready for service and it is not allowed to arrive late. In the case of soft time windows a violation of the time window constraints is accepted but then a price must be paid.</p><p>Dantzig and Ramser <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> described how the VRP may be considered as a generalization of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). They described the generalization of the TSP with multiple salesmen and called this problem the 'clover leaf problem', a name that is the very picture of the problem. If there are m salesmen we will refer to the clover leaf problem as the m-TSP, a less lucid name. If in the m-TSP we impose the condition that specified deliveries be made at every location, excepting the start location, we get Dantzig and Ramser's problem. Obviously the VRP is identical with the m-TSP if the total demand of all locations is less than the capacity of a single vehicle. The standard reference book on the TSP was edited by Lawler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In this book Hoffman and Wolfe <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> describe how the importance of the TSP comes from the fact that it is typical of other problems of its genre: combinatorial optimization.</p><p>Dantzig had previously collaborated with Fulkerson and Johnson in developing an exact algorithm to the TSP. The appearance of their paper 'Solution of a large-scale traveling-salesman problem' <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> in the journal Operations Research was according to Hoffman and Wolfe <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> "one of the principal events in the history of combinatorial optimization". In this paper the authors first associated with every tour a vector whose entries are indexed by the roads between the cities. An entry of this vector is 1 whenever the road between a pair of cities is traveled, otherwise it is 0. They also defined the linear equations that ensure all cities are visited exactly once in all representations of tours. These equations are called the degree constraints. Second, they defined a linear objective function that expressed the cost of a tour as the sum of road distances of successive pairs of cities in the tour. The problem is then to minimize the linear objective function such that the degree constraints are satisfied and the solution forms a tour. Third, the authors made a linear programming problem out of this integer programming problem by identifying just enough additional linear constraints on the vectors to assure that the minimum is assumed by some tour. This lead to the introduction of the subtour elimination constraints, which excludes solutions where cities are visited exactly once, but in a set of disconnected subtours. However, the authors pointed out that there are other types of constraints which sometimes must be added in addition to subtour elimination constraints in order to exclude solutions vectors involving fractional entries.</p><p>By now the approach of Dantzig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is basic in combinatorial optimization. The approach is concerned with identifying linear inequalities or cutting planes describing the polytope defined by the convex hull of the points in the Euclidean space that represents the set of feasible solutions of the combinatorial optimization problem. No full description of the TSP polytope is known and because the TSP belongs to the class of NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems there is no hope for a polynomial-time cutting plane method for the TSP, unless NP=P. However, as Dantzig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> showed the cutting plane algorithm can still be applied to the TSP by including the TSP polytope in a larger polytope (a relaxation) over which we minimize a linear objective function. In this way the TSP is formulated as a linear program that gives a lower bound for the TSP which can be useful in a branch and bound algorithm. Padberg and Rinaldi <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> refined the integration of the enumeration approach of classical branch and bound algorithms with the polyhedral approach of cutting planes to create the solution technique called branch and cut. This method has been very successful in solving large-scale instances of the TSP and different authors have therefore applied the polyhedral approach to other hard combinatorial optimization problems. Laporte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> were the first to apply the polyhedral approach to the VRP. Finally, we note that the field of discrete mathematics where combinatorial optimization problems are formulated as linear programs is called polyhedral combinatorics and we refer to the recent work of Schrijver <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for a detailed treatment of this subject. For a treatment of polyhedral theory we refer to Nemhauser and Wolsey <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Now we consider another basic method in combinatorial optimization which is concerned with the characterization of the objective function of the combinatorial optimization problem instead of its polytope. Using relaxation and duality we can determine the optimal objective function value, or at least a good lower bound on it (assuming minimization), without explicitly solving the integer problem. In particular, we are concerned with Lagrangian relaxation and duality. A related technique is Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, which provides an equivalent bound to the Lagrangian dual bound. In Lagrangian relaxation a set of complicating constraints are dualized into the objective function by associating Lagrangian multipliers with them. This gives us an infinite family of relaxations with respect to the Lagrangian multipliers. For a given set of values of the Lagrangian multipliers the relaxed problem is called the Lagrangian subproblem. The problem of determining the largest lower bound for this family is called the Lagrangian dual problem. A fundamental result in mathematical programming is that the Dantzig-Wolfe (generalized) linear programming problem of finding a convex combination of solutions to the (Lagrangian) subproblem that also satisfy the complicating constraints is dual to the Lagrangian dual problem. The book by Shapiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> marked the first appearance of the term Lagrangian relaxation in a textbook. In this book the treatment of duality takes a constructive rather than existential approach to Lagrangian multipliers. Everett <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> was the first to take this constructive point of view of Lagrangian multipliers, which is different from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of view of optimality involving dual variables. For a treatment of Lagrangian duality we refer to Hiriart-Urruty and Lemaréchal <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter XII]</ref>. There exist two classical algorithms for solving the Lagrangian dual problem. The simplest algorithm for the Lagrangian dual problem is the subgradient algorithm. The other classical algorithm is the cutting-plane algorithm (a row-generation algorithm), which in the primal version is the column-generation algorithm. These algorithms are convex minimization algorithms and belong to the field of non-smooth or non-differentiable optimization. For a treatment of non-smooth optimization we also refer to Hiriart-Urruty and Lemaréchal <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. According to Thienel <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the combination of branch and bound and column generation was by analogy to branch and cut called branch and price by Savelsbergh. Finally, when both variables and constraints are generated in the nodes of the search tree the procedure is called branch, cut, and price. In the last decade a number of frameworks for implementing branch, cut, and price has appeared, e.g. ABACUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, SYMPHONY <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and BCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The use of Lagrangian relaxation in combinatorial optimization was in fact also inspired by the successful application of it to the TSP by Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Lagrangian relaxation translates the problem of minimizing our objective function over a set of linear inequalities to finding the maximum of a concave piecewise affine function. There is a relationship between polyhedral combinatorics and Lagrangian relaxation. It is defined by the set of inequalities describing the convex hull of the incidence vectors of solutions to the (Lagrangian) subproblem. Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proved using general linear programming theory that the maximization of the bound provided by the 1-tree Lagrangian relaxation of the TSP gives the same bound as the linear programming relaxation of the TSP proposed by Dantzig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> using the subtour inequalities. In this way the relationship between these two seminal contributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> is established, and thereby also an example of the relationship between polyhedral combinatorics and Lagrangian relaxation. If the complete set of inequalities of the subproblem was known it could be included in the integer programming problem and minimizing our objective function over the set of complicating constraints and the inequalities of the subproblem would give the Lagrangian dual value.</p><p>The methods for the VRP with time windows are in many aspects inherited from the work done for the TSP. In recognition of this fact this paper is structured relative to the four seminal papers on the TSP formulations, i.e. the arc formulation, the arc-node formulation, the spanning tree formulation, and the path formulation. We only give a detailed analysis of the formulations in this paper but we do give a full review of the literature related to the different formulations. There are two main lines of development in relation to the exact algorithms. One is concerned with the general decomposition approach and the solution to a certain dual problem associated with the primal VRPTW. Another direction is concerned with the analysis of the polyhedral structure of the VRPTW. The idea of convexity is central to both directions.</p><p>In what follows we give the complete list of references for the VRPTW relative to the four seminal papers on the TSP. We give the name of the authors of the papers concerning the TSP followed by a list of the papers on the VRPTW that consider a generalization of the approach for the TSP.</p><p>• Arc formulation, Dantzig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>• Arc-node formulation, Miller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>• Spanning tree formulation, Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>• Path formulation, Houck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Cordeau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Kallehauge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> also give recent surveys in relation to the VRPTW. The survey of Kallehauge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> is given in the context of column generation in general and the focus is therefore the path formulation of the VRPTW which has been studied by several authors. These surveys also give a status on the computational success of the state of the art algorithms proposed in the literature.</p><p>The main contribution of this paper is that it provides a complete survey of all the formulations that has formed a basis for the exact solution of the VRPTW. The literature is approached from a different angle than the existing surveys and it includes new material on the polyhedral approach and a detailed treatment of the spanning tree formulation which is not available elsewhere. Finally, it contains a review of the recent developments related to the path formulation. The aim is also to provide an introduction to the field for people interested in the exact solution of the VRPTW and related resource constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we define the VRPTW as a graph theoretic problem and introduce notation used throughout the paper. We also describe the complexity of the VRPTW and define its polytope. In Section 3 we consider the arc formulation of the VRPTW involving only binary variables associated with arcs of an underlying directed graph. In Section 4 we review the arc-node formulation of the VRPTW where we also associate variables with nodes of the directed graph. Section 5 considers a method to find lower bounds for the VRPTW, with the help of time and capacity constrained shortest spanning trees and Lagrangian relaxation. In Section 6 we consider a method to find lower bounds for the VRPTW, with the help of time and capacity constrained shortest paths and Lagrangian relaxation. Finally, in Section 7 we present some conclusions and discuss future directions of research.</p></div>

The VRPTW variant, which have received the greatest attention in the scientific literature, has a single depot. All vehicles are based at this depot and must return here after visiting customers. However, it is common to split the single depot into a start and destination depot by making a copy of the original depot node. In this way, the start and destination depot nodes become identical. Because we split the depot the vehicle routes are no longer circuits, but paths from the start depot node to the destination depot node. Definition 2.1 of the graph makes it possible to use same definition for all formulations presented in this paper, particularly for the arc and path formulation of Sections 3 and 6.</p><p>Remark 2.2. The main part of the literature on exact methods for the VRPTW is concerned with the variant of the problem where the number of available vehicles is free. However, for VRPs in general, one can often find a limit on the number of available vehicles. Furthermore, the minimization of the number of vehicles is a typical objective for VRPs.

This implies by proof of restriction that VRPTW is NP-complete in the strong sense.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Resource inequalities</head><p>Next we introduce a formulation of the VRPTW where we also associate variables with the nodes in D. The integer solutions of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">8</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">11</ref>) are exactly the incidence vectors of k-routes, so it gives an integer programming formulation of the VRPTW. The class of subtour inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> have a cardinality growing exponentially with n. An equivalent class of inequalities with polynomial cardinality was proposed by Tucker in 1960 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.

The node variables u i play the role of node potentials in an electrical network and the inequalities involving them serve to eliminate routes that do not begin at the start depot node 0 and end at the destination depot node n + 1. This is already achieved by the subtour inequalities of Dantzig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The u i can be adjusted so that u i = j if customer i is the j th customer visited in the route which includes customer i. The node variables u i therefore represent the accumulated number of visits along a route. The inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> ensure that no more than p customers are visited in one route. For p n we have the standard VRPTW.

However, the authors considered the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> of finding the minimum number of routes required to visit the set of customers V * . This problem is equivalent to minimizing the function x( + (0)) over the VRPTW polytope. Bard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed the first branch and cut algorithm for the VRPTW based on this formulation. They considered a number of well-known inequalities from the TSP and VRP and proposed two new types of path inequalities taking into account the time windows of the problem. However, from a computational point of view the generalized subtour inequalities were the most effective. A reason for this is that the authors developed efficient heuristics for the separation of subtour inequalities. Furthermore, these path inequalities are quite weak compared to e.g. the S 1 inequalities proposed in the context of the VRPTW by Kallehauge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Brad et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> also used a so-called greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) for finding feasible solutions or upper bounds in the search tree. The branch and cut method of Bard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> showed promising computational results.</p><p>Formulating the integer programming model is only the first step when hard optimization problems are solved by branch and cut. The crucial part is the subset one considers of the finite family of defining inequalities of the associated polytope. It is well known that Tucker's inequalities generally provide worse linear programming bounds than families of inequalities with exponential cardinality. In the context of the ATSPTW Ascheuer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> noted that their model involving only binary variables cannot handle as general objective functions as a model involving node variables. One example could be a makespan type of objective where the total time spent is minimized, i.e. including waiting time. Depending on the application this should therefore be the criterion for considering node variables or not because strengthened path inequalities dominate Tucker's inequalities.</p></div>

Problem (51) is the LP relaxation of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition obtained when any solution to the VRPTW is expressed as a non-negative convex combination of arborescences. The relaxation of the VRPTW presented in this section has never been used directly in a branch and bound algorithm. The idea of using shortest spanning trees has been considered in the VRPTW context but only one paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> in the literature on the VRPTW has considered this classical approach in vehicle routing.</p><p>Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> explored the relationship between the symmetric and asymmetric TSP and shortest spanning trees in undirected and directed graphs, respectively. Consider the symmetric TSP and the complete undirected graph G=(V , E) on n nodes. A 1-tree is a subgraph T of G with nodes 1, 2, . . . , n consisting of a tree on the nodes 2, 3, . . . , n together with two edges incident with node 1. In fact, a 1-tree T in G consists of exactly n arcs, whereas a tree in G consists of n -1 arcs. So a 1-tree is a tree with an additional arc added explaining the term 1-tree. A solution to the STSP is precisely a 1-tree in which all nodes have degree 2. The Lagrangian relaxation of the STSP with respect to the degree constraints x( (v)) = 2, v ∈ V \{1}, gives a shortest 1-tree Lagrangian problem and the Lagrangian dual problem can be expressed as a pair of linear programs similar to ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_78">50</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_81">51</ref>). Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> gave a column generation method and an ascent method for finding the Lagrangian dual value. The column generation method was able to solve the program (51) for most problems with n = 12 and some problems with 13 n 20. On larger problems the convergence was always too slow and the authors noted that this was consistent with the behavior of other column generation techniques at that time referring to the work of Gilmore and Gomory <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> also described how the approach for the symmetric TSP carry over to the asymmetric case. In this case the authors introduced a type of directed subgraph they called a 1-arborescence, defined as an arborescence (directed tree) rooted at node 1 plus an arc (v, 1) joining some node v ∈ V \{1} to node 1. We remark that the authors notion of a 1-arborescence is slightly different from our r-arborescence, which is defined as an arborescence rooted at node r. Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> also described the extension of the 1-tree approach to the m-STSP in which the degree at node 1 is 2m. This would later be further generalized to the symmetric CVRP. Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> already added in the proof of their paper that a new method for computing the Lagrangian dual value would be presented in a sequel to the paper. The following paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> was a milestone in the subject of Lagrangian relaxation in integer programming. Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> successfully introduced what became known as the subgradient algorithm (a term introduced by Held et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>) and influenced future research dramatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. In 1974 Geoffrion <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> coined the term Lagrangian relaxation to describe the method of Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Because of the initial use of the subgradient algorithm, Lagrangian relaxation to some extent became synonymous with the subgradient algorithm, which is unfortunate because this algorithm is the simplest algorithm for concave maximization and suffers from several drawbacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Indeed the method is mainly attractive because it is so simple to implement.</p><p>The earliest generalization of the approach by Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> was proposed by Christofides et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> for the SCVRP based on the k-degree center tree (k-DCT) relaxation of the SCVRP. The approach allows for the possibility of single customer routes. Fisher <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> presented a different relaxation of the SCVRP using shortest k-trees. Consider the symmetric CVRP and the complete undirected graph G = (V , E) on n nodes. A k-tree is a subgraph of G consisting of n -1 + k edges that span the n nodes. The degree of the depot node 1 is 2k. As the name suggests this is a generalization of the 1-tree approach of Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The author dualized the capacity constraints (12) of Laporte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and solved the Lagrangian dual problem using the subgradient algorithm and generation of violated capacity constraints. The Lagrangian dual problem expressed as an LP similar to (50) is exponential in size since it has exponentially many variables as well as constraints corresponding to the number of capacity constraints and k-trees, respectively. Instead of using the subgradient algorithm a cut and column generation algorithm similar to the one proposed by Kallehauge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> could be used for solving the dual problem.</p><p>Fisher <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> also described an extension of his method to the VRPTW. He introduced path inequalities (11) in a formulation of the VRPTW and relaxed these to obtain the same k-tree Lagrangian problem considered for the CVRP. He did not report any computational results.

This also holds true if we formulate the linear program with respect to R (k) for some 2 k n -1. Problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_113">69</ref>) is the LP relaxation of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition obtained when any solution to the VRPTW is expressed as a non-negative convex combination of routes, however, because the subproblems are identical the convexity constraints have been aggregated <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The aggregated formulation is equivalent to the standard set-partitioning formulation of VRPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. There is a benefit in working with the decomposed formulation; it does not suffer from the drawback of symmetry present in the original formulation using the three-index variables x ij k where a given solution can be represented in several ways by permuting the k indexing. The formulation of the VRPTW presented in this section using three-index variables has never been used in a branch and bound algorithm. Problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref> has been an important construct in the formulation of algorithms for the VRPTW but more recently the dual point of view of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_111">68</ref>) has also been considered.</p><p>Houck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> presented a relaxation of the symmetric and asymmetric TSP based on resource-constrained paths. The resource in their path definition is the number of arcs contained in the path and the limit on the consumption of this resource is the number of nodes in the graph n. They called a path containing n arcs an n-path. They called a path elementary if its nodes are all distinct except possibly the first and last node. If we fix a node 1 of the (directed) graph an n-path from node 1 to node 1 is a Hamilton tour if and only if it is elementary. The problem of finding an elementary n-path of minimum cost from node 1 to node 1 is equivalent to the TSP and hence NP-complete. The authors therefore relaxed the condition that the path should be elementary. If P = (1, i 1 , . . . , i n-1 , 1) denotes an n-path and there exists a k such that i k = i k+2 for some k then the path P is said to contain a 2-cycle. It was observed that many n-paths contained 2-cycles. They proposed a tighter relaxation by forbidding paths containing 2-cycles and presented a dynamic programming algorithm for finding an n-path of minimum cost which does not contain 2-cycles. Houck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> also showed that the problem of maximizing the bound derived by this relaxation could be expressed as linear programs similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref>. They proposed a column generation scheme for solving the master problem but noted that the column generation was very slow in converging to the optimal solution. This is a typical observation in early research involving column generation. An American pioneer in linear programming computing techniques, Orchard-Hays [67, p. 240] said: "Nevertheless, the D-W (Dantzig-Wolfe) (generalized programming) algorithm presents difficulties, and overall experience with its use has been mixed. This has led to some disappointment with decomposition algorithms". Houck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> then proposed to use the subgradient algorithm following the earlier approach of Held and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and embedded this method in a branch and bound algorithm. The authors made an important concluding remark that the n-path relaxation can easily accommodate extra conditions. In fact the computational work required in the dynamic programming algorithm is just reduced when additional constraints are handled. In relation to this observation Picard and Queyranne <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> had previously considered a time-constrained variant of the TSP.</p><p>Christofides et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref> generalized the n-path relaxation of Houck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. They formulated the capacitated VRP using resource-constrained paths where the resource is the accumulated demand q along the path and called these paths q-paths. They also considered the set-partitioning formulation of the CVRP similar to (69) but instead of solving the linear programming relaxation of this master problem they proposed a relaxation which could be solved by dynamic programming. In this way their method is a two-level dynamic programming approach. In 1987 Kolen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> introduced the first method for the exact solution of the VRPTW. Kolen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> extended the two-level dynamic programming approach of christofides et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> for the VRPTW by introducing the accumulated time along the paths as an additional resource. The importance of this research comes from the introduction of the shortest path problem with time windows and capacity constraints SPPTWCC, which has played a prominent role in the research on the VRPTW. The method of Kolen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> was only capable of solving problems with up to 15 customers. The reason for this is the relaxation of the master level problem and the use of dynamic programming for solving the master problem.</p><p>The appearance of 'A new optimization algorithm for the VRP with time windows' <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> in the journal Operations Research was a breakthrough in the history of the VRPTW and furthermore an important paper in relation to the successful application of Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and column generation in general. The method of Dosrochers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is also based on the resource-constrained path formulation of the VRPTW but they used column generation to solve the linear programming relaxation of the set-partitioning master problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref>. The idea of embedding column generation in a branch and bound algorithm was previously introduced by Desrochers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> for the m-TSP with time windows. Another important contribution of Desrochers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> was the introduction of the set of test problems developed by Solomon <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The introduction of a standard set of test problems is important because it enables relative evaluation of competing algorithms. Of course different authors also need to consider the same problem variant and adhere to certain conventions with respect to the precision of problem data. Finally, the Desrochers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> paper introduced the label setting algorithm of Desrochers <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> in the context of the VRPTW for solving the shortest path problem with time windows and capacity constraints. The authors extended the algorithm to include the 2-cycle elimination scheme of Houck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Desrochers' algorithm has been an important component in the solution of a large class of resource constrained routing and scheduling problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> but as far as we are aware the manuscript 'An algorithm for the shortest path problem with resource constraints' <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> has not yet been published in an international journal.</p><p>Lagrangian decomposition is an approach that attempts to strengthen the bounds of Lagrangian relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. This approach splits the original problem into two or more different types of subproblems. Halse <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> describes three different Lagrangian decompositions of the VRPTW: VS1, VS2, and VS3. In the VS1 decomposition the VRPTW is formulated using a shortest path problem with time windows (SPPTW) and a generalized assignment problem (GAP). The VS2 decomposition considers a shortest path problem with time windows and capacity constraints (SPPTWCC) and a semi-assignment problem (SAP). Finally, the VS3 decomposition considers an SPPTWCC and a GAP by including vehicle capacity constraints in both subproblems. The Lagrangian dual problems of the three Lagrangian decomposition algorithms involves more multipliers than in the Lagrangian relaxation of the VRPTW <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>. In fact, if n is the number of vehicles then the Lagrangian decompositions requires n times as many multipliers as the Lagrangian relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>. Kohl <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> made an analytical comparison of the bounds provided by the Lagrangian decompositions and the Lagrangian relaxation and proved that the VS1 and VS2 decompositions give the same bound as the Lagrangian relaxation. Furthermore, he also proved that the VS3 decomposition gives the same bound as the Lagrangian relaxation under the assumptions that the vehicles are identical and a feasible solution exists for the VRPTW. This proof is non-trivial since the two subproblems SPPTWCC and GAP do not have the integrality property. Since the Lagrangian decompositions increase the dimension of the Lagrangian dual problem, but do not strengthen the bound of the Lagrangian relaxation, the conclusion of the analysis by Kohl <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> is that the Lagrangian decompositions are not attractive for the identical-vehicle VRPTW. Fisher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> presented computational results based on the VS2 decomposition solving the Lagrangian dual problem using the subgradient algorithm. Although the Lagrangian decomposition considered by Fisher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is not attractive compared to the Lagrangian relaxation the authors were the first to consider a path formulation of the VRPTW from the dual point of view. It would later become clear that it was the choice of the subgradient algorithm that impeded the dual approach.</p><p>Kohl and Madsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposed a method for theVRPTW based on the Lagrangian relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>. They implemented a bundle algorithm of Lemaréchal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> with an Euclidean steepest descent direction finding problem and the linesearch of Lemaréchal <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> for determining the step-size. In relation to line-searches Hiriart-Urruty and Lemaréchal <ref type="bibr">[18, p. 403</ref>] mentioned that "the modern tendency goes towards the so-called trust-region technique". A number of important issues were addressed by Kohl and Madsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. First, the dimension of the Lagrangian dual problem is smaller in the Lagrangian relaxation than in the Lagrangian decompositions. Second, the convergence of the bundle algorithm is better compared to the subgradient algorithm. Third, using a bundle algorithm it is possible to obtain a primal solution equivalent to the variables of the Dantzig-Wolfe master problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref>. Finally, in the bundle algorithm one can choose a starting point with relatively small multiplier values and gradually increase the multipliers to the optimal level. The dual approach therefore creates easier shortest path subproblems because the modified arc costs are less negative, hence less negative cycles are introduced. Kohl and Madsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> only considered problems that required very little branching so a full computational study of the path formulation from a dual point of view was not performed.</p><p>Kohl <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> and Kohl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> addressed the need for improving the bounds provided by the non-elementary path formulation with 2-cycle elimination. They introduced the k-path inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> for k = 2 in the Dantzig-Wolfe master problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref>. The path formulation then has exponentially many variables as well as constraints and a column and cut generation approach was used for solving the master problem. They embedded the column and cut generation in a branch and bound algorithm and their work is one of the early examples of what became known as branch, price, and cut algorithms.</p><p>Larsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> parallelized the branch and bound search in the algorithm of Kohl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Furthermore, Larsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> proposed column deletion and forced early stop for improving solution times. The column deletion procedure deletes columns in the master problem and is similar to the concept of the bundle reduction technique used by Kohl and Madsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, i.e. to limit the size of the coordinating master problem. The forced early stop terminates the SPPTWCC pricing algorithm as soon as one path with negative reduced cost is generated. The forced early stop is motivated from a dual point of view. In the column generation algorithm the initial master problem must be initialized with a feasible solution. If this primal solution corresponds to a dual solution with relatively high multiplier values compared to the optimal level then the difficulty of the SPPTWCC subproblem is relatively higher in the initial phase of the column generation algorithm. In the first iterations forced early stop therefore gives rapid improvements of the dual solution cutting down on solution times in the subproblem. Forced early stop is also called partial pricing whereas solving the subproblem to optimality is called full pricing.</p><p>Rich <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> and Cook and Rich <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> extended the work of Kohl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. They proposed a new separation algorithm for the k-path inequalities for k 2. The authors used the randomized algorithm given by Karger and Stein <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> that finds -minimal cuts in undirected graphs in O(n 2 log 2 n) time where n is the number of nodes. By setting = k, sets W for which x(W ) &lt; k are found. If k(W ) k in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> then W induces a valid k-path inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Moreover, they parallelized the separation of k-path inequalities and the branch and bound search.</p><p>The bounds provided by the path formulation is also improved if we require the solution to the resource-constrained shortest path problem to be elementary. Beasley and Christofides <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> proposed to add a visitation resource for each node v ∈ V * with a lower and upper limit of zero and one, respectively. The visitation resource usage when passing through node v is one. This new resource definition ensures we generate only elementary paths. However, the size of the state space increases dramatically and Beasley and Christofides <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> expected that this formulation would only be suitable for solving problems with a small number of resources and made no further studies. The approach of Desrochers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is attractive from a computational point of view because the SPPTWCC can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time. However, the method has the disadvantage of weakening the lower bound provided by the path formulation. In an effort to address this issue Feillet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, Chabrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and Danna and Le Pape <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> adapted the idea of Beasley and Christofides <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> to Desrochers' algorithm. The authors also generalized the consumption of the visitation resource. A node v is called unreachable with respect to a path P if the path already has visited v or there is no way to extend the path to v due to other resource limitations, i.e. time or capacity. The visitation resources of a path are therefore consumed either because the nodes have already been visited or because of other resource constraints. The concept of unreachable nodes is attractive because it sharpens the dominance relation. Chabrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, Danna and Le Pape <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and Feillet et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> proposed other heuristic and exact improvements incorporated in their algorithms for the solution of the elementary shortest path problem. The developments in the solution of the subproblem are interesting because the VRPTW polytope in the elementary approach is embedded in a larger polytope but not a polytope over which c T x can be minimized in polynomial time. In fact, the authors propose to solve another NP-complete problem instead of the VRPTW. In our view this raises the following research question: Can one find an algorithm for the VRPTW that compute polynomial-time lower bounds that are not dominated by the bounds obtained by the elementary path formulation? We believe that further investigations of the VRPTW polytope P VRPTW of Definition 2.13 will prove valuable in answering this question.</p><p>Kallehauge <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> presented some measurements of the effects of relaxing the condition that paths must be elementary. The measurements followed a suggestion by Natashia Boland, who raised the following research question: What are the gaps between the solutions to <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref> with elementary routes and solutions to <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref> with non-elementary routes and 2-cycle elimination for Solomon's data sets? She suggested that a good start would be to look at the non-elementary LP solutions that are produced, and check how many non-elementary paths are assigned non-zero LP values, and measuring the sum of the non-elementary LP variables over the sum of the LP-variables, i.e. the fraction of the non-elementary paths. Kallehauge <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> made these measurements for all Solomon's short-horizon 100 customer problems (excluding C1 problems) and it showed that the problems that remained unsolved have a high fraction of flow on non-elementary paths. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> we present these measurements, which are made in the root node of the branch-and-bound tree before inserting any cuts. NE CUSTOMERS is the number of customers that are visited more than once. NE PATHS/ ALL PATHS is the number of corresponding paths in the LP-solution that contain cycles compared to the total number of paths, i.e. the number of variables greater than zero. NE FLOW/ TOTAL is the sum of the LP-variables that correspond to paths with cycles and the total sum. %NE FLOW shows the percentage of the non-elementary compared to the total flow. Following a suggestion by Jacques Desrosiers, Kallehauge <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> presented the same measurements as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> after the total flow is integer, i.e. when the number of vehicles is integer. It is also possible to include e.g. subtour inequalities and 2-path inequalities in the LP-model before branching on vehicles. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows these measurements after subtour inequalities and 2-path inequalities are generated for the LP problem of the root node and we have branched on vehicles. We keep generating these inequalities as long as we only branch on vehicles. The number of times we branch on vehicles is relatively small because the number of vehicles quickly becomes integer. If we compare the column %NE FLOW in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> with the equivalent column in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> we see that the flow on the non-elementary paths is decreased after inserting cuts and branching on vehicles but it is still significant, i.e. above 20% for all unsolved instances.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows for each instance the number of k-cycles on the paths with non-zero LP-values in the optimal solution to the LP problem of the root node. k-CYCLES shows the number of cycles by type: 3-cycle/4-cycle/5-cycle/etc. It is characteristic for the instances that remained unsolved that a high fraction of the total number of cycles in the nonelementary LP solution is 3-cycles. Irnich <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> generalized the 2-cycle elimination of Houck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and Irnich and Villeneuve <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> further extended this work with detailed computational results available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Indeed the k-cycle elimination gave improvements in the lower bounds and was still computationally attractive as long as k is not too large. Irnich and Villeneuve <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> presented computational results for values of k = 2, . . . , 5. Irnich and Villeneuve <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> gave an upper bound on the increase in the number of labels. This bound is (k -1)! 2 for k &gt; 3 so there are limits to how large values of k should be used. For k = 2 the increased number of labels is a factor 2, for k = 3 it is a factor 6.</p><p>Kallehauge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> presented a stabilized cutting-plane algorithm for the Lagrangian dual problem. The idea is to force the next dual solution of the cutting-plane algorithm to be a priori in a ball or trust-region associated with the given norming. The authors use the max-norm so the master problem is an LP problem with bounds on the dual variables. This is an acceleration of the cutting-plane algorithm of Kelley <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> and Cheney and Goldstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>; the  original reference for the column generation variant is Dantzig and Wolfe <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. The trust-region ensures stability of the dual solution from one iteration to the next. Instability refers to the situation where the current iterate is closer (with respect to some norm) to the optimal solution than the next iterate. Kallehauge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> was motivated by the work on acceleration strategies at the master problem level by Kohl and Madsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. However, using the simple max-norm trust-region method the authors avoided solving the quadratic problems of the version of the bundle algorithm Kohl and Madsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> considered and they also avoided the line-searches associated with the bundle algorithm. To obtain feasible integer solutions the cutting-plane algorithm is embedded in the branch, cut, and price framework ABACUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. ABACUS is a C++ class library for solving mixed-integer linear-programs (MILP) by branch, cut, and price. It is interesting to note that the authors' formulation of the MILP presented to ABACUS only involves continuous variables. Obviously, that is because it is the dual problem (68) that is presented to ABACUS. Branching decisions are then based on the dual variables of the master problem, i.e. the path variables of <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref>. The authors also introduce inequalities in the master problem. Because the master problem is stated on the dual variables, subtour and 2-path inequalities are added as columns to this problem. Thienel <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> noted that although ABACUS was designed for linear programming relaxations there were no reasons that the branch and bound algorithm of ABACUS was restricted to this type of relaxation. However, Thienel <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> thought that it would require a generalization of ABACUS to use the system for Lagrangian relaxation. In fact Kallehauge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> showed that by remaining within the context of linear programming when solving the Lagrangian dual problem it is already possible to embed Lagrangian relaxation in this system. The trust-region method of Kallehauge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> can be used to solve anyLagrangian dual problem associated with a hard optimization problem and its implementation in ABACUS would allow the developer to concentrate on the problem specific parts, i.e. the cutting plane and the column generation, the branching rules, and the primal heuristics. Recently Jepsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> introduced 3-customer clique inequalities, called subset row (SR) inequalities, that are valid for the set-partitioning polytope of <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref>. These inequalities change the structure of the shortest path subproblem and the authors describe how the dominance relation of the subproblem is modified to incorporate these clique inequalities. This is the first example of strengthening the path formulation by introducing inequalities defined directly with respect to the path variables of the master problem. The authors solve the elementary shortest path subproblem with a bidirectional label setting algorithm developed by Righini and Salani <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> who showed that the bi-directional dynamic programming algorithm outperforms the mono-directional algorithm previously used in the literature for resource constrained shortest path computation. Jepsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> also showed that the SR-inequalities can be used in the context of the k-cycle algorithm of Irnich and Villeneuve <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The authors note that this is particularly interesting for larger VRPTW instances, since preliminary results show that the elementary shortest path algorithm is considerably slower than the shortest path algorithm with k-cycle elimination when the number of customers increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we have reviewed four different formulations of the VRPTW and the exact algorithms associated with them. We have identified and organized a total of 21 references on the VRPTW relative to four seminal papers on formulations of the TSP: arc formulation, arc-node formulation, spanning tree formulation, and path formulation. Out of these 21 references 17 references are related to the path formulation of the VRPTW. The polyhedral approach of the arc formulation is in our opinion promising and relatively little research has been conducted along these lines compared to the decomposition approach of the path formulation. Furthermore, the spanning tree formulation of the VRPTW has not been the subject of the same amount of research as the path formulation and the extension of the shortest spanning tree subproblem to time windows has not been considered in the literature. In our view it is at this point therefore an open question whether the spanning tree formulation described in this paper is effective compared to the path formulation.</p><p>The exact algorithms based on the path formulation has been very successful and the most important contributions of the research on the VRPTW lies in this area. The developments in the solution of the subproblem are interesting because the VRPTW polytope in the elementary path formulation approach is embedded in a larger polytope but not a polytope over which the objective function can be minimized in polynomial time. In fact, the authors propose to solve another NP-complete problem instead of the VRPTW, i.e. a resource-constrained elementary shortest path problem. In our view this raises the question of one can find an algorithm for the VRPTW that compute polynomialtime lower bounds that are not dominated by the bounds obtained by the elementary path formulation. We believe that further investigations of the VRPTW polytope will prove valuable in answering this question. Furthermore, the recent development of a bi-directional dynamic programming algorithm for resource constrained shortest path problems is also a significant contribution. The developments in the solution of the (dual) master problem associated with the path formulation are also very interesting. There are at least three important developments. First, introduction of strong valid inequalities for the VRPTW polytope in the master problem, e.g. generalized subtour inequalities. Second, development of acceleration techniques that addresses the instability issues with the cutting-plane algorithm for convex minimization or equivalently the column generation algorithm of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. Third, and more recently, strong valid inequalities have been introduced for the set-partitioning polytope and thereby strengthening the lower bounds provided by this relaxation. The inequalities can also be used from a dual point of view in the Lagrangian dual problem.</p><p>It is clear that 'A new optimization algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows' <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> was a very substantial achievement. It is important both for introducing the path formulation and the column generation algorithm to the VRPTW and for the future developments it inspired. It is remarkable how much of the scope and methodology of combinatorial optimization has been applied in the attack on the VRPTW. The importance of the research described in this paper comes not from the number of applications where the mathematical model of the VRPTW precisely fits, but from the fact that the vehicle routing problem with time windows is typical of other resource-constrained problems in combinatorial optimization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Definition 2 . 1 .</head><label>21</label><figDesc>A time and capacity constrained digraph D = (V</figDesc></figure>
