<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R ESEARCH interests in Boolean networks (BNs) have been motivated by the large number of natural and artificial systems whose describing variables display only two distinct configurations, and hence take only two values. Originally introduced to model simple neural networks, BNs have recently proved to be suitable to describe and simulate the behavior of genetic regulatory networks. Indeed, regulatory genes inside the cells act just like switches, that may take either an "on" or an "off" state (1 and 0, respectively), and this discovery led Kauffman <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to introduce random Boolean networks as models for genetic networks (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). As a further application area, BNs have also been used to describe the interactions among agents and hence to investigate consensus problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. BNs are autonomous systems, since they evolve as automata, whose dynamics is uniquely determined once the initial conditions are assigned. On the other hand, when the network behavior depends also on some (Boolean) control inputs, the concept of BN naturally extends to that of Boolean control network (BCN).</p><p>In the last decade, D. Cheng and co-workers have developed an algebraic framework to deal with both BNs and BCNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Their research efforts resulted in the recent monography <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, where several theoretic problems, ranging from stability and stabilizability to controllability, disturbance decoupling and optimal control, have been investigated. Even more, they stimulated further research in this area (see, for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>), aimed at deepening specific control issues. The main idea underlying this approach is that a Boolean network with state variables exhibits possible configurations, and if any such configuration is represented by means of a canonical vector of size , all the logic maps that regulate the state-updating can be equivalently described by means of Boolean matrices. As a result, every Boolean network can be described as a discrete-time linear system. In a similar fashion, a Boolean control network can be converted into a discrete-time bilinear system or, more conveniently, it can be seen as a family of BNs, each of them associated with a specific value of the input variables, and in that sense it represents a switched system. As a consequence of this algebraic set-up, logic-based problems can be converted into algebraic problems and hence solved by resorting to the standard mathematical tools available for linear state-space models and, in particular, for positive state-space models <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, first of all graph theory.</p><p>In this paper, by following this stream of research, we first address and characterize observability and reconstructibility of Boolean networks. Then, we extend this analysis to the class of BCNs. Finally, we address the problem of designing a state observer for a BCN. In detail, the paper is organized as follows: in Section II we introduce and characterize observability, by first considering two elementary cases (BNs consisting of a single cycle or of a single cycle and some vertices accessing that cycle), and then moving to the general case. Reconstructibility is the focus of Section III, where it is proved that this property is equivalent to the observability of the reduced BN consisting of all the states of the BN that belong to some cycle. Observability and reconstructibility for BCNs are introduced and investigated in Sections IV and V, respectively. Finally, in Section VI, the observer design problem for BCNs (and hence, as a corollary, for BNs), under the reconstructibility assumption, is analyzed, and two different solutions are proposed. A preliminary version of the first part of the paper has been recently presented at the CDC 2012 conference <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Notation: denotes the set of nonnegative integers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. OBSERVABILITY OF BOOLEAN NETWORKS</head><p>A Boolean Network (BN) is described by the following equations:</p><p>( </p><p>On the other hand, it can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that if, for some positive integer , , then and for every . Note that condition corresponds to the situation when all the BN states produce the same output value, a situation that surely prevents the BN from being observable. So, when discussing observability, we will always assume that , which coincides with the number of nonzero rows of , is at least 2. Based on the above reasoning, we can prove a preliminary lemma.</p><p>Lemma 1: Given a BN (3), with , consider two states and , and let and , , be the output trajectories stemming from and , 1 In the following, we will denote the state and the output trajectories stemming from by and , , respectively. Accordingly, we will use for the initial state.</p><p>respectively. Condition for every implies for every . Proof: We only need to show that the smallest such that cannot be greater than . This follows from the fact that and, therefore, as far as the sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>  . Hence the two states would be indistinguishable. On the other hand, if condition ii) is not satisfied, there would be a state belonging to the cycle, say , , generating a periodic output trajectory with minimal period , a proper divisor of , and hence it would be for every . Consequently, the two states , belonging to the cycle, would be indistinguishable.</p><p>[Sufficiency] We want to prove that if conditions i) and ii) hold, then the BN is observable. Suppose it is not. Then two distinct states and can be found that produce the same output trajectories, i.e., , . If the two state trajectories eventually coincide, then there exists a minimum such that . But then assumption i) is contradicted for the two distinct states and . So, we now assume that, at every time , . Consider the sequence of pairs , . Since all such pairs take values in the finite set , there exist , , with , such that , As both the trajectories and are periodic starting (at least) from , this means that and , , are indistinguishable states corresponding to the cyclic part . So, both these states, belonging to the cycle, generate a periodic output trajectory whose minimal period is smaller than .</p><p>Remark 1: Condition ii) in Proposition 2 can be simply restated by saying that the ordered -tuple corresponding to any periodic state trajectory is irreducible, namely it cannot be obtained by repeating a shorter ordered sequence.</p><p>Example 1: Consider the BN (3) with an cyclic matrix and . We may describe the BN by means of a suitable digraph, obtained by adding to the information regarding the static output map . This can be achieved by associating with each node of a dashed arrow, labeled by the value of the corresponding output (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>By Proposition 2, the BN is observable. In order to determine , consider the sequence . If all such vectors are equal to , then , otherwise if for some , then and hence . Note that, in general, it would not be possible to determine the initial state by stopping the output observation before time . Finally, the observability matrix in steps is Proof: [Necessity] The necessity of conditions i) and ii) follows immediately from Proposition 2. On the other hand, if condition iii) was not satisfied, there would be two initial states corresponding to two distinct cycles and generating the same periodic output trajectory, thus contradicting observability.</p><p>[Sufficiency] We want to prove that if conditions i), ii) and iii) hold, then the BN is observable. Suppose it is not. Then two distinct states and could be found that produce the same output trajectory. If and correspond to the same block then, by the same reasoning adopted in the proof of Proposition 2, either i) or ii) would be contradicted. So, assume that such indistinguishable states correspond to different blocks, say and , . Since both state trajectories eventually become periodic of periods and , respectively, the corresponding output trajectories become periodic, too, and since condition ii) holds, the minimal periods of the outputs coincide with the minimal periods of the state trajectories. Since the output trajectories coincide, by the indistinguishability of the states, it follows that . Set and let be the smallest time such that for , and assume that for some . Then the two sequences and coincide, thus contradicting iii).</p><p>Remark 2: Conditions i), ii) and iii) of Proposition 3 can be expressed in a rather compact form if we block-partition the matrix , according to the block partition of . Indeed, if we assume that where each block has size , while has size , then the BN (3) is observable if and only if i) each block has all distinct columns; 2 We assume .</p><p>ii) each block cannot be seen as the juxtaposition of two or more copies of the same block (say ), i.e., ; iii) if , the blocks and are distinct and cannot be obtained one from the other by means of cyclic permutations of the columns, i.e., a cyclic matrix and such that . Proposition 3 provides a general characterization of observability for Boolean networks. This is due to the fact that the matrix of every BN can be reduced to the block diagonal form ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, by means of a suitable permutation matrix. Indeed, every state trajectory of a BN takes only a finite number of distinct values and hence it eventually becomes periodic (possibly constant). The fact that all columns of are canonical vectors implies that the set of all states of the BN can be partitioned into say (disjoint) domains of attraction, each of them consisting of an elementary cycle (called equilibrium point, in case it consists of a single state) and a number of states that eventually converge to it.</p><p>Proposition 4: Given a BN (3), there exists and a permutation matrix such that (8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where is a nilpotent matrix, and is a cyclic matrix. Proof: Let be the distinct elementary cycles (possibly equilibrium points) of the system, and let be the corresponding disjoint domains of attraction. Clearly, a permutation matrix can be found such that is block diagonal as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Even more, we can order the states of each domain so that those belonging to are the last ones. So, it entails no loss of generality assuming that each diagonal block is as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, where is the cyclic matrix associated with . All the states of produce trajectories that belong to after a finite number of steps, which means that, for a sufficiently high and hence is nilpotent. Propositions 3 and 4 have mainly a theoretical value, as they connect the topological structure of the digraph to the observability property. However, the evaluation of the permutation matrix is computationally demanding, as it requires to determine the limit cycles and the corresponding domains of attraction. As a matter of fact, observability of a BN can be characterized in a much simpler way, whose practical feasibility will be addressed in Remark 4. To this goal it is sufficient to notice that every elementary cycle of length corresponds to distinct periodic state trajectories, depending on the specific choice of the initial state. On the other hand, each of these periodic trajectories is uniquely associated with the ordered -tuple</p><p>. By taking this perspective, we can merge the distinguishability conditions ii) and iii) into a single one. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RECONSTRUCTIBILITY OF BOOLEAN NETWORKS</head><p>In the previous section we have seen that, as for linear statespace models, observability corresponds to the possibility of uniquely determining the system initial condition from the observation of the corresponding output evolution in some interval . Reconstructibility property may be introduced along the same perspective, as the possibility of determining the system final state from the corresponding output evolution in . Definition 2: A BN (3) is said to be reconstructible if there exists such that the knowledge of the output trajectory , , allows to uniquely determine (and hence for every</p><p>). If this is the case, the smallest such will be denoted by . It is clear that observability implies reconstructibility. On the other hand, it is also obvious that if all the states of a BN belong to some cycle (or, in particular, are equilibrium points), then once the state has been uniquely identified, the state can be determined by moving backward. This means that, for a BN whose digraph is the union of cycles, observability and reconstructibility are equivalent properties. In the general case, it turns out that reconstructibility is equivalent to the fact that all states that belong to the cycles are distinguishable one from the other.</p><p>Theorem 2: Given a BN (3), the following facts are equivalent:</p><p>i) the BN is reconstructible; ii) the reduced BN, obtained from (3) by considering only the states that belong to some cycle<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> , is observable; iii) for every pair of distinct periodic state trajectories of the same minimal period , described by the two ordered -tuples the corresponding output trajectories are periodic of (minimal) period and described by two different -tuples, i.e.</p><p>Moreover, when the BN is reconstructible, , where is the minimum number of steps after which the state of the BN surely belongs to a cycle, while is the number of states of the BN that belong to a cycle, i.e.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>,</head><p>, being the distinct cycles of the BN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof:</head><p>If iii) were not satisfied, there would be two distinct initial states, and , that produce two distinct periodic state trajectories of the same minimal period and the same output trajectory. Hence at every time , we would not be able to distinguish from , the states reached at time starting from and from , respectively. So, for every choice of , from the output in , we could not determine the state at time .</p><p>Follows from Theorem 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Set</head><p>. Every state trajectory is surely periodic for , which amounts to saying that belongs to some cycle , . If , namely the reduced BN is one-dimensional, then clearly reconstructibility holds for . So, assume now that (and hence , the number of nonzero rows of , is not smaller than 2). By the observability of the reduced BN and Lemma 1, we can claim that upon observing , , we can identify the state . So, in particular, we can determine . This ensures that the BN is reconstructible and that . Remark 3: By referring to the notation adopted in Proposition 3, it is easy to see that is the largest of the nilpotency indices of the matrices , , and hence Also, if we assume again that is block-partitioned as in Remark 2, the BN (3) is reconstructible if and only if i) each block cannot be seen as the juxtaposition of two or more copies of the same block, i.e., ; ii) if , the blocks and are distinct and cannot be obtained one from the other by means of cyclic permutations of the columns, i.e., a cyclic matrix and such that . Remark 4: To conclude the section, we want to comment on the feasibility of the observability and reconstructibility tests provided by Theorems 1 and 2. To test reconstructibility, we can proceed as follows: we first determine as <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">4</ref>and let be the set of indices of the nonzero rows in . Such indices correspond to the states that belong to some cycle or are equilibrium points. If , the BN is obviously reconstructible. If , the BN is reconstructible if and only if the output trajectories corresponding to the initial states , , are distinct. This amounts to checking that all the columns of . . . corresponding to the indices in are distinct.</p><p>On the other hand, by Theorem 1, a BN is observable if and only if it is reconstructible and the matrix has all distinct columns.</p><p>The following example shows that the bound is tight. Example 2: Consider the BN (3) with It is easy to see (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) that the BN is reconstructible, since there is only one vertex (vertex 4) belonging to a cycle . Also, we easily see that (the distance from 5 to 4). We want to prove that the smallest time instant at which we are able to identify the state from the output evolution , , is just . This follows trivially from the fact that there is no chance to identify the current state from the output evolution up to that time, unless it is clear that we have reached the state .</p><p>Remark 5: Reconstructibility may be related to the indistinguishability classes , , that we introduced in the previous section. Indeed, it is easy to see that a BN is reconstructible if and only if there exists such that in every indistinguishability class of there is only one state that belongs to a cycle. This is also equivalent to saying that there exists such that, for every class of , the set consists of a single state. Clearly, is related to the observability index of the reduced BN, while to the reconstructibility index of the BN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. OBSERVABILITY OF BOOLEAN CONTROL NETWORKS</head><p>A Boolean Control Network (BCN) is described by the following equations: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where , and denote the -dimensional state variable, the -dimensional input and the -dimensional output at time , taking values in , and , respectively. and are logic functions, i.e., and . By resorting to the semi-tensor product , the BCN (10) can be described <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where , and , with , and . and are matrices whose columns are canonical vectors of size and , respectively. For every choice of the input variable at , namely for every , is a matrix in . So, we can think of the state equation of the BCN (11) as a Boolean switched system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where , , is a switching sequence taking values in . For every , the BN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> represents the th subsystem of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Definition 3: A BCN ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is observable if for any two initial states and , , and any input sequence , , the output evolutions and , , are distinct.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Chapter 16, a different notion of observability has been introduced, stating that a BCN is observable if for any two states and , , there exists an input sequence , , such that the corresponding output evolutions and , , are distinct. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (page 177), these two notions are referred to as "initial-state determinability in the strong sense" and "initial-state determinability in the wide sense", respectively. For linear state-space models these two notions are equivalent, since the observability problem can always be reduced to that of determining the initial condition that generated the free state evolution. This is not the case when dealing BCNs. Indeed, observability given in Definition 3 implies the notion of observability given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, while the converse is not true, due to the fact that it is not possible to express the (state and) output dynamics as the sum of a free and a forced evolution, and hence remove the forced component.</p><p>Observability property considered in this paper allows to determine the initial condition of a BCN when it evolves under the effect of an arbitrary input. This is consistent with the natural requirement of estimating the initial (or the current) state of a BCN, driven by an arbitrary control sequence, and hence under regular working conditions, and not by means of an ad hoc experiment. On the other hand, the observability property introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> allows to identify the initial condition of the BN only by carrying on multiple parallel experiments, as clarified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and not by making use of the observation of a single pair of corresponding input/output evolutions.</p><p>To address observability, we introduce some new notation. Since for BCNs the state evolution depends on both the state and the input we will consider instead of just state trajectories, stateinput trajectories, described by the pairs , .</p><p>Also, we say that a state-input trajectory is periodic of (minimal) period if , , (and there is no smaller for which this is true). A periodic state-input trajectory of period is described by an ordered -tuple of pairs where by this notation we mean that and, as before, we say that such a -tuple is irreducible if it cannot be expressed as the repetition of shorter tuples. This amounts to saying that is the minimal period.</p><p>Theorem 3: A BCN ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) is observable if and only if i) [distinguishability of states before state merging] for every , and for every , conditions and imply ; ii) [distinguishability of states belonging to (the same or different) cycles] for every pair of distinct periodic stateinput trajectories of the same minimal period and described by the two distinct ordered -tuples</p><p>the corresponding output trajectories are periodic of (minimal) period and described by two different -tuples, i.e.</p><p>Proof: [Necessity] If condition i) was not satisfied for two initial states and some , any input sequence , , with , would produce two state trajectories satisfying for , and the corresponding output trajectories, and , would coincide for every . Hence the two states would be indistinguishable, a contradiction.</p><p>On the other hand, if condition ii) was not satisfied, there would be two distinct initial states, and , that generate the same periodic output trajectory, corresponding to the periodic input for for where the vectors have been introduced in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">14</ref>). So, again, observability would be contradicted.</p><p>[Sufficiency] We want to prove that if conditions i) and ii) hold, then the BCN is observable. Suppose it is not. Then two distinct states and and some input sequence , , could be found such that the corresponding output trajectories, and , coincide for every . Let and , , be the state trajectories corresponding to the given initial states and input. If there would be such that the two state trajectories coincide at , i.e., , this would contradict assumption i) for the two state-input pairs </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>and</head><p>. So, we now assume that, at every time , . Consider the sequence of triples , . Since all such triples take values in the finite set , there exist , , , such that , and we may always select the smallest such . Clearly if we replace the original sequence with the sequence we still get two output trajectories completely identical (and identical to the original ones till</p><p>). But this means that the two distinct irreducible -tuples generate the same output -tuple, as This contradicts condition ii).</p><p>We illustrate the previous conditions via an example.</p><p>Example 3: Consider a BCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and suppose that <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref>The BCN can be represented by the digraph depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, obtained by overlapping the two digraphs and . (Blue) arcs labelled by belong to , while (red) arcs labelled by belong to . As for BNs, the outgoing (dashed) arrows indicate for each state the corresponding output value ( or ). It is a matter of simple computation to verify that both conditions of Theorem 3 are verified. Specifically: i) but ; but ; but ;</p><p>ii) there are two cycles of length 1 corresponding to the input , namely self loops, but they correspond to two states that generate different outputs; similarly, there are two cycles of length 1 corresponding to the input , but they generate different output trajectories. Finally, there are two distinct ordered 2-tuples that correspond to 2 periodic input-state trajectories, namely , and they generate two different periodic output trajectories . Consequently, the BCN is observable. Remark 6: Observability corresponds to the possibility of uniquely determining the initial state of the BCN, once the input sequence , , and the corresponding output , , are known. As we have seen in Section II, the initial state of an observable BN can be retrieved from the output samples , . Something similar happens with observable BCNs, as indeed, the knowledge of and for is sufficient to uniquely determine . To show this, it is sufficient to prove that if there exist an input sequence , , and two states, say and , such that for every , then there exists an input , , that makes the states and indistinguishable (i.e., for every ). Indeed, consider the sequence of pairs generated from corresponding to . Clearly, since at each time the pair belongs to the finite set , a cardinality argument ensures that there exist and , with , such that . So, as in the proof of Theorem 3, the input sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> would produce two identical output sequences.</p><p>As a matter of fact, the upper bound of can be significantly improved. To this end, we may ask how large the parameter can be chosen, so that two distinct initial states and generate two output sequences and that coincide for every , without contradicting observability. We have already noticed that all pairs , , must be distinct. On the other hand, if at some time instant , , then the output trajectories and would necessarily coincide from onward. Finally, if there exist and , with , such that and , then it is clear that the input sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> would again produce two identical output sequences. So, in the time interval all pairs , , must be distinct, cannot have two entries of same value and cannot appear in one order and in the reversed one. This implies that and hence Remark 7: To conclude we want to compare the characterization of the observability property given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> (see Theorem 9.4, pages 228-229) with a similar one that can be obtained for the observability notion used in this paper. To this end we denote by . . . the observability matrix in steps corresponding to the input sequence Clearly, the th column of provides the output sequence , , corresponding to the aforementioned input and the initial condition</p><p>. By the previous remark, observability here addressed is equivalent to the fact that all the matrices , for every choice of the input sequence, have distinct columns. The characterization given in Theorem 9.4 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> can be equivalently restated by saying that the BCN is observable in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> if and only if the matrix obtained by piling up all the matrices has distinct columns.</p><p>V.

This means that there exists a pair of corresponding input and output trajectories and , , such that for every the set of all states that are compatible at time with the given input and output has cardinality greater than 1. It is clear that and there exists such that for every , and</p><p>. Again, by a cardinality argument, we can claim that there exist two states , and two integers and such that , , and the two distinct periodic sequences corresponding to the two irreducible -tuples with and , generate the same periodic output, since Remark 8: It is worthwhile noticing that the same reasoning adopted at the end of the previous section for observability applies to reconstructibility. This ensures that, independently of , , if the BCN is reconstructible, the final state can be identified within steps. Example 4: Consider a BCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and suppose that</p><p>The BCN can be represented as in the digraph of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>:</p><p>It is a matter of simple computation to verify that both conditions of Theorem 4 are verified. More easily, it is immediate to verify that, independently of the input and of the initial condition, the output evolution from onward is either or . In the former case it means that for every , and in the latter case we have for every . Consequently, the BCN is reconstructible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. STATE OBSERVERS</head><p>The aim of this section is that of designing a state observer for a BCN, by this meaning a Boolean system that receives, as its inputs, the BCN input and output, and produces as its output an estimate of the current BCN state. We propose two different solutions. Both of them can be described by means of Boolean control networks. However, they will be derived as linear Boolean whose describing vectors consist of blocks of canonical vectors, and hence we will introduce them by making use of this more intuitive set-up. Clearly, a necessary condition for the existence of a state observer is that the BCN is reconstructible in some interval .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Shift-Register Observer</head><p>We first notice that, due to the time-invariance of the BCN, reconstructibility implies that the simultaneous knowledge of the input and the output trajectories, and , , allows 7 to uniquely determine . This ensures that the vector . . . <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> corresponding to an input/output trajectory, uniquely identifies the final state of the BCN. We let denote the reconstructibility map that associates every such "admissible" 8 vector to the final state . We want to implement the map by means of a linear Boolean system. To this end, set and introduce the (bijective) map , mapping each vector into the corresponding canonical vector Clearly, the set of admissible vectors biuniquely corresponds to the subset of "admissible" canonical vectors in . The static map if is admissible; otherwise 7 It is worthwhile to remark that even when is the smallest time instant such that reconstructibility in is possible, nonetheless, for sufficiently large values of , the minimum value of such that from and , , one can determine can be significantly smaller than . 8 In the following, an input/output trajectory will be called "admissible" if there exists an initial state such that when the input sequence at time is , then the corresponding output is . Accordingly, the vector in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) will be called "admissible" if it coincides with the restriction of an admissible trajectory to the time window .</p><p>associates every admissible vector in with the unique state that is reconstructible at time from . If is not admissible, associates it with an arbitrary state in (e.g., ). Consequently, the following Boolean system The previous observer may be described as a modified version of a BCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, namely as for a suitable choice of the matrix <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">10</ref>. The substitution of with the pair is rather natural, since this pair represents the observer input. However, differently from a standard BCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, the values of the pair we need to update the state vector at is not , but . This is unavoidable, since the state estimate at time naturally requires the information on the output at the same time instant.</p><p>Clearly, the proposed solution finds an immediate adaptation to the case of BNs. In that case, it is sufficient to replace the pair with the output alone, thus getting a state observer that takes the following form: with map allows to reconstruct the state of the BCN at time from the input and output values in the window . Such input and output samples, ordered from the oldest to the most recent, constitute the blocks of the observer state at time , whose updating consists in removing the oldest samples and acquiring the new ones. The key ingredient of the BCN state estimation is represented by the static map , that acts on the "canonical representation" of the observer state and realizes the map . On the other hand, the multiple states observer proceeds according to a different rationale. It memorizes all the current state estimates, and it updates only those that are compatible with the current output sample, by making use of the system laws and the knowledge of the current input value. So, the observer state consists of possible estimates of the BCN state. The blocks with lower index in the observer state are those that have proved to be compatible with a larger number of input/output samples, and for this reason once they prove to be compatible with the input and output for consecutive time instants, they provide the real value of the BCN state. It is worth noticing that the key ingredient of this observer is the state updating law, while the static output map, that provides the BCN state estimate, simply consists in selecting the first block of the observer state vector.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

To this end, we consider the set of all the indistinguishability classes in 1 step, namely all classes of state vectors that produce the same output value: , . We denote by the largest of the cardinalities of such classes The state of the observer is a vector with blocks, denoted by , , each of them belonging to . We first describe the algorithm, whose purpose is that of updating the (multiple, i.e., ) estimates of the BCN state at time (the blocks of ), based on the estimates we had at time (the blocks of ) and on the current input sample . At each time , the th state estimate is consistent with a number of input and output samples not smaller than those any estimate , with , is compatible with. We will further comment on the rationale underlying the algorithm after having described it. We denote by and the indices of the current block of the "arrival state" and of the current block of the "departure state"</p><p>, respectively, considered by the algorithm. Once we have considered all blocks of , takes values greater than . On the other hand, when we have updated all the blocks of the algorithm iteration is completed, and the time variable is updated. Also, we introduce two sets: and . We initialize the set with all the indices of the states that are compatible with the output sample , while is initially empty. As the algorithm proceeds, all these indices are moved from to . In detail, the observer state updates according to the following algorithm: . Also, in this case, the state observer could be described by means of a BCN, upon replacing each vector with the corresponding "canonical" representation , thus getting a system of the following kind: for suitable matrices 11 and .</p><p>To conclude the section, we want to compare the different philosophies underlying the two proposed observers. The shiftregister observer is essentially the dynamic implementation of the static map . Under the reconstructibility assumption, the 11 It is difficult to find a general expression for the matrix , whose existence is however ensured by the fact that every triple is mapped into a single vector and, consequently, each canonical vector is mapped into a unique canonical vector . On the other hand, the matrix can be easily determined along the lines we used for the previous observer. Indeed, as , we can first determine the swap matrix such that and then apply a finite sequence of dummy operators, to delete the variables . This implies that </p></div>			</div>
