<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper examines the influence of social benefits and costs on self-disclosure in the context of microblogging in China. Data were collected from 441 micro-blogging users, employing an online survey. Selfdisclosure is measured in terms of amount, depth, honesty, intent, and valence of disclosure. The study found that relationship building, enjoyment and trust in service providers are positively related to selfdisclosure, while perceived anonymity of self and perceived risk are negatively related to self-disclosure. However, convenience of relationship maintenance and self-presentation are not related to selfdisclosure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Micro-blogging is a rapidly growing and increasingly popular activity because it offers timeliness and convenience <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Microblogging is a broadcast medium in the form of blogging (e.g., Twitter, Tumblr, Sina-Weibo). It differs from traditional blogging in that its content is typically shorter, being limited to 140 character blocks. It provides a channel for people to post and share what they are reading, thinking and experiencing in their daily lives. There are some differences between micro-blogging and other social network sites (e.g., Facebook, Google+). Micro-blogging focuses on information dissemination and interactivity among users in an open platform, whereas social network sites facilitate users developing social relationships among their social networks. It is reported that by the end of 2012, there were over 500 million registered users of Sina-Weibo, a form of micro-bogging in China that is similar in nature to Twitter, with daily users numbering 46.2 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The implications of having high amounts of user generated content and updated, highly identifiable personal information published via social media has attracted the attention of disciplines ranging from marketing and operations to finance and human resource management <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The dilemma is that while social media users may enjoy the benefits of extending their social network and maintaining their existing relationships, there is also a perceived risk in disclosing their personal information. The ease of sharing information when micro-blogging has made users not only more ''transparent'' but also more vulnerable to privacy information misuse. According to the Internet Society's <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> global Internet user survey, among global users who disclosed personal information online, 19% experienced subsequent misuse of their personal information. In China, the percentage is even higher. The Internet Society [6] user survey reported that in China, 62% of users' personal information was misused.</p><p>The aim of this study is to examine the effect of perceived social costs, and benefits, of self-disclosure on self-disclosure in microblogging using Chinese data. Specifically, we examine the effects of perceived anonymity of self, perceived privacy risk, trust in the service provider, relationship building, convenience of relationship maintenance, enjoyment and self-presentation on actual selfdisclosure of information via micro-blogging.</p><p>We make four contributions to the literature on the antecedents of self-disclosure in online social networking. Recently, much attention has been given to study of the costs and benefits of online social networking <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7]</ref>. However, no study has explored the social benefits and costs as antecedents of self-disclosure among micro-bloggers in China. Hence, our first contribution is to use a Chinese sample. For cultural and political reasons, research findings using western samples may not necessarily be generalizable to China. According to Posey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the predictors of selfdisclosure could differ across cultures. Based on Hofstede <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, China can be regarded as having a collectivist culture. Countries with collectivist cultural tendencies are more open and more prone to reciprocity, both of which suggest higher levels of self-disclosure, all things being equal.</p><p>However, the monitoring of Internet traffic in China is higher than in western countries and the potential for the misuse of personal information is higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. As discussed above, the misuse of personal information provided on the Internet is reported to be higher in China than the world average. In such an environment, people will be less likely to disclose personal information, and this may also affect the relevance of specific antecedents to disclosure, such as trust in the service provider and the perceived privacy risk of disclosure. Consequently, our focus on China allows us to answer the following question: How do individuals in collectivist societies weigh costs and benefits in a technological environment where privacy invasions are expected?</p><p>The second contribution is that we extend social exchange theory (SET) to micro-blogging. Prior research has typically applied SET in the context of direct marketing, e-commerce, mobile services or online healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. Little research on information systems using SET has focused on traditional self-disclosure in interpersonal relationships. There is research addressing social media platforms, such as online chat rooms or Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7]</ref>. The benefits in the context of social networking are different from those in e-commerce and mobile services. In e-commerce and mobile services, users disclose personal information to receive financial rewards, such as discounts or rebates, or personalized services <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. However, in social media, these two benefits are much less prominent and perhaps may not exist at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. Instead, in social media platforms, the expected net social benefit may be the main motivation for self-disclosure within the SET framework. For this reason, focusing on micro-blogging, rather than ecommerce, provides an appropriate context in which to extend the application of SET.</p><p>Moreover, while SET has been applied before to social media platforms such as Facebook, because of the difference between Facebook and micro-blogging, research findings for Facebook may not necessarily be generalizable to micro-blogging. Unlike Facebook, micro-blogging is not a real-name social media. Users in micro-blogging are permitted to use either their real name or an anonymous username, although they must submit identifying information, such as their ID card number, to the service provider when they register to satisfy government requirements. This difference may influence the nature of social exchange across the two platforms in different ways. Thus, the application of SET to micro-blogging extends the range of social media to which SET has been applied.</p><p>The third contribution of the current study is that we use a multi-dimensional construct of self-disclosure. Most of the extant research on self-disclosure uses a global measure of self-disclosure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>). Self-disclosure is a multi-dimensional construct. By using a multi-dimensional construct of selfdisclosure, we can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of self-disclosure than when using a one-dimensional construct. Specifically, in this study we conceptualized self-disclosure as a second-order construct that is formatively composed of five firstorder reflective sub-constructs: amount, depth, honesty, intent and valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The fourth contribution is that we use a more comprehensive set of measures for benefit, cost and risk than existing studies. We incorporate three cost and risk variables and four benefit variables, which is more comprehensive than existing studies in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>).</p><p>The remainder of the paper is set out as follows. The next section gives an outline of SET and presents our hypotheses. The subsequent section outlines the research method, followed by the results. The last section of the paper offers a discussion and details implications and limitations of the study. In addition, we offer some directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual framework and hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Theoretical model</head><p>In this section, we propose a theoretical model of self-disclosure for Chinese micro-bloggers. Self-disclosure refers to what individuals voluntarily and intentionally reveal about themselves to others, including their thoughts, feelings, and experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Specifically, such information could be personal information, interests, feelings, photographs, messages, attitudes, experiences, relationship status, information about family and information about work, all revealed through their profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Selfdisclosure is generally a positive experience that includes benefits such as the formation of intimate associations, reduced stress levels, social acceptance and reclaimed internal energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Self-disclosure is a multi-dimensional construct that includes dimensions such as amount, depth, honesty, intent and valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In the current study, we use these five sub-dimensions of selfdisclosure. Self-disclosure amount represents the frequency and duration of an individual's disclosure. Depth reflects the degree of intimacy in the communication. Honesty refers to the accuracy with which one communicates information about oneself. Intent refers to an individual's control and awareness over his or her selfdisclosure. Valance is the positive nature of the information being disclosed.</p><p>Self-disclosure plays an integral role in relationship development. SET can be used to explain the cognitive process through which individuals engage in online self-disclosure. SET suggests that relationships are formed by a subjective cost-benefit analysis and the comparison of alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Specifically, when engaging in a relationship, the individual will perform a costbenefit analysis in which he or she will consider whether the net benefits of social actions justify the potential loss. SET predicts that the individual will engage in activities that promote relationships if the perceived net benefits of disclosure are equal to, or greater than, the perceived cost of the action <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. SET is also premised on reciprocity. A person is more likely to disclose information if he or she expects that the other party will reciprocate by sharing similar information about themselves.</p><p>SET views exchange as a social behavior that may result in both tangible and intangible outcomes. In the case of social media, such as micro-blogging, one would expect the intangible benefits to play a much larger role in affecting individuals' behavior than in a commercial context because the exchange of monetary benefits in social interaction is atypical. In social media, individuals are attracted by the potential to develop and maintain social relationships. Sometimes users interact with others in microblogging simply for relaxation and enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. These potential benefits are traded off against the perceived cost of intrusiveness when deciding whether to disclose information.</p><p>While SET provides a general theoretical foundation for our self-disclosure model, social penetration theory (SPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> can provide a more specific framework for understanding online selfdisclosure. SPT applies the essential concepts of SET to interpersonal communications generally and to self-disclosure specifically <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. SPT explains and predicts relational closeness, which is reflected in the depth of self-disclosure in a relationship. SPT posits that ''people assess interpersonal rewards and costs gained from interaction with others, and that the advancement of the relationship is heavily dependent on the amount and nature of the rewards and costs'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Such rewards may be reflected in the form of reciprocal disclosure from relational partners and the formation of deeper relationships, while costs may take the form of increased vulnerability and risks related to how others use the disclosed information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Relational engagement through disclosure occurs if the provided net benefits are positive.</p><p>Micro-blogging is characterized by both social and news media, and its flexible and broad-based architecture lowers the threshold for participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In micro-blogging, users have more freedom to decide whether to disclose information. In addition, in microblogging, individuals have more control over private information. They can choose what to disclose, how much to disclose and who can see it (through privacy settings). Furthermore, compared with other social media, such as Facebook, micro-blogging provides more freedom for individuals to self-disclose. In Facebook, people need to provide their real name for registration, while, in microblogging, although individuals are also required to provide their real name for registration, this information is only provided to the service provider. The username allows the participant to be anonymous vis-a `-vis other users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Social risks and cost</head><p>The perceived social risks and cost of self-disclosure include anonymity, perceived intrusiveness, privacy concerns, privacy risk and having to trust others <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. In the current study, the effect of perceived privacy risk, trust in the service provider and perceived anonymity of self on self-disclosure will be investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Perceived privacy risk</head><p>Perceived privacy risk refers to one's subjective belief regarding the expectation of losses associated with the release of personal information to others in electronic communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Within the SET framework, the higher the perceived risk of disclosure is, the higher one perceives the potential costs of disclosure to be; thus, the lower the prospect of reciprocation becomes and, hence, the expected net benefit of disclosure. Individuals with a high perception of privacy risk will consequently be more circumspect in deciding the amount and depth of the private information that they disclose.</p><p>The risk of misuse of personal information in electronic communities includes information collection, processing, dissemination and invasion activities. The risk of misuse of information includes a range of potential losses, including performance, financial loss, time, safety, and social and psychological loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A recent survey has shown that the most common instances of misuse of private information reported by users were unsolicited communications, stolen personal data, publicizing private information, impersonation and financial loss <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Users may not want to share information through micro-blogging if they perceive that their personal information is not effectively protected and that there exist high risks of privacy invasion. Therefore, we hypothesize H1. The perceived privacy risk of information disclosure will be negatively related to self-disclosure in micro-blogging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Trust in the service provider</head><p>Trust refers to one's belief that the other party possesses characteristics that reduce the probability of him or her engaging in opportunistic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Trust can be belief in the trustee's competency (ability to do what is needed by the truster), benevolence (trustee caring about acting in the best interest of the truster) and integrity (trustee's honesty and commitmentkeeping) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Trust can be conceptualized as trust in the social media provider or trust in the other social media members <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Within the SET framework, one would expect that the higher the level of trust is, the lower the risk of misappropriation of one's personal information and the more likely that one will believe that disclosure of information will be reciprocated. Therefore, we hypothesize H2. Trust in the micro-blogging service provider will have a positive effect on self-disclosure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Perceived anonymity of self</head><p>Perceived anonymity of self refers to the degree to which a communicator perceives the message source to be unknown and unspecified <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. There are two types of anonymity: visual anonymity and discursive anonymity. Visual anonymity refers to the extent to which people can see and/or hear the communicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. In the context of micro-blogging, any pictures or videos of the blogger can disclose information about his/her offline identity.</p><p>Discursive anonymity refers to the condition (e.g., name, age, gender, profession) in which communication cannot be linked to a particular source <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Anonymity is not dichotomous, but varies in degree. Some identity knowledge (e.g., real name and a picture) may be enough to identify a person uniquely, while other knowledge (e.g., a pseudonym and a blurred photo) may provide limited information. The knowledge provided may offer different levels of information to different people. For example, a commonly used pseudonym and a photo with a blurred face may be enough to identify a person to his/her offline friends but mean nothing to strangers. In our study, we use perceived anonymity of self to represent anonymity.</p><p>Anonymity has been regarded as one of the key means to reduce risk in micro-blogging. However, the relationship between anonymity and self-disclosure is not clear. Two theories can be used to explain online self-disclosure. One is the disinhibition effect of anonymity on self-disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and the other is SET or SPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>According to the disinhibition effect of anonymity on selfdisclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, when people have the opportunity to separate their behavior online from their offline life and identity, they feel less vulnerable and accountable for their online self-disclosure and may be willing to disclose more information. In contrast, SET/SPT may suggest that anonymous individuals will expose less information online. According to SET/SPT, people do not automatically self-disclose important information about themselves, despite their desire for acceptance and relational formation. Instead, individuals gradually disclose increasing amounts of information about themselves. Altman and Taylor <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> suggest that people are like onions in that they have several layers that they gradually peel off to expose an inner core or true self (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). SET/SPT suggests the higher the perceived anonymity of self, the lower the expected level of reciprocation. One is not giving much of one's self in terms of peeling the layers when communicating behind a veil of anonymity; hence, one expects little in return, so the level of disclosure will be lower.</p><p>Empirical evidence on the relationship between perceived anonymity and self-disclosure is also mixed. For example, Joinson <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, in the context of an online chat program, reports a positive relationship between anonymity and self-disclosure. Meanwhile Hollenbaugh and Everett <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, in the context of blog entries, have reported that visually anonymous participants disclosed less information about themselves than non-visually anonymous participants. Furthermore, Qian and Scott <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, in the context of blogging, and Posey <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, in the context of social networking sites, reported a non-significant relationship between anonymity and self-disclosure. As the impact of anonymity on self-disclosure in social networking, such as micro-blogging, is unclear and in need of more study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, the impact of anonymity on self-disclosure is posed as a research question.</p><p>RQ1: How does perceived anonymity of self affect selfdisclosure?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Perceived social benefits</head><p>As a social media, micro-blogging has provided unprecedented convenience for communication and interaction among users. The perceived social benefits of online self-disclosure include relationship building, convenience of maintaining relationships, selfpresentation, enjoyment, keeping up with trends, information storage, information sharing, showing off and reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>In the current research, we explore the effect of relationship building, convenience of maintaining relationships, self-presentation and enjoyment on self-disclosure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Relationship building</head><p>Relationship building refers to users being able to build new connections to others via social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Social networking sites, such as micro-blogging, provide good opportunities for building new relationships with like-minded individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The visibility of social connections in micro-blogging enhances the probability of meeting new friends. Users' followers are often people with common interests. Users can easily find desired persons through their followers' visual online social connections.</p><p>In the initial stages of a relationship, people are usually shy or socially anxious. Micro-blogging may facilitate communication between people by reducing nonverbal cues. According to McKenna et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the greater the control over communication and disclosure of one's true self to others in online contexts, the more opportunity exists for people to form close relationships. An intention to develop a new friendship is often related to information disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. For instance, common interests have been found to be especially important during online relationship initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. If a user hides information, such as his or her profession or hobbies, the opportunity to be found by other users with common interests is reduced. In addition, when individuals disclose more information, they send signals to others that help them to initiate contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. In the context of SET, when individuals disclose information to other parties, the other parties will feel obliged to respond in terms of providing a similar amount and depth of information about themselves. Reciprocal communication will build relationships by increasingly peeling away protective layers, revealing more information about one's inner core or true self. Hence, we hypothesize H3. Users' beliefs regarding opportunities for relationship building in micro-blogging will be positively related to their self-disclosure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Convenience of maintaining relationships</head><p>Another benefit of using social networking sites is their convenience for maintaining relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Some technical features of micro-blogging facilitate this convenience. In terms of SET, the technical features of micro-blogging make it easier to reciprocate the disclosure of information by others. For instance, the broadcasting of micro-blogging assists users to communicate with a larger group of friends with ''just one click''. If people feel it is convenient to use micro-blogging to maintain relationships, the time savings involved mean that they may use this platform more and disclose more personal information. Therefore, we hypothesize H4. Users' perception that micro-blogging is convenient for maintaining relationships will be positively related to their level of selfdisclosure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Enjoyment</head><p>Social networking sites' users may enjoy conversations on online social networks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>). In addition, Rosen and Sherman <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> view online social networking as a purely hedonic platform, arguing that enjoyment is a more powerful predictor of participation than perceived usefulness. In terms of SET, greater enjoyment increases the net benefits of the activity, all things being equal. Moreover, in an environment in which an individual is enjoying micro-blogging, he or she will be more likely to reciprocate the positive information disclosure of others. Therefore, we hypothesize H5. Users' enjoyment of micro-blogging is positively related to self-disclosure when micro-blogging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Self-presentation</head><p>Self-presentation refers to individuals' intentionally managing the impression they wish to convey to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Furthermore, stress on verbal, as opposed to nonverbal, communication cues gives users the opportunity to present only desirable information about themselves -a control possibility that they may not possess in real-world face-to-face encounters <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Micro-blogging users may make use of the available functionality by expanding on their achievements and experiences, sharing photos and taking part in groups that they deem to be appealing. Self-presentation can be an important motivation for selfdisclosure. Therefore, we hypothesize H6. Users' beliefs regarding the benefits of self-presentation are positively related to their self-disclosure when micro-blogging.</p><p>The theoretical model, displaying each of the six hypotheses and research question investigated in this study are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>

The response format was a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</p><p>As the current study was conducted in a Chinese speaking context, and the original measures of the studied constructs were in English, the survey instrument was translated from English into Chinese following the procedure recommended by Brislin <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. First, the instruments were translated from the original English into Chinese, and subsequently they were back translated into English by another bilingualist. The back-translated text was then compared with the original text. Where discrepancies existed, the Chinese version and the original English version were examined, and if necessary, the final translation was amended.</p><p>Before administration of the survey, the questionnaires were distributed to several researchers, doctoral students and microblogging users, and some revisions were made based on their feedback. Then, the questionnaire was pilot tested among a group of 110 micro-blogging users who were not included in the main survey. Analysis of the data shows that the Cronbach's alphas are all above 0.7, which indicates internal consistency of the constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Sample and procedures</head><p>We use a cross-sectional design for two reasons. First, it provides a cost-effective way to obtain a 'snapshot' of a particular population (in this case, current users of micro-blogging in China) at a particular point in time. Second, a cross-sectional design is commonly used in the area of information security research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13]</ref>), making the results comparable. The limitations of a cross-sectional design are that one cannot observe changes over time and the potential for cross-sectional variance.</p><p>Sina is the largest and most popular micro-blogging service in China. By the end of 2012, the number of Sina registered users totaled half a billion, accounting for over half of total Internet users in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Data were obtained through the use of an online electronic questionnaire. The method of data collection was appropriate for our study for several reasons. First, use of an online survey provides us with access to an enormous pool of micro-blogging users in China. Second, use of an online survey can ensure that all respondents are micro-blogging users, which will make our findings more generalizable to this population. Third, use of an electronic questionnaire can ensure that social desirability bias is kept to a minimum and that anonymity is ensured <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Specifically, we provided micro-blogging users of Sina with a hyperlink through the mention function ''@'' or the secret message service provided by Sina. The respondents were directed to the online version of the questionnaire when they clicked on the hyperlink. We randomly selected 100 people from each of the 36 provinces or autonomous regions in China and invited them to participate in the survey. All together, we sent out 3600 invitations to micro-blogging users during the period of June to August 2012. To encourage people to participate in our survey, we told participants that they had the opportunity to win a prize. Specifically, 40 participants were selected at random to win a financial prize ranging from 20 RMB to 100 RMB. We received 602 responses to the online survey. To ensure that no respondent completed multiple questionnaires and that they all responded seriously, we eliminated responses (1) from the same e-mail address; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> in which the completion time was well below the average time (average time 5 min); (3) that selected the same answers for all questions; (4) that had two or more contradictory answers to the reverse ordered questions; or <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> with incomplete data. As a result, there were 441 usable responses. The characteristics of the respondents are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> indicates that the proportion of men was a little higher than women and that most of the respondents were aged between 19 and 35 years old. The monthly income of just over 60% of respondents was less than 3500 RMB. Over three-quarters of respondents engaged in micro-blogging several times a day. More than 40% of respondents engaged in micro-blogging for more than one hour at a time. A little more than 40% of the respondents stated that they had rarely experienced privacy invasion.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> also reports characteristics of the respondents as measured by a survey of micro-blogging users administered by the Market and Media Research Centre of Beijing University and the Sina Company. That survey was administered in July 2012 and the sample size was 101,000. We use that survey to assess the representativeness of our survey. The results suggest that our sample is quite representative of micro-blogging users in China in terms of age, gender and income (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> for more details). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Method for data analysis</head><p>We employed partial least squares (PLS) using Smart PLS 2.0 to evaluate the psychometric properties of the measurement scales and to test the research hypotheses proposed in this study. We chose PLS rather than covariance-based SEM techniques such as AMOS or LISREL because of the ability of PLS to model formative second-order constructs that are composed of first-order factors, such as our conceptualization of self-disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The composite reliability (CR) index <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> was used to assess the reliability of the measurements. Gefen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> suggest that a CR score of at least 0.7 is required for reliable measurement. The average variance extracted (AVE) was used to assess convergent validity. An AVE value of at least 0.5 is required to establish convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The square root of the AVE and the correlations among all of the constructs were used to assess the discriminant validity of the measurement. For the model estimation, the amount of variance explained (R 2 ) was used for assessment of the model fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Measurement model</head><p>There are 12 reflective with 47 items in the model. The five first order self-disclosure constructs constitute a formative second order construct. In the process of model adjustment, five items with factor loadings much less than 0.7 were removed from the model. All subsequent evaluations were performed using the adjusted model.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents composite reliability, AVEs, inter-correlations and square roots of the AVEs of the constructs. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the composite reliabilities for all constructs are greater than the 0.7 threshold, suggesting high reliability. The AVEs for all constructs were greater than the recommended threshold of 0.5, establishing convergent validity of the constructs. The square root of the AVE was greater than the correlation between the construct and any other construct, indicating good discriminant validity. In addition, the correlations among all constructs are all well below the 0.90 threshold, also suggesting discriminant validity.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the loadings and cross loadings of the measure. The measurement items loaded well on their intended constructs and the items measuring specific constructs loaded more highly on their intended constructs than on any other construct, demonstrating adequate convergent and discriminant validity.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> presents the formative indicator weights and variance inflation factors (VIF) of the five first-order constructs of selfdisclosure. Each of the paths from the five first-order self-disclosure constructs to the second-order construct was significant. In addition, all of the VIFs were less than the threshold of 3.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, suggesting that multicollinearity is not a problem in our study. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> confirm that self-disclosure can be conceptualized as a second-order factor composed of amount, depth, honesty, intent and valence. Amount, depth, and honesty were shown to be the strongest contributing factors to measuring self-disclosure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Common method variance</head><p>Although a self-report cross-sectional design provides inexpensive access to a large number of respondents in a short period, this data collection method is open to potential common method variance (CMV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Following Podsakoff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, we used two approaches to test CMV. The first approach was to conduct Harman's single-factor test <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This test required that we run an exploratory, unrotated factor analysis on all of the first order constructs with the 42 items. If CMV is present, Harman's test should reveal a single dominant factor. The result of our factor analysis showed that there are 11 factors with eigenvalues greater than one, which together explain 72% of the total variance. The first factor explains 20% of the variance. Thus, Harman's test suggests that CMV is not problematic in this study.</p><p>The second approach, which is widely used, was to use a common latent factor to capture the common variance among all 42 observed variables in the model. Specifically, we conducted two confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) using AMOS for two models. First, a 12-factor model with 42 items was estimated. Each of the 42 items was restricted to being an indicator for the respective latent factor.</p><p>Fit indices of the first model were as follow: x 2 = 1415.59, DF = 748, x 2 /DF = 1.893, CFI = .936, RMSEA = .045. Generally, these indices satisfied the recommended thresholds for a good model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and hence indicate a good fit of the model to the data. In the second CFA model, in addition to the 12 factors in the first model, one additional factor to represent the unmeasured common method is added. Each of the 42 items was allowed to load on its respective theoretical factor construct, and all were allowed to load on the additional methods factor, which was constrained to be uncorrelated with the other 12 factors. The fit indices for the second CFA model were as follows: x 2 = 1415.59, DF = 747, x 2 /DF = 1.893, CFI = .936, RMSEA = .045. The fit indexes of the second CFA model were largely identical to those of the first model. Furthermore, a chi-square test comparing the first model with the second indicated that the difference between the two models was not significant (DÁx 2 = 0.00, p = n.s.), suggesting that common method bias is not a serious concern. Given that our data passed both tests of common method bias, we conclude that there is little reason to believe the data exhibit  negative effects from common method bias. Hence, we proceed to test the structural model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Results of the structural model</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> reports the result of the SEM analysis. The model explained 30% of the variance in self-disclosure. There is a statistically significant negative relationship between perceived privacy risk and self-disclosure and a positive relationship between relationship building, enjoyment, trust and self-disclosure. Therefore, hypotheses H1, H2, H4 and H5 concerning the relationships between perceived privacy risk, trust in the service provider, relationship building, enjoyment, and self-disclosure are supported. In addition, we found a negative relationship between perceived anonymity of self and self-disclosure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Main findings</head><p>In this study, we examined the effects of social benefits and costs on self-disclosure. Among the four social benefits of selfdisclosure in micro-blogging, we found that users' perceived opportunities to build relationships when micro-blogging and the enjoyment derived from micro-blogging are positively related to self-disclosure. Micro-blogging provides a platform through which individuals make new friends and are entertained. Users are willing to self-disclose more information to acquire opportunities to make new friends and to increase the level of enjoyment that they experience. Self-presentation and convenience of relationship maintenance were found not to have a significant relationship with self-disclosure. Among the three variables depicting social risks and cost, perceived privacy risk and perceived anonymity of self were found to have a negative effect on self-disclosure, while trust in the service provider was found to have a positive effect on selfdisclosure. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> presents a comparison of the effects of social benefits and costs from this study with those from previous studies on self-disclosure in the context of social networking sites.</p><p>Among all seven factors, perceived anonymity was found to have the strongest effect on self-disclosure. The finding of a negative effect of perceived anonymity on self-disclosure is consistent with the prediction of SET but contrary to the prediction of the online disinhibition effect. Consistent with SET, one might feel that fellow micro-bloggers are less likely to reciprocate the disclosure of personal information in an anonymous setting. Related to this point, anonymity may reduce the sense of connectedness one feels toward other users; hence, one is less willing to disclose personal information. Our finding is consistent with previous studies on English-speaking bloggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. In contrast, previous studies by Posey <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> with British and French samples in social networking sites and by Qian and Scott <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> employing a sample of US bloggers have found no effect of anonymity on selfdisclosure.</p><p>Enjoyment of using micro-blogging was found to have the second strongest effect on self-disclosure. Our finding implies that Chinese micro-bloggers who enjoy the use of micro-blogging will be more likely to disclose personal information. The finding of a positive relationship between enjoyment and self-disclosure is consistent with studies for social networking sites in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and for blogs in South Korea <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Relationship building was found to have the third largest effect on self-disclosure. Our findings indicate that micro-bloggers are motivated by relationship building to disclose more information. The finding of a positive association between relationship building and self-disclosure is consistent with studies for social networking sites in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Perceived privacy risk was found to have an effect approximately equal to that of relationship building on self-disclosure. The finding of a negative relationship between perceived privacy risk and self-disclosure suggests that those with a high-perceived privacy risk will refrain from disclosing information about themselves when micro-blogging. The finding of a negative effect of perceived privacy risk on self-disclosure is consistent with extant studies in the context of social networking sites in the United Kingdom, France <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Trust in the service provider was found to have a positive effect on self-disclosure. The finding of a positive relationship between trust in the service provider and self-disclosure is consistent with extent studies in the context of social networking sites in the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and a study on the effect of trust in the service provider among Facebook users in Taiwan <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, the finding differs from that in a study in the context of social networking sites in the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. An explanation of the inconsistent finding between our study and that in the US may suggest that there could be cultural differences or contextual differences on the effect of trust in the service provider on self-disclosure.</p><p>Convenience of relationship maintenance was found to have a non-significant effect on self-disclosure. In contrast, extant research in the context of Korean blog users <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and in the context of social networking sites in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> has reported a positive relationship between convenience of relationship maintenance and self-disclosure. However, one needs to note that in the measurement of the concept, Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> included relationships with both friends and strangers. Our study suggests that micro-blogging users do not necessarily increase their self-disclosure or reveal more of their personal information to maintain existing relationships. A possible explanation for the non-significant result might relate to the nature of micro-blogging compared with Facebook. Unlike Facebook, many followers in micro-blogging will be people with similar interests, but not friends or relatives. As such, individuals will not necessarily have personal relationships with followers. Thus, micro-blogging's convenience for communicating with friends is likely to be less important as a motivation to disclose information about oneself than it is in other social media, such as Facebook.</p><p>Self-presentation was found to have a non-significant effect on self-disclosure. Similarly, Krasnova et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> study with German Facebook users also reported a non-significant relationship between self-presentation and self-disclosure. According to Krasnova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, to project a certain image, social media users may in fact withhold information or only selectively release certain information. People may want to self-present through projecting a good image. To do so, they will want to present in breadth and depth their positive side, but refrain from presenting their negative side. In other words, individuals may only provide selective and asymmetric information to others. If this is the case, self-presentation may be unrelated to the amount and depth of self-disclosure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Theoretical and practical contributions</head><p>This study has contributed to the extant literature on SET and SPT on online self-disclosure in the particular context of microblogging in China. The benefits and cost of self-disclosure in the context of traditional Internet services are focused on personalized service and monetary rewards, while this study has examined the effect of the costs and benefits of social relationships on selfdisclosure. The findings from this study support the central tenants of the SET. Individuals consider both the benefits and costs of online self-disclosure. Specifically, we found a negative relationship between self-disclosure and perceived privacy risk and a positive relationship between self-disclosure and relationship building; trust in the service provider and enjoyment. The finding of a negative relationship between self-disclosure and perceived anonymity supports the SPT theory. Specifically, anonymous users may disclose less information because such users may be reluctant to self-disclose more central and intimate cores (i.e., engage in more depth of disclosure) to strangers.</p><p>This research also has some practical implications for microblogging service providers in terms of enhancing service quality and improving competitive advantage. First, the finding of positive relationships between relationship building, enjoyment and self-disclosure suggest that micro-blogging providers can encourage users' involvement by enriching their core functionality for relationship building and enjoyment. Specifically, opportunities for relationship building can include tools such as a provision to recommend new friends, a provision to reflect the user's relationship hierarchies and the listing of users currently online by category. In addition, the finding of a negative relationship between perceived privacy risk and self-disclosure implies that users' concerns about information privacy are general in nature and are not specific to any particular provider. Therefore, it may be wise for the provider to think of ways to lower risk perceptions and consequently to increase users' self-disclosure. Furthermore, our results showed that perceived anonymity of self can reduce selfdisclosure. This finding implies that service providers can consider ways to provide more functions to show users' online image. Specifically, functions such as a provision to integrate one's personal homepage or personal photo album with micro-blogging might make users less anonymous and facilitate self-disclosure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Limitations and directions for future research</head><p>There are limitations that should be taken into account prior to generalizing the findings to other social media and groups of people. Our results might be specific to the context of Chinese users using the Sina micro-blogging service and, as such, the findings may not necessarily be generalizable to other social media or other groups of people. Future studies can test the model with other social media or other groups of people.</p><p>Our results highlight a number of opportunities for future research on self-disclosure. First, in our model, we incorporated the costs of perceived risk, perceived anonymity of self, and trust of service provider and the benefits from convenience of relationship maintenance, relationship building, enjoyment and self-presentation. Further research is needed to incorporate other costs and benefits, such as trust in the online community, perceived anonymity of others and perceived reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13]</ref>. Second, perceived anonymity was measured using a subjective scale. Future studies could examine the effect of both visual anonymity and discursive anonymity, which may have different effects on the risks and benefits of self-disclosure. Future research may distinguish and measure different forms of anonymity in an objective way.</p></div>
