We present an iterative nonlinear decoding algorithm for halftoneto-contone conversion and show simulation results that compare the performance of the algorithm to that of conventional linear low-pass filtering. We find that the new technique results in subjectively superior reconstruction. As there is a natural relationship between error diffusion and EA modulation, our reconstruction algorithm can also be applied to the decoding problem for EA modulators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>ALFTONING is the process of converting continuous-H tone (contone) images into a form suitable for display on binary devices [ 11-[4]. Halftoning is important because images such as photographs can have a large dynamic range, whereas display devices such as newspaper printers, laser printers, and some computer screens can only display binary images. The idea behind halftoning is to create a binary image whose lowfrequency content approximates that of a contone image and whose high-frequency content is not visibly correlated with the low-frequency content. At a suitable distance, the human visual system then acts approximately as a low-pass filter.</p><p>The halftoning process has been used in the printing industry for over a hundred years, and a large body of practical and theoretical knowledge has been accumulated [2]. The work reported in this paper and many others <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> is mainly concemed with digital or electronic halftoning rather than manual halftoning, which involves contact screens. In the former problem type, an image is manipulated as a 2-D array of discrete samples, whereas in the latter problem type, parameters such as the sizes and shapes of ink dots can be varied. For simplicity, we only consider black-and-white (B/W) contone images.</p><p>A number of algorithms 'for halftoning images are available. The reader is referred to reviews such as [2]-[4] for a detailed discussion of the relative merits of these algorithms. In this paper, we consider the, error diffusion (ED) algorithm <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> and address the problem of reconstructing a contone image from its halftoned version. This problem arises when high- quality images are needed for immediate viewing or when the underlying contone image needs to be decimated, interpolated, extrapolated, linearly or nonlinearly filtered and enhanced, compressed <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, or manipulated in any other way. In these situations, it is natural to reconstruct the contone image, perform the desired operations on it, and halftone the result. Finally, in many applications such as facsimile and desk-top publishing, it may be desired to convert back and forth between different halftone images for display on printers and monitors with varying dynamic range and resolution characteristics.</p><p>There are several existing approaches to halftone-to-contone conversion. Fan [9] describes a logic-filtering approach for screened halftone images. In [8], Ting and Riskin present, among other results, a novel conversion approach based on error-diffused halftone images. Their approach is to decode each halftoned pixel based on the 3 x 3 neighborhood of the pixel; the decoded contone pixel value is obtained from a look-up table whose contents have previously been optimized through training on a suite of test images.</p><p>The most common approach to halftone-to-contone conversion is low-pass filtering <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. However, there is more information in a halftone image than is extracted by a linear filter because linear filtering does not use knowledge of the detailed mechanism by which the halftone image was generated. Our goal is to use this extra information to obtain sharper and more pleasing contone reconstructions. This goal is achieved with an iterative, nonlinear algorithm based on projections onto convex sets (POCS) <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. Our simulations show that the algorithm results in higher reconstruction quality than linear filtering. The theory of POCS has previously been applied to many signal and image reconstruction problems [ 1 11, including reconstruction of contone images from screened halftones [6],</p><p>Our proposed algorithm is inspired by our work on nonlinear decoding for EA modulators <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. We thus exploit the relationship between ED and EA modulation first noted in [ 11.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section I1 describes ED, and Section I11 describes our proposed reconstruction algorithm. Section IV shows sample results of our proposed algorithm, and Section V contains a summary. ~91.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">MODIFIED ERROR DIFFUSION</head><p>In Section 11-A, we give a brief, general introduction to error diffusion, and in Sections 11-B and C, we lay the groundwork for the reconstruction algorithm described in Section 111. In Section 11-B, we discuss the choice of a computational procedure (CP) for ED halftoning. Although our chosen CP differs 1057-7149/95$04.00 0 1995 IEEE slightly from the traditional one, it tremendously simplifies our reconstruction algorithm. In Section 11-C, we derive the space-domain description of ED that results from our choice of CP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Introduction</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a diagram of an ED encoder that is a 2-D discrete-time system. For comparison, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows an interpolative EA modulator that is a 1-D system used in analog-to-digital conversion. Similar to a EA encoder, an ED encoder contains a 1-b quantizer Q and a linear filter G in a negative feedback loop and has a continuous-amplitude input and binary output. Q is given by where Lhigh = 255 and Lmid = $Lhigh = 127$, as we consider 8-b images. To be implementable, the 2-D filter G( z 1 , z 2 ) must have finite-extent input and output masks, and the system must be recursively computable <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. For G, we will use the original Floyd-Steinberg input and output masks shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3 [7]</ref>. The equation for this ED filter is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f(n1,np) = e ( w , n 2 ) -k &amp; [ 7 f ( n i -1, n2) -k f ( n i -1, n 2 -1 ) f s f ( n 1 , 722 -1 ) f 3 f ( n i f 1,122 -I)].</formula><p>The impulse response of the filter G has the infinite-extent region of support (ROS) R, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(a). A number of improved filters with larger masks have been proposed to overcome problems with halftoning artifacts <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. However, for simplicity, we use the original filter throughout this paper. We assume that the masks are known. If this is not the case, an interesting filter estimation problem arises. For an approach to a similar problem, see [6].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Computational Procedure for Modified Error Diffusion</head><p>A 2-D discrete-time system such as an ED encoder requires a computational procedure that describes how to compute the system output from the encoder input [ 141. In this section, we define the particular CP that we will use, which is slightly modified from the standard one in order to significantly reduce the complexity of our reconstruction algorithm. The modification does not affect the quality of the halftoning.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I +Rk (a) (b)</formula><p>Our CP is inspired by the general procedure described in <ref type="bibr">Lim [14]</ref> for linear systems and is outlined below. Using our procedure, we derive a space-domain description of the ED encoder relating the unknown encoder input {z(nl,n2)}, the known encoder output { y ( n l , n 2 ) } , and known spaceinvariant impulse responses determined by G.</p><p>To compute the output of the ED encoder for a given input, we must specify both boundary conditions and a recursive computational order <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. We will begin with the boundary conditions that specify the region over which the encoder output is guaranteed to be zero, given that the encoder input is restricted to a specified region of support R, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. We will set R, = <ref type="bibr">((n1,na)</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">lO 5 n1 5 N -1 , O 5 712 5 N -l } ,</formula><p>where N is the image size. Let us pretend for a moment that the quantizer Q in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>is replaced by an open connection.</head><p>As the filter input mask is a Kronecker 6 function, the ROS of { f ( n l , n a ) } is also R,. Therefore, both the filter output Having specified boundary conditions, we now complete our CP for the ED encoder by specifying a recursively computable order <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> in which encoder input samples can be processed.</p><p>A natural order of computation through Rg would be line by line. However, we only need the ED output over the region R, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4(b)</ref>. We can therefore discard any lines above R, in the nz direction as well as any samples with large enough values of n1 so that they do not affect the encoder output over R,. To calculate the encoder output over R,, it thus suffices to go line by line through the finite region RL shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4(b)</ref>. In contrast, the standard CP forces the quantization error to be zero outside of R,, which leads to a violation of the governing difference equations over R,; here, we have defined R, to be the part of Rk that does not overlap with R,.</p><p>Although our proposed CP simplifies the reconstruction, it has one potential problem: The decoder only has access to the encoder output over R,, and due to the feedback, this encoder output may be affected by encoder outputs over R,. However, we show in Appendix A that for our encoder, an encoder output sample is necessarily zero whenever the corresponding encoder input sample is zero. Therefore, the discarded encoder outputs over R, carry no information.</p><p>Although our proposed CP generates the same binary image over R, as the standard CP does, it generates a different image over R,. This is because our procedure requires the encoder to process all of RL, rather than only R,, which affects the encoder states. Therefore, even though the encoder output is zero over R,, the diffused errors are nonzero, and this affects the encoder outputs over the entire image. Nevertheless, we find that the two halftoning techniques result in subjectively similar quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C . Resulting Space-Domain Description</head><p>We now derive a space-domain description of the ED encoder. Referring to Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we will write the quantizer input u(n1,nz) as a linear combination of input samples (z(nl,n2)} and output samples {y(nl,nz)}. For given filter input and output masks, we can use standard methods <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> to calculate the space-invariant impulse response (g,(nl, nz)} from the encoder input { z ( n ~, n z ) } to the quantizer input (u(n1, n2)} and, similarly, the impulse response {gy(nl, n2)} from the encoder output (y(n1, n2)} to the quantizer input (u(n1, n ~) } .</p><p>By definition of these impulse responses, we then have u(n1, 712) = 7, X [ g x ( n l -m1, nz -m2)2(m1, m2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ml m2 + gy(n1 -m1,nz -mz)y(m1,m2)] ( 2 )</formula><p>where the sums run from -cc to +cc. Even though the quantizer Q is nonlinear, the relationship (2) is linear. By inspection, g,(O, 0) = 1, gy(O, 0) = 0, and for (121,122) # (0, o), g,(nl,nz) + gy(nl,n2) = 0.' The summation limits in (2) can be reduced by making use of knowledge of the ROS's for the involved sequences. First, we have x(m1, mz) = 0 for (ml, mz) 6 R,. Second, we have the less obvious result that y(m1, m ~) = 0 for (ml, mz) 6 R,, as shown in Appendix A; this is a form of stability result because it follows from the boundedness of the quantization error. Finally, the ROS's of 'When using the standard CP, the quantizer input still depends linearly on encoder input and output.</p><p>the impulse responses can be calculated for given filter input and output masks. For instance, g, and gy for the masks shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> are both zero whenever n2 &lt; 0 or nl+nz &lt; 0. Putting these facts together, we find that for our particular ED encoder where MI = min{nl+ n~ -mz, N -l} and M2 = min(n2, N -1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM</head><p>Our proposed algorithm for halftone-to-contone conversion is based on the theory of POCS <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. We thus altemate between a space-domain projection PI onto a set S1 and a frequencydomain projection P 2 onto a set S 2 to find an image invariant under both. The set S1 contains all contone images that result in a specific, observed ED halftone image, and the set s 2 contains all band-limited contone images. The two sets are easily shown to be convex.2 To extract all information from an observed halftone image, we must find a signal 3 E SI n Sa.</p><p>According to the theory of POCS, such an element can be found from any initial guess 50 by the iteration <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref> zn+l = (P2 0 P1)zn, n 2 0 , k = P1k = Pzk = lim zn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>n-o3</head><p>In contrast, the traditional method of contone reconstruction is to apply a low-pass filter. This approach corresponds to enforcing the band limitation constraint and neglecting the space-domain constraint. In Sections 111-A and B, we describe the two projections in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Space-Domain Projection</head><p>In this section, we present a matrix space-domain description of the error diffusion encoder based on (3). We then show that the projection PI of an image onto the image set S 1 is a quadratic programming (QP) problem.</p><p>We only have access to the encoder output image (y(n1, nz)} and not the quantizer input sequence {u(nl,nz)}. Through (1) and (2), the halftone image thus provides us with a series of bounds on linear combinations of encoder input samples (2(nl,n2)} of the form -Go . . . iz(N -1, O), . . ., z ( N -1, Nl)}'</p><p>?./=(yo, " ' 1 yN2-l}t = (y(0, O), . . . , y(0, N -1)i</p><p>. . :y(N -1, 0), .. . , y ( N -1, Nl)}t where z t denotes the transpose of 2. We also define the N 2 x N2 block-Toeplitz lower-triangular matrix where the inequality sign is to be taken coordinate wise. The space-domain projection problem can now be stated as follows: Given an arbitrary image vector 2, find a vector 2 that satisfies (6) and minimizes the 2-norm distance (1 P --z 1 1 ;</p><p>. This is a linearly constrained QP problem that can be solved with techniques available in the literature [ 151. The QP problem is of the exact same form as the one stated in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> for EA encoding. Therefore, the methods described in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> for approximately solving the QP problem while drastically reducing computational complexity are directly applicable. Specifically, we can solve a number of QP subproblems of size LQP rather than one QP problem of size N 2 . We can also employ the idea described in [ 121 of overlapping QP subblocks in order to more closely approximate the solution to the actual N2-dimensional QP problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Frequency-Domain Projection</head><p>The fundamental mathematical requirement on the frequency-domain projection P 2 is that it should be a 2norm projection. Furthermore, for good performance, the projection should be able to discriminate between images and "nonimages." Unfortunately, no such operator is presently 3With the conventional CP for error diffusion, the halftone image still induces bounds on linear combinations of encoder input samples. However, the structure of the bounds is simplified by our modification.</p><p>known. There is no inherent requirement that the desired operator be a frequency-domain based one <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. However, we find a frequency-domain approach most attractive due to the approximate low-pass nature of many naturally occumng images <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>.</p><p>We have considered using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) as the basis of a projection. Specifically, we can take the 2-D DCT of an image, set all but the low-frequency coefficients to zero, and take an inverse DCT. We have also considered a novel linear singular value decomposition (SVD)-based transform [ 171. The SVD-based method for band limitation operates analogously to the DCT-based one and enjoys a certain maximal energy concentration property [ 171. As we found that the SVD-based method performed better than the DCT-based one while requiring fewer coefficients [13], we discarded the DCT-based method.</p><p>We also considered linear filtering [ 181 and replaced the frequency-domain projection with the 9 x 9 Gaussian filter given by h(n1,nz) = exp [(n; + n i ) / ( 2 u 2 ) ] / K , where -4 5 n1, nz 5 +4, (T is the width, and K is a normalization constant such that the tap values add up to one. As such linear filtering is not a projection, the theory of POCS does not guarantee convergence to an image invariant under both projections simultaneously, but subjectively good quality might nonetheless be achieved. Interestingly, the resulting iterative algorithm can actually be viewed as exactly solving an optimization problem associated with the space-and frequency-domain operators [ 191. The idea is that the output of the composition of the two operators converges, even though the output of the individual operators does not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we illustrate the performance of our reconstruction algorithm. We use the 512 x 512 Lenna image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> as our test case. For all POCS results, the QP block size for the space-domain projection is set to LQP = 64 with an overlap of 50% between blocks. Whenever the frequency-domain projection is SVD-based, it is calculated as described in Apendix B. The number of POCS iterations is ten; a significantly smaller number of iterations results in worse performance. The Peak SNR (PSNR) between two N x N images z and 2 is defined as -. 11.1 =o n2=0 Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the effect of bandlimiting the Lenna image using the SVD-based projection. We find that the subjective quality of Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> is close to that of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, although some detail is lost in the straws on the hat and in the hair falling down on the right. In addition, some ringing is introduced by the upper right edge of the hat brim. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> shows the halftoned version of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> from which the reconstruction is done. We have also considered halftoning the SVD-limited image rather than the original image in order to ensure that at least one image is invariant under both the space-and frequency-domain projections so that the theory of   POCS guarantees convergence. Such an approach would not be realistic in practice but would facilitate the investigation. We found that the results thus obtained were very close to the shown results.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the effect of low-pass filtering the halftone image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> using a Gaussian 9 x 9 filter with (T = 2.0. We find empirically that o = 2.0 results in the subjectively best low-pass filtering; choosing a larger (T results in a more blurred image, whereas choosing a smaller o results in a more Halftoned Lenna image filtered with a 9 x 9 Gaussian filter. The grainy appearance. Comparing Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, we see that linear filtering results in a visually pleasing but quite blurred image. Note for instance the blurring of the straws on the hat, the eyebrows, the eyes, and the upper brim of the hat. Note also the graininess of the left-most part of the cheek and the contouring in the background to the right of the cheek. The image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> is the benchmark against which we will compare the results of our reconstruction algorithm. Result of ten POCS iterations using the SVD as the band limitation.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows the result of applying the POCS algorithm to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> using the SVD-based method as the band limitation. The reconstruction is quite sharp and visually pleasing compared with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. In large magnification, however, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> exhibits some visually objectionable artifacts in the form of a grainy texture in the lower right part of the face. In addition, ringing is present along the upper right edge of the hat brim as in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Figs. 10 and 11</ref> show the results of applying the POCS algorithm with two different frequency-domain projections, both based on a 9 x 9 linear Gaussian filter whose 5 depends on the iteration number. The idea of varying 5 is inspired by <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. By starting with a large CT, the initial iterations become quite low-pass and blurred, thus filtering out the halftone artifacts. Subsequently, decreasing 5 reduces the effect of the filter. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>, we choose where n is the iteration number, and in Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>, we choose As expected, the image in Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> is somewhat more blurred than the one in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10 because ~</ref> ( n )  in ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is larger than ~( n ) in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>). On the other hand, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> has a "pearly" appearance, with white dots appearing along the edges of the hat among other places. We ascribe this to the fact that as 5 decreases, the effect of the filter also decreases, and therefore, the space-domain projection dominates the algorithm. As the space-domain projection is not restricted to make smooth modifications to the iterates, the local white dots arise. The pearliness is absent in Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> due to the smaller bandwidth suffer from the graininess of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. Using the POCS algorithm rather than linear filtering thus improves the reconstruction quality on both these counts. In addition, the filter used in the POCS iteration can be chosen to avoid pearly artifacts as discussed above.</p><p>Finally, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref> shows the result of applying the POCS algorithm with a mixed band limitation, namely, the linear filter characterized by (7), followed by the SVD-based method. The purpose of this is to combine the best of the SVD method and linear filtering for band limitation, namely, the convergence and sharpness properties of the SVD method and the smoothing effect of linear filtering. We find the image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref> to be subjectively pleasing. The main artifacts of the image are in the white dots on the chin and the dark shade to the right of the nose. In addition, there is some graininess in the facial skin. On the other hand, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref> is sharper than Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> 1. We find that although Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref> is a good reconstruction, the best reconstructed image shown in this section is Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>.</p><p>To give some quantitative measure of the convergence rates involved in the above reconstructions, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref> shows the energy modification due to the frequency-domain projection as a function of iteration number for four variations on the frequency-domain projection, namely, the pure SVD method, linear filtering based on (7) and on (8), and the mixed band limitation. As expected, the pure SVD method has the best convergence curve. The other three frequency-domain operations all have about the same convergence performance. Neither of these curves correspond to converging algorithms, as linear filtering is not a projection. We emphasize that although it is mathematically desirable for an reconstruction algorithm to converge, an image processing algorithm should be judged primarily on its visual qualities and secondarily on strict convergence properties.  The subjective reconstruction quality of the presented images is tabulated in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. In summary, low-pass filtering can be used on its own as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, but this results in either graininess or blurriness, depending on the filter bandwidth. In contrast, Figs. 10 and 1 1 show the effect of linear filtering in a POCS iteration; the blurriness is clearly reduced, but pearliness results if the filter bandwidth is too large. Using the SVD method in a POCS iteration also reduces blurriness and results in fast convergence but introduces some ringing artifacts. Finally, in our opinion, a combination of the SVD method and linear filtering in a POCS iteration results in a reasonable compromise between sharpness and artifact-free images, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SUMMARY</head><p>We have described a POCS-based iterative algorithm for reconstructing a contone image from its ED-encoded version. We showed simulation results that demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides subjectively superior reconstruction to conventional linear filtering.</p><p>Alhtough this paper presents the mathematical framework for our algorithm and demonstrates its feasibility, it does not provide definitive answers to the contone reconstruction problem. Our conclusions are thus tentative and require psychovisual test for verification. In addition, the behavior of the algorithm with a number of different error diffusion filters could fruitfully be examined. Other questions include the optimal design of ED filters in the context of the presented algorithm and the problem of reconstruction when the ED filter is unknown. Reducing' the computational complexity of the algorithm, particularly the space-domain projection, is also an interesting problem. The techniques presented in [20] may be relevant in this respect. Finally, the absence of a completely satisfactory frequency-domain projection is a problem whose solution would have implications not only for our algorithm but for other applications 2s well.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FigFig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B TWO-DIMENSIONAL SVD BAND LIMITATION</head><p>In this appendix, we describe the generalization to two dimensions of the SVD-based band limitation method presented in <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> for 1-D signals. As in <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>, we denote the 1 -D truncated discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS's) corresponding to a particular bandwidth and sample size N by { u c , , . . . , UN-1). The SVD transform {X(ml, mz)} of an image (z(n1, n2)} is then given by with the inversion formula The image (x(n1, nz)} can be bandlimited by restricting the summation limits in (12). In the special case of a separable band limitation, that is, if the summation limits on ml and m2 are independent, the image {z(nl, n 2 ) ) can be bandlimited successively in the two dimensions as follows: This is the form in which we will use the SVD band limitation. The method is characterized by the bandwidth, the sample size N defining the DPSS's, and the number of vectors T .</p><p>Unlike most 1-D signals, there is no natural bandwidth for a given image; therefore, choosing the bandwidth must be done empirically. We find that a bandwidth oversampling factor [ 171 of 2.5 and a number T = 210 of singular vectors gives adequate results for an image size of N x N = 512 x 512.</p><p>ACKNOWLEDGMENT ing the problem and useful discussions.  <ref type="bibr">, Cambridge, all in electrical engineering, in 1983</ref><ref type="bibr">, Cambridge, all in electrical engineering, in , 1985</ref><ref type="bibr">, Cambridge, all in electrical engineering, in , and 1987, respectively. , respectively.</ref> In 1988, she joined the Faculty at University of California at Berkeley, where she is currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.
