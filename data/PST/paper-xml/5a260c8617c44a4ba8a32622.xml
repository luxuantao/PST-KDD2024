<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R ADIO frequency (RF) transmission enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising solution to provide perpetual and cost-effective energy supplies to lowpower electronic devices, and it is anticipated to have abundant applications in future Internet-of-things (IoT) wireless networks (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and the references therein). In conventional WPT systems, dedicated energy transmitters (ETs) are usually deployed at fixed locations to send RF signals to charge distributed energy receivers (ERs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> such as low-power sensors or IoT devices. However, due to the severe propagation loss of RF signals over long distance, the performance of practical WPT systems for wide coverage range is fundamentally constrained by the low endto-end power transmission efficiency. As a consequence, in order to provide ubiquitous wireless energy accessibility for massive low-power ERs distributed in a large area, fixedlocation ETs need to be deployed in an ultra-dense manner. This, however, would tremendously increase the cost, and thus hinder the large-scale implementation of future WPT systems. In the literature, various approaches have been proposed aiming to alleviate this issue by enhancing the WPT efficiency at the link level, including multi-antenna energy beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, energy scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and energy waveform optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Different from these prior studies, in this paper we tackle this problem from a fundamentally new perspective at the system level, i.e., we propose a radically novel architecture for WPT systems by utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile ETs.</p><p>UAV has drawn significant research interests recently due to its wide range of applications, including surveillance and monitoring, aerial radar and camera, cargo delivery, communication platforms, etc. Particularly, mounted with miniaturized communication transceivers, low-altitude UAVs can be used as aerial mobile base stations (BSs) or relays to help enhance the performance of terrestrial wireless communication systems (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and the references therein). By optimizing the UAV's trajectory jointly with communication scheduling, the air-to-ground link distances between the UAV and its served ground users can be effectively shortened, thus significantly improving the system throughput <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by UAV-assisted wireless communications, in this paper we propose a new UAV-enabled WPT architecture as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. With the proposed architecture, a group of UAVs are dispatched as mobile ETs that fly above the serving area to cooperatively charge a set of distributed ERs on the ground. We assume that these ERs have fixed locations that are a priori known for the UAV trajectory design. By exploiting the fully controllable mobility of the UAVs via trajectory design, the proposed system is expected to significantly improve the WPT performance, while reducing the number of required ETs as compared to the conventional WPT systems with ETs deployed at fixed locations. Notice that there have been some prior works (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>) that considered the use of moving ground vehicles as mobile charging stations to wirelessly charge sensor nodes. Different from ground vehicles that have only limited mobility in a two-dimensional (2D) area usually with a large number of ground obstacles, UAVs can be more flexibly deployed and moved in the three-dimensional (3D) free space. Furthermore, compared to terrestrial wireless channels that typically suffer from various impairments such as shadowing and fading in addition to path loss, UAVs usually possess better channels to ground ERs due to the higher chance of having moderate-distance line-of-sight (LoS) links with them.</p><p>A fundamental question to be addressed for the proposed UAV-enabled WPT systems is as follows: how to jointly optimize the trajectories of multiple UAVs so as to maximize the energy transferred to all ERs in a fair manner? This question, however, has not yet been studied in the literature to our best knowledge, and it is non-trivial to be addressed, even for the simplest scenario with one UAV and two ERs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Notice that in this basic setup, the transferred power from the UAV to the two ERs critically depends on the UAV's trajectory or locations at different time. For example, when the UAV moves from one ER to the other, their received power will decrease and increase, respectively, thus resulting in an interesting power trade-off between them.</p><p>For the purpose of exposition, in this paper we focus on the UAV-enabled multiuser WPT system with one UAV/ET and K &gt; 1 ERs, while leaving the general scenario with more than one UAVs/ETs for our future work. Under the considered setup, we aim to find the optimal UAV trajectory to maximize the amount of energy transferred to the K ERs during a finite charging period, subject to the UAV's maximum speed constraint. To our best knowledge, this work is the first that explores the UAV's trajectory design for WPT performance optimization. The main results of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>First, we consider the UAV's trajectory optimization in the horizontal plane with a fixed altitude above the ground to maximize the sum received energy of all ERs. Despite that this problem is non-convex and involves an infinite number of variables, we derive its optimal solution, which shows that the UAV should hover at one single fixed optimal location during the whole charging period, and the optimal hovering location can be obtained via a 2D exhaustive search. In particular, we obtain the optimal hovering location in closed-form for the special case with K = 2 ERs. It is shown that when the distance between the two ERs is smaller than a certain threshold, the optimal hovering location is exactly above the middle point between the two ERs; whereas when their distance is larger than the threshold, the optimal hovering location is closer to one ER than the other. In general, the sum-energy maximization with the optimal fixed hovering location incurs a severe "near-far" fairness issue, especially for a network spanning over a large area, as the near ERs in close proximity to the UAV can receive significantly more energy than the far-away ERs.</p><p>Next, to resolve the fairness issue, we consider an alternative problem to maximize the minimum received energy among all ERs via trajectory optimization. This problem is more challenging to solve than the previous sum-energy maximization. To obtain useful insight and a performance upper bound, we first consider an ideal case by assuming that the UAV maximum speed constraint can be ignored. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> In this case, the problem is shown to satisfy the so-called time-sharing condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and thus can be optimally solved via the Lagrange dual method. The obtained optimal solution reveals that the UAV should hover over an optimal set of fixed locations, with optimal hovering time allocations among them. For the special case of K = 2 ERs, the closed-form solution is also obtained and compared against that for sum-energy maximization.</p><p>Last, we consider the above min-energy maximization problem for the general case with the UAV's maximum speed constraint considered. Inspired by the optimal multilocation-hovering solution in the ideal case, we propose a successive hover-and-fly trajectory design, where the UAV successively hovers at a given set of hovering locations (e.g., using the optimal set of hovering locations obtained in the ideal case if the charging duration is sufficiently large) each for a certain duration, and flies with the maximum speed between these hovering locations. The total flying time is minimized by finding the path with the shortest traveling distance to visit all of these hovering locations. The proposed trajectory is proved to be optimal for the case of K = 2, and also asymptotically optimal for K &gt; 2 if the charging duration is sufficiently large so that the total flying time becomes asymptotically negligible. Furthermore, we also propose a successive convex programming (SCP)based algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution to the min-energy maximization problem with K &gt; 2. By employing the successive fly-and-hover trajectory as the initial point, the SCP-based algorithm iteratively refines the UAV trajectory to improve the max-min energy of all ERs until convergence.</p><p>It is worth noting that in the preliminary work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we considered the UAV-enabled WPT system in the case with K = 2 ERs and characterized the achievable region of the received energy by the two ERs via UAV trajectory optimization; while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we studied the min-energy maximization for the case with K &gt; 2 ERs. Different from the above two prior studies, this paper studies both the sum-energy and min-energy maximization problems for the general case with K ≥ 2 ERs, and provides more comprehensive analysis, simulations, and discussions.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the system model of the UAV-enabled WPT system. Section III presents the optimal solution to the sum-energy maximization problem. Section IV presents the optimal solution to the min-energy maximization problem when the UAV maximum speed constraint is ignored. Section V presents the proposed solutions to the min-energy maximization problem with the maximum UAV speed constraint considered. Section VI provides numerical results to validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory designs. Finally, Section VII concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>We consider a UAV-enabled multiuser WPT system, where a UAV is dispatched to deliver wireless energy to K ≥ 2 ERs located on the ground. Let K {1, . . . , K} denote the set of ERs. Each ER k ∈ K has a fixed location on the ground, denoted by (x k , y k , 0) in a 3D Euclidean coordinate, which is assumed to be known to the UAV a priori for its trajectory design. We consider a finite charging period with duration T , denoted by T [0, T ]. At each time instant t ∈ T , the UAV is assumed to fly at a fixed altitude H &gt; 0 above the ground, whose time-varying location is denoted as (x(t), y(t), H). We assume that the initial and final UAV locations at time t = 0 and t = T are not pre-determined, but can be freely optimized. 2 Denote by V in meter/second (m/s) the maximum possible speed of the UAV. We then have the maximum speed constraint at each time instant expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">√ ẋ2 (t) + ẏ2 (t) ≤ V, ∀t ∈ T ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with ẋ(t) and ẏ(t) denoting the time-derivatives of x(t) and y(t), respectively. We assume that the wireless channel between the UAV and each ER is LoS-dominated, so that the free-space path loss model similarly as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is adopted. At time t ∈ T , the channel power gain from the UAV to ER</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">k ∈ K is modeled as h k (t) = β 0 d -2 k (t), where d k (t) = √ (x(t) -x k ) 2 + (y(t) -y k ) 2 + H 2</formula><p>is their distance and β 0 denotes the channel power gain at a reference distance of d 0 = 1 m. Assuming that the UAV has a constant transmit 2 This assumption is made simply for the purpose of exposition, while our proposed algorithms in Section V can be easily modified to incorporate the initial and/or final location constraints.</p><p>power P , the received RF power by ER k at time t is thus given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Q k (x(t), y(t)) = h k (t)P = β 0 P (x(t) -x k ) 2 + (y(t) -y k ) 2 + H 2 .</formula><p>(</p><p>The total energy received by each ER k ∈ K over the whole charging period is a function of the UAV's trajectory {x(t), y(t)}, which can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E k ({x(t), y(t)}) = ∫ T 0 Q k (x(t), y(t))dt. (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>Note that at each ER, the received RF signals are converted into direct current (DC) signals for energy harvesting via rectifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In practice, the RF-to-DC conversion is generally non-linear and the conversion efficiency critically depends on the received RF power and waveform at the ER (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). To the authors' best knowledge, a generic model to accurately characterize the non-linear RF-to-DC conversion efficiency is not available yet, but in general the harvested DC power monotonically increases with the received RF power. Therefore, for simplicity, in this paper we consider the received RF power in (2) and the resultant received energy in (3) by ERs prior to RF-to-DC conversion as the performance metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SUM-ENERGY MAXIMIZATION</head><p>In this section, we consider the maximization of the sum received energy of all ERs over the charging period, by optimizing the UAV's trajectory {x(t), y(t)} subject to the speed constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The problem can be expressed as (P1) : max</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">{x(t),y(t)} ∑ k∈K E k ({x(t), y(t)}) s.t. (1).</formula><p>Problem (P1) involves an infinite number of optimization variables, i.e., x(t)'s and y(t)'s over continuous time t. Furthermore, (P1) is a non-convex optimization problem as the objective function is a non-concave function with respect to the trajectory {x(t), y(t)}. Therefore, (P1) is generally difficult to be optimally solved. In the following, we first present the optimal solution to (P1) for the general case with arbitrary value of K ≥ 2 in Section III-A, and then consider (P1) for the special case with K = 2 in Section III-B to draw more insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optimal Solution to Problem (P1)</head><p>For the ease of description, given the UAV's location x(t) and y(t) at a given time t, we define the sum-power received by all the K ERs as ψ(x(t), y(t))</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∑ k∈K Q k (x(t), y(t)) = ∑ k∈K β 0 P (x(t) -x k ) 2 + (y(t) -y k ) 2 + H 2 .

(<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>As the function ψ(x, y) is non-concave with respect to x and y, it is generally difficult to find the closed-form expression of x ⋆ and y ⋆ . Fortunately, ψ(x, y) in problem (6) only has two variables x and y. Besides, it is not difficult to show that x ⋆ and y ⋆ should satisfy x ≤ x ⋆ ≤ x and y ≤ y ⋆ ≤ y, respectively, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">x = min k∈K x k , x = max k∈K x k , y = min k∈K y k , y = max k∈K y k .

As a result, we can adopt a 2D exhaustive search over the box region [x, x] × [y, y] to find (x ⋆ , y ⋆ ). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> Notice that the optimal solution of x ⋆ and y ⋆ to problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">6</ref>) is generally nonunique.</p><p>Given x ⋆ and y ⋆ , we have the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 3.1: The optimal trajectory solution to problem (P1) is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">x ⋆ (t) = x ⋆ , y ⋆ (t) = y ⋆ , ∀t ∈ T . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>Proof: See Appendix A.</p><p>Proposition 3.1 indicates that the UAV should hover at one single fixed location (x ⋆ , y ⋆ , H) during the whole charging period, referred to as single-location hovering. Due to the non-uniqueness of the optimal solution x ⋆ and y ⋆ to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, such an optimal hovering location (x ⋆ , y ⋆ , H) is non-unique in general, as will be shown in an example given in the next subsection for the case of K = 2. However, this single-location-hovering solution can lead to a severe "near-far" fairness issue in multiuser WPT, as the near ERs in close proximity to the optimal hovering location can receive significantly more energy than the far ERs, especially in a large network with many ERs that are sufficiently separated from each other. To overcome this issue, in Section IV we will consider an alternative problem formulation to maximize the minimum received energy among all ERs to ensure their fairness. Before that, in the following subsection, we derive the optimal solution to problem (P1) in closed-form for the special case of K = 2 ERs to provide more insights on the sum-energy maximization problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Special Case with K = 2 ERs</head><p>In the special case with K = 2, without loss of generality we assume x 1 = -D/2, x 2 = D/2, and y 1 = y 2 = 0, where D denotes the distance between the two ERs. Based on Proposition 3.1, in this case, the UAV should hover at a fixed location (x ⋆ , y ⋆ , H) above the line between the two ERs with y ⋆ = 0. Therefore, it only remains to find x ⋆ .</p><p>Towards this end, we first re-express the received power by ER 1 and ER 2 as follows, given the UAV's location (x, 0, H).</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Q1 (x) = β 0 P (x + D/2) 2 + H 2 , (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">Q2 (x) = β 0 P (x -D/2) 2 + H 2 . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>Accordingly, the function ψ(x, y) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">4</ref>) can be simplified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">ψ(x) 2 ∑ k=1 Qk (x) = β 0 P ( 1 (x + D/2) 2 + H 2 + 1 (x -D/2) 2 + H 2</formula><p>) .</p><p>(11) As a result, finding x ⋆ is equivalent to determining the maximizer of ψ(x), i.e., x ⋆ = arg max x ψ(x).</p><p>Lemma 3.1: The function ψ(x) has the following properties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">• It is symmetric over x = 0, i.e., ψ(-x) = ψ(x), ∀x ∈ (-∞, ∞). • When D ≤ 2H/ √ 3, ψ(x)</formula><p>is monotonically increasing over x ∈ (-∞, 0) and decreasing over x ∈ (0, ∞); hence, x ⋆ = 0 is the unique maximizer of ψ(x).</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">• When D &gt; 2H/ √ 3, there exists a value ξ √ -(D 2 /4 + H 2 ) + √ D 4 /4 + H 2 D 2 &lt; D/2, (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>such that ψ(x) is monotonically increasing, decreasing, increasing and decreasing over x ∈ (-∞, -ξ), (-ξ, 0), (0, ξ) and (ξ, ∞), respectively; hence, together with the symmetry of the function ψ(x) over x = 0, it follows that x ⋆ = -ξ and x ⋆ = ξ are the two equivalent maximizers of ψ(x).</p><p>Proof: See Appendix B. Based on Lemma 3.1, the optimal solution x ⋆ to maximize ψ(x) is found. By using this result together with Proposition 3.1, we have the following proposition to solve (P1) for K = 2.</p><p>Proposition 3.2: In the special case of K = 2, the optimal solution to (P1) is given as follows.</p><p>• When D ≤ 2H/ √ 3, we have x ⋆ (t) = 0, y ⋆ (t) = 0, ∀t ∈ T , i.e., the UAV should hover at the fixed location (0, 0, H) above the middle point between the two ERs during the whole charging period.</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">• When D &gt; 2H/ √</formula><p>3, there are two symmetric optimal solutions to (P1), given by x ⋆ (t) = -ξ, y ⋆ (t) = 0, ∀t ∈ T , and x ⋆ (t) = ξ, y ⋆ (t) = 0, ∀t ∈ T , respectively. In other words, the UAV should hover at either (-ξ, 0, H) near ER 1 or (ξ, 0, H) near ER 2 during the whole charging period.</p><p>For illustration, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the optimal hovering location x ⋆ , with x ⋆ (t) = x ⋆ , ∀t ∈ T , versus the distance D between the two ERs in the case of H = 5 m. It is observed that x ⋆ = 0 when D ≤ 2H/ √ 3 = 5.77 m and 0 &lt; x ⋆ &lt; D/2 (or equivalently -D/2 &lt; -x ⋆ &lt; 0 for the other symmetric optimal hovering location) when D &gt; 2H/ √ 3. It is also observed that as D increases, x ⋆ becomes closer and eventually converges to D/2. These observations are consistent with Proposition 3.2. Furthermore, notice that it follows from (12) that lim D→∞ x ⋆ = lim D→∞ ξ = D/2, which can be intuitively explained as follows. When the distance between the two ERs is sufficiently large, the UAV should hover above one of the two ERs to maximize the transferred energy to it, which in turn maximizes the sumenergy transferred to both ERs. In this case, the energy transferred to the other ER becomes negligible. This thus leads to a severe near-far fairness issue between the two ERs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MIN-ENERGY MAXIMIZATION WITHOUT UAV SPEED CONSTRAINT</head><p>To overcome the aforementioned fairness issue in the sum-energy maximization, we consider an alternative performance metric, namely the min-energy maximization. Specifically, we maximize the minimum received energy among all the K ERs via optimizing the UAV's trajectory {x(t), y(t)}, subject to the maximum speed constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Constructing Optimal Primal Solution to (P3.1):</head><p>Based on the optimal dual solution {λ * k } to (D3.1), we need to obtain the optimal primal solution to (P3.1), denoted by {x * (t)}, {y * (t)}, and E * .

In the latter case, we need to time-share among these non-unique optimal solutions as follows to construct the optimal primal solution {x * (t)}, {y * (t)}, and E * to (P3.1).</p><p>Under the optimal dual solution {λ * k }, suppose that problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_45">[x, x] × [y, y]. Let Q k (x *</formula><p>γ , y * γ ) denote the corresponding received power at each ER k ∈ K when the UAV stays at the location (x * γ , y * γ , H). Due to the zero duality gap between (P3.1) and (D3.1), it is evident that for any time t ∈ [0, T ], the optimal primal solution of (x * (t), y * (t)) must be chosen from the Γ hovering locations. Notice that when the UAV hovers at the same location at different time t, the ERs will receive the same amount of power. Therefore, we only need to decide the time-sharing ratio among the Γ solutions for constructing the optimal primal solution to (P3.1). Here, time-sharing means that the UAV should hover at each of these different locations for a certain portion of the total duration T . Let τ γ denote the optimal hovering duration at (x * γ , y * γ , H). Then, the optimal τ * γ 's, together with the maximum min-energy E * , can be obtained by solving the following problem.</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">max {τγ ≥0},E E s.t.

Special Case with K = 2 ERs</head><p>To provide more insights, in this subsection we consider the min-energy maximization in the special case with K = 2 ERs, by assuming x 1 = -D/2, x 2 = D/2, and y 1 = y 2 = 0, similarly as in Section III-B.

Proof: See Appendix C. By comparing Proposition 4.2 versus Proposition 3.2, it is observed that in the case with K = 2 ERs, each of the optimal hovering locations for the min-energy maximization is also optimal for the corresponding case in the sum-energy maximization. Thus, the achieved sumenergy in problem (P3-2ER) is identical to that in (P1) when K = 2. This implies that without the maximum UAV speed constraint, the multi-location-hovering solution to (P3-2ER) can maximize the sum-energy received by the two ERs, while ensuring their energy fairness thanks to the time sharing. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that in the general case with K &gt; 2, the optimal hovering locations for (P3) are generally different from that for (P1). This is due to the fact that x ⋆ and y ⋆ are the maximizer of the sumpower ψ(x, y), but x * γ 's and y * γ 's are the maximizers of the weighted sum-power ψ{λ k } (x(t), y(t)), which is different from ψ(x, y) if any two λ k 's are not identical in the case of K &gt; 2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Successive Hover-and-Fly Trajectory Design for Problem (P2)</head><p>In this subsection, we propose a successive hover-andfly trajectory design to solve problem (P2) based on the optimal solution obtained for (P3) in the ideal case. Recall that the optimal solution to (P3) corresponds to Γ optimal hovering locations, i.e., {(x * γ , y * γ , H)} Γ γ=1 . In the proposed trajectory design with the maximum speed constraint, the UAV sequentially hovers at each of these locations for a certain duration and flies from one location to another with the maximum speed V . As a result, to find the optimal successive hover-and-fly trajectory, we need to first determine the UAV's traveling path to visit all the Γ locations with the minimum flying distance so as to minimize the total flying time, and then optimize the hovering time at each of these locations for the remaining time in the charging duration.</p><p>1) Flying Distance Minimization to Visit Γ Hovering Locations: First, we determine the UAV's traveling path to visit all the Γ hovering locations with the minimum flying distance. For ease of description, let The flying distance minimization problem considered here is reminiscent of the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP) (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), with the following difference. In the standard TSP, the salesman (or equivalently the UAV of our interest) needs to return to the origin city (the initial hovering location) after visiting all these cities (or hovering locations here); but our flying distance minimization problem does not have such a requirement since the initial and final hovering locations can be optimized. Fortunately, it has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> that our flying distance minimization problem can be transformed to the standard TSP as follows. First, we add a dummy hovering location, namely the (Γ + 1)-th hovering location, whose distances to all the existing Γ hovering locations are 0, i.e., d Γ+1,γ = d γ,Γ+1 = 0, ∀γ ∈ {1, . . . , Γ}. Note that this dummy hovering location is a virtual node that does not exist physically. Then, we obtain the desirable traveling path by solving the standard TSP problem for the Γ + 1 hovering locations, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> and then removing the two edges associated with the dummy location. For the obtained traveling path, we define the permutation π(•) over the set {1, . . . , Γ}, such that the UAV first visits the π(1)-th hovering location, followed by the π(2)-th, the π(3)-th, until the π(Γ)-th hovering location at last. In this case, the resulting flying distance and flying duration with the maximum speed V are given as D fly = ∑ Γ-1 γ=1 d π(γ),π(γ+1) , and T fly = D fly /V , respectively. We denote the corresponding trajectory as {x(t), ŷ(t)} Tfly t=0 . It is worth noting that the above traveling path is only feasible when the charging duration T is no smaller than T fly , i.e., T ≥ T fly , since otherwise the charging duration is not sufficient for the UAV to visit all the Γ hovering locations. In the following, we first determine the hovering time allocation over different locations in the case with T ≥ T fly , and then refine the trajectory design in the case with T &lt; T fly .</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">d γ,ζ √ (x * γ -x * ζ ) 2 + (y * γ -y * ζ ) 2 denote</formula><p>2) Hovering Time Allocation When T ≥ T fly : First, we consider the case when T ≥ T fly . With the above traveling path {x(t), ŷ(t)} Tfly t=0 , the trajectory design problem remains to allocate the hovering duration T -T fly among the Γ locations to maximize the min-energy transferred to all the K ERs. Note that based on the traveling path {x(t), ŷ(t)} Tfly t=0 , we can obtain the received energy by each ER k ∈ K during the UAV's flying time as</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">E fly k = ∫ Tfly 0 Q k (x(t), ŷ(t))dt, with Q k (•, •) given in (2). Also, recall that Q k (x *</formula><p>γ , y * γ ) denotes the received power at ER k ∈ K when the UAV hovers at the location (x * γ , y * γ , H). Then the optimal hovering durations, denoted as τ * * γ 's, together with the corresponding maximum min-energy of the K ERs, denoted by E * * , can be obtained by solving the following LP.</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">max {τγ ≥0},E E s.t.

(<label>25</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_57">)</formula><p>With the optimal permutation π(•) and the optimal hovering durations {τ * * γ } obtained, the successive hoverand-fly trajectory is finalized, which can be summarized as follows. By dividing the charging period into 2Γ -1 slots; in the (2γ -1)-th slot with duration τ * * π(γ) , γ ∈ {1, . . . , Γ}, the UAV hovers at the π(γ)-th hovering location (x * π(γ) , y * π(γ) , H); and in the (2γ)-th slot, γ ∈ {1, . . . , Γ -1}, the UAV flies from the π(γ)-th hovering location (x * π(γ) , y * π(γ) , H) to the π(γ + 1)-th hovering location (x * π(γ+1) , y * π(γ+1) , H) with its maximum speed V . Proposition 5.1: When the charging duration T is sufficiently large such that T ≫ T fly , the successive hover-andfly trajectory design is asymptotically optimal for problem (P2).</p><p>Proof: When T ≫ T fly , the flying time is negligible and thus the successive hover-and-fly trajectory is equivalent to the optimal multi-location-hovering solution to (P3). In this case, the objective value achieved by the successive hover-and-fly trajectory for (P2) is asymptotically approaching the optimal value of (P3), which actually serves as the upper bound for that of (P2). Therefore, the proposed trajectory design is asymptotically optimal for (P2) when T ≫ T fly .</p><p>3) Trajectory Redesign When T &lt; T fly : In this subsection, we consider the case when T &lt; T fly . In this case, the UAV traveling path {x(t), ŷ(t)} Tfly t=0 based on the TSP solution is no longer feasible since the charging time is not sufficient for the UAV to visit all the Γ hovering locations. To address this issue, we first find the solution to (P2) when T is sufficiently small (i.e., T → 0) such that the UAV can only hover at one single location, and then reconstruct a modified successive hover-and-fly trajectory for the case of T &lt; T fly .</p><p>First, when T → 0, the UAV should hover at one single fixed location, denoted by (x fix , y fix , H), where x fix and y fix can be obtained by solving the following problem via a 2D exhaustive search over (x, x) × (y, y).</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">(x fix , y fix ) = arg max x,y min k∈K Q k (x, y).

Remark 5.1: Proposition 5.2 provides important insights on how to maximize the minimum or equal energy transferred to the two ERs. First, when the two ERs are close to each other with D ≤ 2H/ √ 3, the UAV hovers at one fixed location (0, 0, H) during the whole charging period, and this solution is also optimal for problem (P1) to maximize the sum-energy of the two ERs (see Proposition 3.2). Next, consider the case when the two ERs are located farther apart with D &gt; 2H/ √ 3. If the charging duration is short (i.e., T ≤ 2ξ/V ), then the UAV should keep flying at its maximum speed from one ER to the other by following a symmetric trajectory around the middle point (0, 0, H), without hovering over any of them due to the insufficient charging time. On the other hand, if the charging duration is sufficiently long (i.e., T &gt; 2ξ/V ), then the UAV should hover at the two symmetric locations (-ξ, 0, H) and (ξ, 0, H) with equal time and travel from one location to the other with the maximum speed. The optimal trajectory in this case is different from that for sum-energy maximization in Proposition 3.2, where the UAV should hover at only one fixed location (-ξ, 0, H) or (ξ, 0, H) for all the time. Therefore, the fairness is achieved by the UAV traveling between different hovering locations, though a certain loss in the total energy transferred to the two ERs is incurred.</p></div>

SCP-Based Trajectory Design for Problem (P2)</head><p>In this subsection, we develop an alternative SCP-based algorithm to find a locally optimal solution to problem (P2).

With the SCP-based trajectory design, we first discretize the whole charging duration into a finite number of N time slots, each with duration ∆ = T /N . Note that the duration ∆ is chosen to be sufficiently small, such that we can assume that the UAV location is approximately unchanged during each slot n, which is denoted as (x[n], y[n], H), n ∈ N {1, . . . , N }. In this case, the received energy by each ER k ∈ K at slot n is given by Accordingly, the min-energy maximization problem (P2) over the continuous trajectory {x(t), y(t)} can be reformulated as follows over the discretized trajectory variables {x</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">Êk (x[n], y[n]) = β 0 P ∆ (x[n] -x k ) 2 + (y[n] -y k ) 2 + H 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we provide numerical results to evaluate the performance of our proposed trajectory designs. In the simulation, we set β 0 = -30 dB, H = 5 m, and P = 40 dBm. For all simulations given below, we consider the average received power by the ER, which is obtained by normalizing the total received energy by the charging duration T .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sum-Energy Maximization</head><p>This subsection evaluates the performance of our proposed optimal solution for the sum-energy maximization problem (P1). First, we consider the case with K = 2 ERs, where x 1 = -D/2, x 2 = D/2, and y 1 = y 2 = 0, with D denoting the distance between the two ERs. Note that Proposition 3.2 indicates that when D &gt; 2H/ √ 3 = 5.77 m, there are two optimal single-location-hovering solutions to (P1). In the simulation, we choose the one with x ⋆ (t) = -ξ, y ⋆ (t) = 0, ∀t ∈ T (with ξ given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">12</ref>)), such that the single hovering location is closer to ER 1 than ER 2. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the average received power versus D. When 0 ≤ D ≤ 2H/ √ 3, it is observed that the average received power by ER 1 or ER 2 is identical. This is because in this case, the optimal solution is obtained by letting the UAV hover above the middle point between the two ERs during the whole charging period (see Proposition 3.2). On the other hand, when D &gt; 2H/ √ 3, it is observed that as D increases, the average received power by ER 1 (the ER closer to the UAV) increases, while that by ER 2 (the ER farther away from the UAV) decreases. This is due to the fact that as D increases in this case, the optimal hovering location (selected in this example) becomes closer to ER 1. Accordingly, the average sum received power of the two ERs is dominated by the received power of ER 1, and the near-far fairness issue becomes more severe as D becomes larger.</p><p>Next, we consider a UAV-enabled WPT system with K = 10 ERs, whose locations are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. In this figure, the green triangle indicates the optimal hovering location for sum-energy maximization (i.e., (x ⋆ , y ⋆ , H) given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">6</ref>)). It is observed that this hovering location is close to ERs 7-10, but far away from other ERs, especially  ER 1. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the corresponding average received power by each individual ER. It is observed that ERs 7-10 receive much higher energy than the other ERs, which illustrates the near-far fairness issue in the sum-energy maximization for this multiuser WPT system with more than two ERs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Min-Energy Maximization</head><p>In this subsection, we evaluate the performance of our proposed trajectory designs for the min-energy maximization problem (P2). First, we consider the case with K = 2 ERs. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows the average received power by each ER with the optimal trajectory obtained by solving problem (P2-2ER), with different values of the maximum UAV V and the charging duration T . It is observed that when D ≤ 2H/ √ 3 = 5.77m, the static UAV design (with V = 0) achieves the same performance as the mobile UAV design, regardless of V and T . By contrast, when D &gt; 5.77m, the proposed mobile UAV design achieves higher received power than the static UAV design (with the UAV fixed at (0, 0, H)), and the performance gain becomes more pronounced as D increases. Furthermore, it is observed that as the UAV's maximum speed V increases, the average max-min received power by the ERs increases, as the traveling time between the two ERs becomes less significant.</p><p>Next, we consider the min-energy maximization problem for the UAV-enabled WPT system in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> with K = 10 ERs. Note that besides the single-location-hovering solution for the sum-energy maximization problem (P1), Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> also shows the multi-location-hovering solution for problem (P3) without the UAV speed constraint, as well as the proposed successive hover-and-fly trajectory design and the SCP-based trajectory design for problem (P2) with the UAV speed constraint considered, by assuming T = 20s. First, it is observed that there are Γ = 4 optimal hovering locations for the min-energy maximization problem (P3), which are close to ERs 1-2, ER 3, ERs 4-6, and ERs 7-10, respectively. This clearly shows that when the ERs are close to each other (e.g., ERs 7-10), then the UAV should hover above one single location above them for charging them more efficiently. It is also observed that the SCP-based trajectory design and the successive hoverand-fly trajectory design both visit the Γ optimal hovering locations. Furthermore, it is observed that the SCP-based trajectory in general deviates from the successive hoverand-fly trajectory when flying from one hovering location to another. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the max-min average power received by all ERs in the 10-ER WPT system in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> versus the charging duration T , for our proposed trajectory designs, as compared to the following two benchmark schemes.</p><p>• Single-location hovering for minimum energy maximization: During the whole charging period, the UAV hovers at a fixed location (x fix , y fix , H) obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. • Successive hover-and-fly over all ERs: In this successive hover-and-fly scheme, instead of optimizing the UAV's hovering locations, they are simply set as the K locations above the K ERs. This scheme can be implemented by using Algorithm 2 via replacing {(x * γ , y * γ , H)} Γ γ=1 as {(x k , y k , H)} K k=1 . In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, the upper bound corresponds to the optimal value achieved by (P3) with the UAV's maximum speed constraints ignored. It is observed that the two proposed trajectory designs, namely the successive hover-and-fly and the SCP-based trajectory designs, outperform the singlelocation-hovering design, and achieve higher average maxmin average power as T becomes large. When T ≥ 15 s, the proposed successive hover-and-fly and the SCPbased trajectory designs also outperform the successive hover-and-fly trajectory over all the ERs. Furthermore, it is observed that the SCP-based trajectory achieves better performance than the successive hover-and-fly trajectory, and converges to the upper bound, when T becomes large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>This paper studies a new UAV-enabled multiuser WPT system. We exploit the mobility of the UAV to maximize the energy transferred to all ERs over a given charging period by optimizing the UAV's trajectory under its practical speed constraint. First, we consider the sum-energy maximization of all ERs and obtain the optimal solution to this problem, which shows that the UAV should hover at only one fixed location during the whole charging period. However, this single-location-hovering solution may lead to unfair performance among ERs due to their different distances from the UAV. To achieve fairness among all ERs, we consider an alternative problem to maximize the minimum energy transferred to all ERs. We first consider the relaxed problem by ignoring the UAV speed constraints and derive the optimal solution, which shows that the UAV should hover over multiple fixed locations with optimal hovering time allocations among them. Based on this solution, we further propose two new trajectory designs for solving the min-energy maximization problem in the general case with the UAV speed constraint considered. Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPT system with optimized UAV trajectory significantly enhances the WPT performance over the conventional WPT system with fixed ETs, and yet achieves fair energy delivery to ERs. It is our hope that this paper will pave a new way for future WPT research. Due to the space limitation, there are various interesting issues unaddressed in this paper, which are briefly discussed in the following to motivate future work.</p><p>• Efficient trajectory design in UAV-enabled WPT systems critically depends on the accurate modeling of the wireless channels from UAV to ERs. In this paper, we assume that the UAV-to-ERs channels are LoS-dominated, and thus use the free-space path loss model, similarly as in prior works <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In certain application scenarios such as in forests, however, there may exist obstacles and rich scatterers between the UAV and ERs, and a more accurate model with path loss exponent larger than 2 should apply. Fortunately, the change in the path loss exponent does not alter the fundamental structures of problems (P1), (P2), and (P3), and therefore, the algorithms and methods proposed in this paper are generally extendable to handle such cases. How to analytically reveal the optimal UAV trajectory under different path loss exponents is an interesting problem worth future research efforts. First, we consider a relaxed problem of (P1) in the ideal case by ignoring the speed constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. By using (5), the relaxed problem can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_77">max {x(t),y(t)} ∫ T 0 ψ(x(t), y(t))dt. (<label>36</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_78">)</formula><p>Due to the relaxation of the constraints (1), the optimal value of problem (36) serves as an upper bound for that of (P1). It is evident that problem (36) can be decomposed into different subproblems as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">max x(t),y(t) ψ(x(t), y(t)), ∀t ∈ T , (<label>37</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_80">)</formula><p>where each subproblem corresponds to a time instant t. By ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">6</ref>) and (37), it is evident that x(t) = x ⋆ and y(t) = y ⋆ is the optimal solution to problem (37) for any t ∈ T . Therefore, {x ⋆ (t), y ⋆ (t)} given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>) is indeed the optimal solution to problem (36).</p><p>Next, it is evident that {x ⋆ (t), y ⋆ (t)} given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>) is always feasible to problem (P1), since the optimal location is fixed and thus no UAV flying is needed. Furthermore, the objective value achieved by {x ⋆ (t), y ⋆ (t)} for problem (P1) is the same as the optimal value for problem (36). Since the optimal value of problem (36) is an upper bound of that of (P1), we can conclude that {x ⋆ (t), y ⋆ (t)} is indeed the optimal solution to (P1). Therefore, Proposition 3.1 is proved.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Proof of Proposition 4.2</head><p>First, it is evident that at the optimal solution {x * (t)} to (P3-2ER), the received energy at the two ERs must be equal. Furthermore, if the UAV stays at a location (x, 0, H) for a certain duration, then it should stay at the symmetric location (-x, 0, H) for the same duration, since otherwise, we can always increase the min-energy of the two ERs by adjusting the two locations to be symmetric.

If D &gt; 2H/ √ 3, then the optimal solution is x * (t) = -ξ, ∀t ∈ [0, T /2). By also choosing x * (t) = ξ, ∀t ∈ [T /2, T ) due to symmetry and using (38), this proposition is proved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Proof of Proposition 5.2</head><p>For K = 2, the optimality of the successive hover-and-fly trajectory can be easily proved in the case of D ≤ 2H/ √ 3. Therefore, in the following, we focus on the proof for the case of D &gt; 2H/ √ 3. First, similarly as Proposition 4.2 for problem (P3-2ER), the optimal trajectory solution to (P2-2ER) should satisfy the symmetric property in (38). In this case, problem (P2-2ER) is re-expressed as follows based on (39). Next, based on Lemma 3.1, ψ(x) is monotonically increasing over x ∈ (-∞, -ξ) and decreasing over (-ξ, 0). As a result, it can be shown that if ξ ≤ V T /2, the UAV should maximize its hovering time at the location (-ξ, 0, H), and fly to the middle point (0, 0, H) with its maximum speed V . In other words, we have x * * (t) = -ξ, ∀t ∈ [0, T /2 -ξ/V ], and x * * (t) = V t -V T /2, ∀t ∈ (T /2 -ξ/V, T /2]. On the other hand, if ξ &gt; V T /2, then the UAV should fly with the maximum speed from the location (-V T /2, 0, H) to the middle point (0, 0, H) to maximize the objective function in (41), i.e., x * * (t) = -V T /2 + V t, ∀t ∈ [0, T /2].</p><p>Combining the above result with the optimal symmetric trajectory in (38), this proposition is thus proved.</p></div>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1" xml:id="foot_0"><p>Notice that this assumption holds approximately if the charging duration and/or the UAV maximum speed are sufficiently large.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="foot_1"><p>Actually, (x ⋆ , y ⋆ ) should lie within the convex hull of all the ERs' locations (x 1 , y 1 ), . . . , (x K , y K ), which is generally a subset of the box [x, x] × [y, y]. Furthermore, denoting the solution accuracy as ε, then the complexity of the 2D exhaustive search method increases inversely with respect to ε 2 and linearly with respect to the number of ERs, K.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4" xml:id="foot_2"><p>When the optimal solution x {λ k } (t)'s, y {λ k } (t)'s, and E ({λ k }) are not unique, they may not be optimal for the primal problem (P3.1) after the dual problem is solved. As a result, an additional step is required to obtain the optimal primal solution of E, x(t)'s, and y(t)'s to (P3.1), as will be shown later in Section IV-A3.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5" xml:id="foot_3"><p>Note that although the TSP is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, various heuristic and approximation algorithms have been proposed to give efficient high-quality solutions for it (see, e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>-<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>). In particular, it has been shown in<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> that the TSP problem can be formulated as a binary integer program, by incorporating a set of constraints to ensure there is only a single tour connecting all visited locations. The binary integer program can be solved via CVX<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> by using the Mosek solver that supports the integer program (see https://mosek.com/ for details).</p></note>
