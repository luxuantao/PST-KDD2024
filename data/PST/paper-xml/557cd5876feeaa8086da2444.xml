<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In Part I of this paper, it was demonstrated that impulsive channel noise can be a serious detriment to the performance of directsequence spread-spectrum multiple-access (DS/SSMA) communications when conventional linear correlation reception is used. In this paper, we consider a hard-limiting correlator as an alternative for reception of multiple-access transmissions in impulsive channels. As with the previous study, we consider K asynchronous binary PSK DS/SSMA users sharing a linear channel corrupted by impulsive noise that is modeled at the output of the front-end filter of the receiver. We develop techniques for analyzing bit error probabilities of this hard-limiting receiver by exact computation for short spreading sequences, by approximation for longer spreading sequences, and by asymptotic limits for infinitely long spreading sequences. Performance is compared to that of the linear correlator under a variety of conditions, and it is seen that hard-limiting correlation reception can offer substantial improvement over conventional systems in impulsive channels. However, the linear receiver is more effective against multiple-access noise only, and so a tradeoff emerges in this problem between rejection of impulsive noise and rejection of multiple-access interference.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION N Part I of this paper</head> <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><p>, the performance of conventional I linear DS/SSMA correlation receivers in the presence of both multiple-access interference and impulsive noise was analyzed. It was seen from this analysis that impulsive noise can seriously degrade the performance of such systems when compared to their performance on Gaussian channels, even when signal-to-noise power ratios are held constant. This indicates that the shape and not merely the variance of the noise distribution is an important factor in performance in this situation. Similar phenomena are well known in single-user communications applications [2], [5]- <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[91, [11]-[141, [20]-[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>, and this problem can be corrected there by utilizing nonlinear correlators that compensate for the non-Gaussian behavior of the channel noise. One such receiver that is both simple to implement and analyze, and effective against impulsive noise is the hard-limiting correlator. In the singleuser case, this receiver outperforms the linear correlator for most impulsive noise models. Given its simplicity, it is thus preferred in the single-user case. However, in the multiuser case, there is the additional factor of performance against the multiple-access interference which must be considered, and one might expect that the use of a nonlinear receiver would result in degradation in this aspect of performance. Thus, the overall effects of impulsive and multiuser interferences on a hard-limiting correlator are not clear.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to study the performance of hard-limiting correlation receivers for direct-sequence spread spectrum in the presence of both impulsive channel noise and multiple-access interference, and to compare this performance to that of linear correlation studied in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. In Section II, we present very briefly the multiple-access model of interest, we introduce the hard-limiting correlation receiver, and we discuss its performance in single-user impulsive channels. An algorithm for the computation of exact error probabilities of this hard-limiting correlator in multiuser impulsive channels is derived in Section 111, and this algorithm is used there to analyze the performance of systems featuring short spreading sequences. The algorithm is applied only t o two-user channels, since computational requirements for cases with more than two users are prohibitive. Section IV is devoted to the development of computationally efficient bounds and approximations to the bit error probabilities of hard-limiting receivers that are suitable for longer spreading sequences. Finally, in Section V, the asymptotic behavior of the hard-limiting correlator, as the length per data bit of the spreading sequences increases without bound, is examined.</p><p>As we shall see, neither of the two receivers analyzed is universally preferred. The hard-limiting correlator is more effective against the impulsive channel noise, while the linear correlator is more effective against the multiple-access noise. Thus, a tradeoff develops, the resolution of which depends on the overall noise characteristics of the channel. However, our analysis shows that, for moderate signal-to-channel-noise ratios, the beneficial effects of hard-limiting outweigh its detrimental effects for those systems considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">PRELIMINARIES</head><p>In this section, we give a very brief description of DSI SSMA signals and state some relevant properties of this multiple-access technique (see <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>). Then, we review the method suggested in [3] for carrying out an impulsive channel assumption in this environment. Also, to gain insight into the multiuser performance of the hard-limiting correlation receiver in non-Gaussian impulsive noise, we consider briefly communications over these channels in the single-user context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General DS/SSMA System Model</head><p>The model of the asynchronous binary PSK direct-sequence SSMA system considered here allows K users to share a channel. The actual signal received at a given receiver in this model for an additive, possibly impulsive channel is given by (see [l] where n ( t ) represents the channel noise, Pk is the power received from the kth user, w, is the carrier frequency common to the K signals, and where &amp; and T k are the phase and delay, respectively, of the kth signal at the receiver. The signal representing the kth user's binary data sequence is bk(t), which is a sequence of unit-amplitude, positive and negative, rectangular pulses of duration T. This data signal is modulated onto a phase-coded carrier. The code waveform ak(t) is generated by the spreading sequence assigned to the kth user. This spectrum-spreading signal can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W ak(t)= ay)PTc(f-jTc), k = l , 2, * * ' , K (2) ,= -w</formula><p>where a?) E { -1 , + 1 } and also a?) = for all j and k and for some integer N . We are also assuming that N is the least period of the sequences. The parameter T, is the chip length, and we assume that T = NT, so that there is one code period ahk), aik), . -*, a s y , per data symbol.</p><p>For each signal in (l), there is an associated delay T k for a given receiver. This time delay accounts for the propagation delay and the lack of time synchronism between transmitters. Without any loss of generality, the correlation receivers studied here are assumed to be matched to the first of the K signals in the DSISSMA system; hence, we need only to consider time delays and phase angles relative to user 1. Therefore, we assume 9, = 0 and T~ = 0 in the analysis of the receiver synchronized to the first user's signal. Furthermore, there is no loss of generality in assuming &amp; E [o, 2x) and 7-k E [0, T ) , 2 4 k 5 K since we are concerned only with time delays modulo T and phase shifts modulo 27r.</p><p>The hard-limiting correlation receiver of interest is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The structure of this nonlinear correlator includes a low-pass filter to transform the received signal to the baseband. This low-pass filter is of the integrate-and-dump type, and its output is sampled every T, seconds. The sampler is followed by a sign detector and in turn by an accumulator. (Note that the hard-limiter could also be placed before the chip-matched filter as in [4]. However, here we are interested in the effects of nonlinear correlation, and thus the structure of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is appropriate.) The test statistic is thus written as</p><p>(3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">j=O j = O</formula><p>where Zj denotes the input to the hard limiter at the j + 1 th sampling instant and where sgn ( -) denotes the usual signum function.</p><p>Assuming equally likely bit polarities, the average bit error probability using the statistic of (3) can be written as + 00 is a sequence of independent data bits for each k and that Pr (bc,k) = -1) = Pr (b$) = + 1) = 1/2 for each k and m.</p><p>The random variables T k and &amp;, 2 5 k 4 K are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the sets of their possible values. We also assume that these variables are independent of the channel noise and of b i ) for all m .</p><p>Impulsive Channel Models Since communication systems are often interfered with by noises other than the classical white Gaussian noise, it is necessary to consider other appropriate (and tractable) noise models. Therefore, in this section, we review a tractable method of studying non-Gaussian channels for correlation receivers which was introduced in Part I of this paper. This method has been used in several previous communication system analyses (see <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> for references).</p><p>In this model, the principal assumption concerning the additive, zero-mean channel noise n ( t ) is that samples 9; taken at the chip rate T,-I after front-end filtering are independent and identically distributed. This assumption is valid when the noise process is white and Gaussian. When the noise process is white but not Gaussian, with the usual lowpass filtering, the samples are uncorrelated, but not necessarily independent at the appropriate sampling rate. However, making the independence assumption is still justified in our model in view of the considerable gain in tractability this assumption yields (see also <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>). This allows us to study non-Gaussian impulsive noise sources by modeling the first-order probability distribution functions of these independent random variables.</p><p>The E mixture (or €-contaminated mixture) is a commonly used and highly tractable empirical model for impulsive distributions (see 1231 and 1261). The €-mixture model has been frequently proposed for describing a noise environment that is nominally Gaussian with an additive impulsive noise component.</p><p>The first-order probability density function (pdf) of this noise model has the form where E E [0, 11 and f n and f, are pdf s <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. The nominal density functionfa(-) is usually taken to be a Gaussian density representing background noise. The impulsive (or contaminating) component of the noise is represented by the density functionfi( .) which is usually chosen to be more heavily tailed thanf,(-). In ( 5 ) , f i ( .) is commonly taken to be Gaussian with large variance, and this is the model we will use here. (Further justification of this model is found in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.) The ratio of the variance of the impulsive component to the variance of the nominal one, defined as y 2 = u;/a:, is usually assumed to be on the order of 10 and 100. The parameter E controls the contribution of the impulsive component to the density function. In this study, we will usually be interested in the effects of variations in the shape of a distribution on the performance of various systems rather than in the effects of simple changes in noise power. Thus, in this model, we will usually vary the parameters E and y2 with the total noise variance u2 = (1 -E)U; + ea; held constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single-User Analysis in Impulsive Noise</head><p>Recall from above that our non-Gaussian noise modeling applies to the samples of noise after front-end filtering. These noise samples can be expressed as (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">n ( t ) cos (wet) dt, j = O , 1, s a . , N-1.</formula><p>As noted above, v i , q ,', . . , qA-l are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables. We take their common mean and variance to be zero and N0Tc/4, respectively. These statistical conditions would result if the input noise were white and Gaussian with spectral height No/ 2. Keeping these conditions constant allows us to compare the results obtained here to those previously found from the study of the performance of linear correlation receivers in the additive white Gaussian noise channel.</p><p>Within these assumptions, we can evaluate the single-user average error probability of the hard-limiting correlation receiver when the noise samples qj ' s are distributed as the e mixture of Gaussians. Due to the symmetry of the system, Pe for the hard-limiting correlator can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">N m = l</formula><p>When K = 1 , it is easy to show that the random variable ( YN + N ) / 2 is binomially distributed under either bit condition.</p><p>From this, if we assume that N is odd, the average bit-error probability for the hard-limiting correlation receiver in the single-user case can be written as</p></div>

In particular, the average error probabilities are shown versus the signal-to-noise ratio converted to dB (Le., SNR = 10 log EL')/No where E t ) 4 P I T is the received energy-per-bit of user 1). Note that the performance varies widely as the shape of the noise pdf changes, with the worst performance among these examples occurring for the Gaussian (E = 0) case. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> compares the single-user performance of the hard-limiting receiver to that of the linear receiver (see [3] for a single-user analysis of the linear correlator in impulsive noise) for the Gaussian (E = 0) and the E = 0.1, y2 = 100 impulsive channel. This figure illustrates that the hardlimiting correlation receiver can offer substantial improvement over the linear correlation receiver for single-user impulsivenoise channels over the interesting range of signal-to-noise ratios.</p><p>We now compare the single-user asymptotic performance of the hard-limiting correlation receiver to that of the linear correlator discussed in [ 3 ] . In particular, we investigate system behavior as the signature-sequence length per data bit becomes infinitely large. We keep the bit interval and the signal and noise energies per bit constant. In the limit, of course, these conditions would usually require infinitely large channel bandwidth, and at the receiving end, samples would be taken infinitely fast. (Also note that in allowing N -+ 00, we must require the carrier frequency wc to increase without bound as well.) Although these conditions are not realistic, they do provide information about the limiting behavior of Pe that could be useful in cases when N is very large, but still finite.</p><p>Within mild regularity conditions, the asymptotic error probability of any symmetric nonlinear correlator under the above conditions is given straightforwardly by (see [SI and The asymptotic single-user performance of the hard-limitwhere u is the efficacy or differential SNR of the system. For ing correlation receiver is compared to that of the linear correlator for several different €-mixture channels in Table <ref type="table">I</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The figure plots asymptotic average error probabilities versus SNR. These asymptotic results reinforce the above-noted potential for improved performance gained by using hard-limiting correlation receivers in place of linear correlators for single-user impulsive noise channels. We will return to these results when considering the asymptotic performance of correlators in multiuser environments in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">EXACT ANALYSIS OF DS/SSMA COMMUNICATIONS IN IMPULSIVE CHANNELS</head><p>We would like to study the multiuser performance of the hard-limiting correlation receiver in impulsive channels under the same conditions as those for which the linear correlation receiver was analyzed in Part I of this study [ 3 ] . Recall that we introduce hard limiting to diminish the influence of large samples (e.g., noise impulses) on the test statistic (see also <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>). In the previous section, we saw that in the single-user environment, hard-limiting correlation receivers can be used to suppress the effects of heavy-tailed impulsive noise, and thus to achieve a lower average probability of error than in a linear correlator operating in the same environment. Here, we analyze the performance of the hard-limiting correlation receiver in the presence of non-Gaussian impulsive noise and multiuser interference, and we compare these combined effects to those on the linear correlation receiver. It should be noted that the hard-limiting receiver of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is extremely easy to implement digitally, and it certainly is no more complex than the linear correlator in this regard.</p><p>The average multiuser bit-error probability for the hardlimiting receiver can be derived from the general form (4). We assume throughout that the number of chips per bit is odd (this is usually the case as N is usually 2" -1 for some integer n).</p><p>Since sgn ( x ) E { -1, + 1 }, the test statistic YN formed by the hard-limiting correlation receiver is an odd integer, i.e., From the symmetry of the system, it follows that the average bit-error probability for the receiver can be written as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">-3 , -1</ref> , + 1 , + 3 , * . . , +N}.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Y N E { -N, -N -2 , . e . ,</formula><p>(10) where b is a vector of data symbols defined as (b (2)1, bf), . e , by,), biK)), 7 is a vector of time delays, and 4 is a vector of phase angles, and where Er,9,b denotes expectation with respect to the subscripted variables.</p><p>It is straightforward to see that in a multiuser environment, the quantity (YN + N ) / 2 has a multinomial distribution which relates to Bernoulli trails with variable probabilities. <ref type="bibr">Thomas and Taub [24]</ref> have obtained an efficient recursive method for computing multinomial probability distribution functions of this type. Here, we apply this technique to evaluate the average error probability in (10). Let p, denote the probability that the j t h input of the accumulator is + 1, i.e., define p, by</p><p>where pI is u_sed to denote the collection of variables e+$, b), and where Z;l) denotes the algebraic sign of a y ) Z j .</p><p>Let q ( j,-n) denote the probability that n of t h e j samples ZO, 21, a * * , Zj-1 are + 1's. Then, we can write the following difference equation:</p><p>where the initial conditions are q ( 1, 0) = 1 -po and q ( 1 , 1) = po. The boundary conditions for j 2 2 are 4 ( j , O ) = q ( j -1, 0)(1 -P;-l) and Next we implement the above recursive technique and compute q ( j , -) f o r j = 0, 1, * . , N -1. The probability of YN = m for odd m's between 1 and N can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Pr [Y,=mlb:)= -1, p I ] = q ( N, N ; m ) - (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where p j defined in (1 1) is used to form the function q.</p><p>can write</p><p>Considering the probabilities pi, J' = 0, 1 , . * , N -1, we p j = P r [ q y ) + I y ) ( b , 7 , 4 ) ~ 117, b, 41</p><p>where qj') is the j t h noise sample normalized to have zero Using the above procedure, the exact value of the average error probabilities of the hard-limiting correlation receiver in multiuser €-mixture channels can be computed via (10). Since we intend to compare the performance of linear correlators <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> to that of hard-limiting correlation receivers, we carry out numerical examples under identical conditions to those considered in [3]. In particular, we consider two users (K = 2) employing max-SNR AO/LSE sequences chosen from [ 16, Table <ref type="table">A</ref>. 1 (a)]. (Computational requirements for K &gt; 2 cases are prohibitive. However, as we will see, the general behavior for larger K can be inferred, at least to some degree, from the K = 2 case.) Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> plots single and two-user average error probabilities of the hard-limiting correlation receiver versus the SNR in this situation for various E-mixture channels under the assumption that the two users have the same power. Note that, unlike the situation for the linear correlator, the effects of adding a second user on the hard-limiting correlator are very nonuniform and are substantial for high signal-to-noise ratios. On the other hand, the improvement exhibited by the hard limiter against impulsive noise only can also be substantial. Thus, it is unclear what the balance of these two effects is. To and two-user performance of the hard limiter to that of the linear receiver for the E = 0.1, y 2 = 100 impulsive channel example. These results indicate that the improvement in performance against impulsive noise obtained by using hardlimiting correlation receivers in place of linear correlators outweighs the detrimental effects of hard limiting in this particular case for those SNR values of particular interest. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> compares two-user performance of the hard-limiting correlator to that of the linear receiver for the Gaussian and E = 0.01, the linear correlation receiver outperforms the hard-limiting correlation receiver for the Gaussian channel in the range of signal-to-noise ratios of interest.</p><p>It is also of interest to consider the near-far effects on the performance of hard-limiting DS/SSMA correlation receivers. In this context, we vary the signal power of the second user with respect to the first user's power level and then compute the error probability. ) we see that, as the other user's relative power increases, there is a point beyond which the linear correlator is superior to the hard-limiting correlator. This again is due to the fact that the linear correlator appears to be more effective than the hard limiter is in dealing with the MA interference. Thus, when the MA interference dominates the impulsive interference, the linear correlator is better. However, this crossover point is higher for more impulsive models, and in most cases occurs beyond the desirable range of error probabilities.</p><p>From the above results, we can conclude that the hardlimiting correlator is a desirable alternative to the linear correlator in a two-user impulsive channel as long as a significant part of the total noise contribution is due to the impulsive noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. APPROXIMATE ANALYSIS OF DS/SSMA COMMUNICATIONS FOR LONG SPREADING SEQUENCES</head><p>One conclusion drawn from our hard-limiting correlation receiver analysis described in the previous section is that computing the exact expression for Pe can be very time consuming for large N. For this reason, when signature sequences of length more than 31 are used, bounds and approximations are needed to replace the exact computation of Pe. In this section, we propose an approximation, an upper bound, and a lower bound for the multiuser error probability of the hard-limiting correlation receiver in impulsive noise. The lower bound uses the idea of truncating a finite sum of positive numbers in the expression for the error probability (10); the approximation is based on estimating the probability distribution function of the test statistic Y N , and the upper bound uses a Chernoff bounding technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Truncated-Series Lower Bound on Pe</head><p>Our first bound on the error probability of the hard-limiting correlation receiver uses the property that Pr [ YN = rn I b t ) = -1 , p,] decreases sharply as m increases to N. The event { YN = rn} has very small probability for large values of rn when conditioned on b t ) = -1 because for YN taking some positive value rn means the output of the hard limiter was + 1 exactly (N + m)/2 times, an event which becomes much less likely as m increases. Therefore, in computing Pe via (IO), we can obtain a reasonably tight lower bound by adding only the first few terms of the sum of odd rn's from 1 to N. The accuracy of this approximation is easily controlled by including more terms in the computation, noting the tradeoff with the cost. As an example, we compute a lower bound by including only (n + 1)/2 terms in the summation in (IO) instead of (N + 1)/2 where n 4 log2 (N + 1). For the €-mixture examples, we examine the tightness of this lower bound of Pe for the hard limiting correlation receiver. Typical results showing the accuracy of this approximation are depicted in Table <ref type="table">I1</ref> in which P f denotes this lower bound. (Also shown are approximate values and upper bounds to be discussed below .) These results are obtained for the same DS/SSMA system considered in the examples in Section 111. Examples are carried out with lengths of signature sequences equal to 3 1 , 63, and 127. As we see from the N = 31 row of the table, this bound appears to be very tight particularly for the more impulsive examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Binomial Approximation</head><p>The above bound is still computationally expensive, although much less so than exact computation. Thus, simpler estimates of Pe are of interest. One such estimate can be based on approximating the distribution function of the test statistic YN, which is given in (3). The error probability for the hardlimiting correlation receiver can be written in a form slightly </p></div>

The results in Table <ref type="table">I1</ref> indicate that (1 9) appears to be a reasonable estimate of Pe, particularly when one considers the relative simplicity of the binomial approximation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cherno ff Bound</head><p>With a view toward upper bounding Pe for the hard-limiting correlation receiver, we examine the tightness of the Chernoff bound when applied to this problem. <ref type="bibr">Saltzberg in [18]</ref> and Lugannani in <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref> used this method for intersymbol interference error bounding, which is similar to the problem of interest here. They found the Chernoff bound to be superior to existing upper bounds in intersymbol interference studies. However, our investigation (not reported in this paper) showed that applying the Chernoff bound to the multiuser communication system in impulsive noise with the linear correlation receiver results in a loose bound for error probability (see also <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>). For the linear case, the momentspace bounds considered in [3] are better.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>In this section, we have introduced three techniques to estimate the average error probability of the hard-limiting correlation receiver in impulsive channels. These methods were used as an alternative to the exact computation used in the previous section when N is large. The truncated-series lower bound estimated P, closely, but was computationally expensive. The binomial approximation and the Chernoff upper bound resulted in rather loose but simple estimates of the error probability of the hard-limiting correlation receiver.</p><p>Collectively, these estimation methods provided good insights into the performance of the hard-limiting correlators when N is large. From Table <ref type="table">I1</ref> by considering the upper and lower bounds on P,, we see that for two-user impulsive channels (e.g., E = 0.1, y 2 = loo), the performance of the hard-limiting correlation receiver improves significantly as we use longer signature sequence lengths. We explore this issue further in the following section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RECEIVERS</head><p>By comparing the results of Section IV to those from [3], we observe more significant improvement in performance of the hard-limiting correlator over the linear correlator as we use longer signature sequence lengths. This is most likely due to the fact that the MA interference becomes a smaller fraction of the total noise picture as N increases. Motivated by this finding, we now investigate the behavior of hard-limiting DS/ SSMA correlation receivers when the length per data bit of the signature sequences used becomes infinitely large. Recall from the single-user analysis of Section I1 that in considering asymptotics, we wish to keep the energy per data bit, the length of the symbol interval T, the noise power, and consequently, the signal-to-noise ratio constant as N changes.</p><p>Note that, conditioned on the multiple-access parameters P I , the hard-limiting test statistic YN of (3) is a sum of N independent random variables.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Motivated by the poor performance of linear correlation for DSISSMA reception in impulsive noise channels [3], in this paper we have studied the performance of the hard-limiting correlation receiver under the same conditions as those for which the linear correlation receiver was analyzed in [3]. We first showed that hard-limiting correlation receivers can offer significant improvement in performance over the linear correlation receiver in single-user impulsive channels. Then the combined effects of impulsive noise and multiuser interference on the performance of hard-limiting correlation receivers was compared to those on the performance of the linear correlation receiver. These results indicate that there is potential for significant improvement in performance by using hardlimiting correlation receivers in place of linear correlators for more impulsive noise channels. Moreover, the improvement becomes more visible as the length of the signature sequences used by the channel subscribers increases. We also noted that, unlike the linear correlation receiver, degradation in performance due to the interfering user is no longer uniform in a range of signal-to-noise values. In fact, as the SNR increases, the hard limiter apparently is not as effective in separating the two users as the linear correlator is. However, this deficiency is outweighed by the improvement against the impulsive noise as long as the channel noise is significant and substantially impulsive.</p><p>To gain further insight into hard-limiting correlation receivers and explore the fundamental limitation of these systems, we have also carried out an asymptotic analysis for these DSI SSMA correlation receivers. In particular, conditions have been obtained under which a multiuser system achieves asymptotic single-user error probabilities in an infinite-user environment by using infinitely long spreading sequences. Since similar conditions assure that the linear correlator also achieves single-user performance asymptotically, this limiting behavior of the probability of error together with the singleuser advantages of hard limiting reinforce the idea that the performance of the multiuser communication system operating in impulsive environments can be improved noticeably by using hard limiting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
