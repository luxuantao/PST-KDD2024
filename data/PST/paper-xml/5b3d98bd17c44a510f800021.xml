<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Vehicular ad-hoc Network (VANET) is an emerging type of Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) with excellent applications in the intelligent traffic system. Applications in VANETs are life critical since human lives are at stake and therefore, interaction among nodes (vehicles) must be established in the most secure manner. To provide security for VANETs, various security measures are designed, the most popular of which is Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). IDS has already proved its worth in detection of malicious nodes in traditional networks but applying the IDS in VANET like networks is somehow different and difficult due to its peculiar characteristics such as resourceconstrained nodes, high mobility of nodes, specific protocols stacks, and standards. This paper presents a brief introduction about the various IDSs, in general, to get the readers well acquainted with the concept of IDS after which an in-depth survey of various IDSs that are propounded for VANETs is put forward followed by analyzing and comparing each technique along with merits and demerits. Some basic instructions have also been presented for developing IDSs that have a potential application in VANET and VANET Cloud. Our aim is to identify leading trends, open challenges, and future research directions in the deployment of IDS in VANET. In order to bridge the research gaps in terms of performance, detection rate and overhead, and also to overcome the challenges of existing IDS in literature, a proactive bait based Honeypot optimized IDS system is also proposed with the aim to detect existing and zero-day attacks with minimal overhead.</p><p>Finally, some open research works being carried out in the field is also proposed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>ANETs is a special type of network designed to enhance the driving experience of users by providing them different services like online video streaming, internet access, selfdriving, etc. In VANETs, nodes which are vehicles are equipped with on-device sensors also called as On-board Unit (OBU) for the sensing of the neighborhood activities, works in distributed and cooperative manner and facilitates exchange of information of crucial importance like vehicle`s speed, location, direction and other road traffic-related information, with other nodes for better road experience. However, VANETs have varying node density and mobility, and with an increase in a number of users, it becomes cumbersome to monitor the activities of the nodes. In dense network scenarios, periodic exchange of cooperative messages with other nodes creates a lot of congestion in the network and also analyzing of these messages becomes next to impossible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Also security is another major issue that emerges from above-mentioned nature of VANET. Since nodes are exchanging sensitive information about itself and it's surrounding with other nodes, the chance of information leakage increases leading to privacy hindering attacks. Malicious nodes also called as intruder is the node which performs malicious activities like information leakage, dropping of packets, modification of information, etc. So to deal with these intruders and malicious users from disrupting the normal network behavior, certain security mechanisms are required so that these malicious users get detected and removed from the network automatically. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> IDS based solutions are being used in the traditional network since ages and have proven their worth of being an effective way of dealing with intrusions in the network. But the use of these traditional IDS based solutions for highly mobile and delay-sensitive networks like VANET possess various challenges due to inherent characteristics of VANET like limited node`s storage, limited computing power, limited power supply, low transmission range, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which need to be addressed. Because of these differences in characteristics and features, the traditional IDS and other security schemes designed for wired/wireless network are not directly applicable to VANETs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. At first, the nodes in which the intrusion detection agents are deployed require high computation and storage capacity for efficient and quick detection of malicious events but in contrast the nodes in VANET like networks are resource constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and thus deployment of IDS in VANET require a highly capable and resource-rich node which is a challenging task. The second characteristics of VANET which possess a challenge in IDS deployment is the high mobility of the nodes. Nodes in VANETs are highly mobile and changes their positions frequently making the observation of malicious user`s behavior bit difficult. The network architecture of VANET is another challenge in the path of IDS deployment in VANET. Since in traditional networks, end systems are directly connected to the specific node responsible for forwarding the packets to the destination. But in VANET, nodes are highly mobile and follows the multi-hop routing in which a node may simultaneously act as forwarding node as well as end system. So for information to reach its destination, the information needs to be sent via multiple intermediate nodes which can be malicious or greedy. Also the nodes are usually distributed and need to cooperate for the information to reach the destination. But this introduces extra delay and congestion into the VANET`s network and also the node may acts greedy and do not forward the information. Last characteristics is the specific network protocols which mean that the VANET don't follow the traditional network protocol and uses protocols like 802.11p, ZigBee, 5G, DSRC, etc. These different protocols introduce new vulnerabilities and new demands for IDS. So considering both the advantages and performance of using IDS in traditional network encouraged us to design an IDS for VANET to enhance its security. But because of above mentioned challenges in deployment of IDS in VANET, various factors need to be considered before its deployment and this motivated us to work on this research area. The first step in the design of an IDS for VANET was to do an extensive literature review of it to understand all the challenges, shortcomings of existing IDS proposals and research gaps which led us to the design of this survey.</p><p>Development and Deployment of IDS for VANETs to deal with malevolent attacks is a challenging task and is different from the traditional networks because of inherent features of VANET. Different variations of IDS based solutions like anomaly, signature based, hybrid, cluster, etc. have been proposed for VANETs since 2010. However, there is a great need for a comprehensive survey that analyzes all the variations of IDS for VANET from different angles. Keeping this in mind, in this paper, a first of its kind comprehensive review has been presented to understand various security threats and attacks in VANET along with the requirement of IDS based solutions in VANET; to propose a taxonomy for the classification of IDS in VANET on the basis of parameters like deployment location, detection methodology and validation strategy used; and finally to understand and identify various challenges in the deployment of IDS in VANET and to find out the various future research directions in this approach. Various approaches presented in the literature for IDS in VANET till date have also been studied and presented on the basis of different comparison parameter with their advantages and limitations enumerated. All the well-known critical threats as well some newer and less-known security threats are also presented to show up the requirement of IDS based solutions in VANET. Based on the review and study of the existing approaches, underdeveloped area and challenges in IDS deployment that still need attention are presented as future scope.</p><p>The rest of this article is divided into nine sections. Section II explains some relevant terms related to VANET, VANET Cloud, honeypot, and IDS. Security attacks that are prevalent in VANETs and VANETs Cloud are discussed in Section III. Relevant and related reviews on IDS for technologies related to VANET such as cloud computing, IOT, MANET, WSN, and 5G is discussed in Section IV. Section V elaborates the review strategy implemented in this article. Detailed classification of IDS for VANET on the basis of three different parameters viz. deployment location, detection technique and validation strategy is presented in Section VI. Section VII gives the output of this survey, and various open issues, challenges and future research possibilities in IDS for VANET and VANET Cloud are discussed. Section VIII gives the elaborated description of the proposed architecture of Bait based Honeypot IDS (HPIDS) for VANET and VANET Cloud to provide detection of known and unknown attacks. Finally, Section IX gives the concluding remark of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELEVANT TERMS</head><p>This section gives a brief overview of core concepts and terms used in this article which will eventually be used for a better understanding of the study conducted using this research article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. VANET and VANET Cloud</head><p>VANET is an emerging branch of MANET consisting of vehicles (also called as nodes) each equipped with an On Board Unit (OBU), Roadside units (RSUs), another important components like certification authorities (CA), Trust authorities (TA), an Access Network, whose main goal is to collaboratively provide road safety and entertainment on the road and also to allow secure dissemination of data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. RSUs are scattered at appropriate intervals to provide uninterrupted assistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. The communication in VANET occurs through various wireless technologies ranging from Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) for medium range communication, ZigBee, Bluetooth, UWB for short-range communication and Cellular technologies, WiMAX, Wi-Fi for long-range communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</p><p>VANET is different from MANET in various ways like nodes movement, speed, dynamic infrastructure, no power and storage like resource constraints, etc. In MANET, nodes can move in any direction and may form mesh topology, but nodes in VANET can move in the predefined and predictable topology, due to fixed roads and lanes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>. Also, the mobility in VANET is very high, and vehicles move at very high speed compared to MANETs, making information dissemination little difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>.</p><p>Various applications are supported by VANETs for providing enhanced driver`s road experience, improved road security, minimal waiting time and higher fuel efficiency. The applications in VANETs can be broadly categorized as a) Road Safety applications, b) Infotainment based Commercial applications, c) Traffic Efficiency and Convenience applications, d) Passengers Health monitoring applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Various variation of communication model exists in VANETs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>. In Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) based communication, vehicles communicate with other vehicles and form a purely ad-hoc network. This type of communication mode is helpful in remote network scenarios where there is not abundant Infrastructure to communicate with. In Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V-2-I) based communications, vehicles communicate with RSU and/or other existing infrastructure for information exchange. Similarly, there exists a mixture of V2V and V2I communication called as hybrid based communication in which both types of abovementioned communication takes place. Nowadays, Cluster based communication is also being used in which clusters of vehicles are formed, and each cluster is equipped with a suitable cluster head (CH) which is made responsible for proper functioning of their respective cluster. In this type of communication, every communication between nodes occurs via their CH only. This communication type, however, suffers from network bottleneck and delay in dense network scenarios as CH gets overburdened during high traffic.</p><p>In VANETs, nodes are sophisticated vehicles equipped with high-end resources like high storage, bandwidth, and computation capabilities. These resources often get underutilized by the vehicle owners as not all of them surf and use all the provided storage, computation, and bandwidth resources all the time during driving. At the same time, there may exist some vehicles with limited resources or vehicles in need of these high-end resources, in addition to their inbuilt resources, for some resource hungry and consuming applications like vehicular user multimedia applications and social networking application. Therefore, different vehicles who want to share their resources on payment basis must cooperate and come together to share their resources, resulting in a completely newer type of ad-hoc vehicular network, called as Vehicular Cloud Network or VANET Cloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. Since all the vehicles on the road don`t have the access to internet all the time, with cloud computing clubbed with VANETs interested vehicles having sufficient internet resources can offer its resource as service on payment basis to other vehicles. Similarly, vehicles with sufficient storage resource can offer the storage to other vehicles as service. So in VANETs, cloud computing can be used for Network as a Service (NaaS), Storage as a Service <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with VANET as Case Study</head><p>Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security mechanism deployed to provide protection and safeguard to various critical and security-sensitive networks like WSN, MANET, 4G, IOT etc. from malicious users performing malevolent attacks.</p><p>A typical IDS consists of core module like information collector usually sensors deployed at various sensitive locations, an analysis engine for analysis of the information collected via sensors and a reporting module which logs and raises alarms in case of detection of any malicious and abnormal event.</p><p>Sensors which are used for information collection are mostly deployed in locations which are prone to attacks and have a high probability of getting compromised and whose compromisation can lead to leakage of juicy and sensitive information. In VANET like networks, the location of IDS sensors are usually vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs). The task of these sensors is to sense and collect the flowing network information and send it to the analyzing and detection engine which then analyzes the captured information using different ways depending upon the type of IDS being deployed. On identification of any abnormality or any malicious event, the detection engine sends the report to the reporting engine which casts the event to the appropriate users for making them aware and to take suitable actions against the malicious event and malicious user.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Zero Day Attacks in VANET and their Threat Implications</head><p>Zero-day attacks poses a relentless challenge in Cyber Security in terms of their detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. A Zero-day attacks are the ones that are unknown to the public community and their detection pattern are unknown to the detection framework and thus are difficult to detection and prevent. Work on the detection of such unknown attacks are there in literature and majority of them makes use of anomaly detection approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50]</ref>. Although, anomaly based approaches are capable in detection of zero-day attacks to some extent but the anomaly based approaches suffers from a major challenge of generation of huge number of false positives in detection. Apart from the use of anomaly based approaches for the detection of zero-day attacks, there are some work by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref> in which a similar zero-day variation of Sybil attack is addressed. In this work, it has been analyzed that in privacy-preserving network environment of VANETs, it becomes hard to detect a zeroday Sybil vehicle, i.e. vehicle cannot locally detect a Sybil attacker before the attacker is formally revoked. So the authors have proposed a Local Sybil Resistance scheme (LSR) for locally detection of Sybil attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a)</head><p>Challenges in Zero-Day Attacks Detection</p><p>• Constant Threats: New code and software are developed every day, and thus the chance of new flaws also get increased.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SECURITY THREATS AND ATTACKS IN VANETS</head><p>Although there is a lot of advancement in the technology of VANETs but it is still susceptible to various existing and new security attacks and thus need to be addressed. Attacks in VANETs can be categorized on the basis of various parameters like "Insider Versus Outsider Attacks", "Active Versus Passive attacks", "Attack on Security parameters i.e. Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality and Authenticity" as shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Denial of Service (DOS) attack in VANETs</head><p>This is the attack on availability and works by making the resource unavailable for the authorized and intended users <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. In VANETs, network resources should be working and available all the time as VANET are associated with life-critical applications and network should be available especially in the cases when other nodes are sending any life critical data to the other set of nodes. This attack works by jamming the communication channel and preventing the legitimate vehicles from accessing the network and its resources and thus disrupts the working of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.There are various ways of performing DOS attack in VANETs and VANET Cloud. a) Attacking the Communication Channel: In this type of DOS attack, the attacker sends the jamming signal to the communication channel in a particular range of area and thus prevents all the vehicles in that range from communicating with each other. This attack will last till the attacker is sending the high frequency jamming signal in that area. b) Attacking and overwhelming the Node: In this attack, the attacker sends a huge amount of garbage traffic to a particular node or a RSU and thus keeping it indulged in processing that traffic and preventing it from performing any other task. c) DOS attack by dropping the traffic: In this attacker drops all the traffic forwarded to it and thus makes the traffic information unavailable for the other nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack in VANETs</head><p>This is the enhanced type of denial of service attack and is more severe and powerful compared to the traditional DOS attack. In this variation of DOS attack, instead of single attacker multiple nodes act as an attacker to overwhelm the node. This attack is more difficult to mitigate, and the mitigation techniques used for traditional DOS don't work for the DDOS attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Hidden Vehicle Attack in VANETs</head><p>In this attack, attacker vehicle prevents the accidental vehicle from broadcasting the accident warning to other vehicles by convincing the accidental vehicle that it is in a better position to inform all other vehicles about the accident but in actual it will not broadcast the information and will silence the accidental node from broadcasting the warning message.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Tunnel Attack in VANETs</head><p>Since the GPS signal gets lost in tunnels, so the attacker can exploit this flaw by inserting bogus information into the vehicle`s database after it leaves the tunnel and before it gets original location update. An attacker can also create a Tunnel like situation by creating GPS Jamming signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Tampering with Sensor Information</head><p>In this attack, the attacker can tamper the sensor information like current location, speed, etc. to escape liability in case of the accident.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. ID Disclosure</head><p>This attack involves disclosing and stealing the identities of the other nodes and using these identities for further attacks like geolocating the nodes using the ID, thus hindering the privacy aspect of the security. Taxi and Cab owners are using this attack for tracking their cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Wormhole attack in VANETs</head><p>Wormhole attack is a severe and popular attack in VANETs and other ad-hoc networks. This attack involves two or more than two malicious nodes and the data packet from one end of the malicious node is tunneled to the other spiteful/malicious node at the other point, and these data packets are broadcasted. In the wireless network, this malicious node even listens to the packets not intended for them and then tunnels them to the other end of the tunnel. A wormhole attack is capable of conducting a DOS attack, disrupting the routing of the network. Wormhole attack can easily disrupt the multicasting and broadcasting routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Blackhole attack in VANETs</head><p>In this attack, a node opts out from participating in the network and sharing information or when an established node opts out and thus forms a black hole. So all the traffic intended for that particular node will be lost causing problem in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. In this attack, the malicious node called as Black hole node attracts the other nodes by making them appear to have the greatest path to their destination and thus instead of forwarding the packets to the destination drops the data causing the Denial of Service attack in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>. Blackhole attack is categorized in two ways: Single Blackhole attack and Combined Blackhole Attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Bush Telegraph attack in VANETs.</head><p>Bush telegraph is the enhanced version of bogus information attack. In this attack, the attacker gains access to large no of entities spread over a various wireless hop. This attack follows the basic working functionality feature of VANET that after receiving a packet, every hop checks the packet for error count. If the error count is less or tolerable, the packet is accepted and processed. This attack exploits this logical bug and adds a small error at every packet at each hop. So after passing by some hops, this accumulated error leads to the bogus information and leads to packet drop <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J. Location Spoofing / Global Positioning System Spoofing</head><p>With this attack, an attacker can spoof/hide his/her position and can make other nodes believe that the vehicle is in some other position. In this way, an attacker can protect himself from legal actions in case of an accident or traffic signal violation by the attacker. In VANET, there is a GPS system that contains the location table of all the vehicles containing the current position and identification of all the vehicles. An attacker can create an illusion that they are present at some distinct location by altering the location table of the GPS System by generating and sending stronger fake location signals to the GPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>K. Spoofing attack in VANET</head><p>In this, the malicious node pretends to be some legitimate node for the purpose of stealing sensitive and confidential information and for getting super privilege for which he/she is not intended. One kind of this attack is Man in the Middle Attack in which malicious node can sit between the two communicating nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L. Privilege Escalation attack in VANET.</head><p>In this type of attack, an attacker exploits some bug, design issue or some misconfiguration errors to escalate its privileges to sensitive data that are protected from normal users <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M. Alternation attack</head><p>In this attack, attacker alters the transmitted data during its transmission. It includes delaying the transmitted data, replaying the earlier transmitted data, or modifying the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>N. Sybil attack in VANET</head><p>In Sybil attack, attacker node steals and forges the identity of existing nodes and then these stolen identities can be used to simulate further attacks like creating the illusion that the node is present in different locations and thus can lead to stealing of the information not intended for the malicious node <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>.</p><p>Sybil attack also called as identity spoofing attack works when attacker simulates identities of various nodes and send messages from different identities to other nodes at the same time. Attacker node spoofing other node`s identities is called Sybil attacker or malicious node, and node whose identity is spoofed is called as Sybil node as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This attack can create the illusion among others that there are multiple vehicles on the road. Example of this attack is when an attacker creates an illusion that there are multiple vehicles on some road and other innocent VANET nodes broadcast the wrong message that there is a traffic jam on the road <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60]</ref>. Using this multiple fake identity attack, an attacker can easily inject false information into the network and can create a ruckus in the network. In the first type, communication originates from the Sybil node to some legitimate node. In the second type of communication, some legitimate node sends some data packets to the Sybil node which will be eventually listened by a malicious node that has created this Sybil node. Also, the communication between the Sybil node and the legitimate node can be direct or indirect. Direct communication exists when the Sybil nodes contact the legitimate node. Indirect communication occurs when the legitimate node contacts with the Sybil node via malicious node. c) Participation Type: An attacker can create multiple identities of a single node and then can use these spoofed identities all at once or one by one depending on his/her need. A total number of identities an attacker uses is always equal to or less than the total number of actual nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>O. Timing attack in VANET</head><p>Since VANET works on real-time traffic and thus all the messages should reach to its intended users well on time without any delay. In timing attack, a malicious node (attacker) without altering the message add some time delay to the message so that message reaches its intended user after the required time <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref> as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref> have discussed the criticality of delay in VANET and have explained different type of timing attacks in VANET.</p><p>Various  attack, an attacker can add delay to the authentication request packet sent by the node for authenticating itself. This will make the RSU receive the authentication packet after the extra added time slot and the time by which the RSU responds to the vehicle with the authentication packet, the vehicle might have entered the vicinity of another RSU as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Another scenario where this attack can be critical is when a node wants to inform the RSU about the accident that has taken place but attacker using the timing attack adds extra delay to the message causing this critical safety message to reach the RSU not on time and eventually leading to road congestion. So timing attack can prove to be critical in various situations and can cause severe safety issues if not addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P. Social attack in VANET</head><p>In this attack, the attacker sends some unethical messages to the driver for the purpose of annoying and provoking the driver. In return, the legitimate driver behaves in a displeased manner which is main intention of the attacker. This affects the operating of the user and thus affects the whole network <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q. Message suppression attack in VANET</head><p>In this, attacker selectively drops some packet which may contain sensitive information. For example, an attacker can drop accident alert message to prevent the other vehicles from taking the alternative path <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R. Malware attack in VANET</head><p>Malware attacks include the attacks by viruses, worms, etc. which disrupts the functioning of the network. VANET is also prone to malware attack because of the existence of software components in hardware units like OBU and RSU. A malicious insider node is most probable of carrying out malware attacks instead of the outsider. This malware attack can be carried out in VANET in the form of software updates <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S. Greedy Driver attack in VANET</head><p>The drivers for their own benefit can inject false warning messages in the network causing the disruption in the normal functioning of the network. For example, for the purpose of getting clear and rush free road, a greedy driver can broadcast false traffic jam information to other vehicles causing them to change their route. If these type of greedy driver increases then the legitimate users will face slow and disrupted network services <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T. Rogue RSU Clone attack</head><p>In this attack, the attacker creates a rouge and fake clone of some specific or random legitimate RSU and place them on the road as normal RSU. So all the innocent vehicular node communicating with this rogue RSU node gets compromised and leads to further attacks like data theft, identity theft, confidentiality and integrity violations, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RELEVANT REVIEWS</head><p>Over the recent years, numerous review articles have been published on the use of IDS for VANET like networks such as MANET, WSN, IOT, cloud computing and 5G.</p><p>A study of various recently IDS in WSNs, and a different classification of IDS approaches based on the detection techniques employed have been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>. Anomaly based detection, misuse based detection and specification based detection are the three main classes of IDS explored by authors in this study. A brief overview of existing security attacks in WSN along with the corresponding proposed IDSs solution to tackle those attack is also provided in this study. Various challenges the IDS is currently facing along with the future research track for IDS in WSN is also highlighted by the authors. From this survey, authors have concluded that although tremendous work on IDS in WSN has been done in last few years but few topics and research areas like the balance between resource consumption and accuracy, IDS architectures, integration of various underlying mechanisms, etc. still need development.</p><p>In order to strengthen the existing state of art security of WSN and to allow researchers working in this field an exhaustive survey on various proposed IDS in WSN for protection against malevolent attacks has been performed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In this study, authors have presented different classification techniques, design specifications and requirements of the IDS. Also, the IDS designed for MANET and their applicability with WSN is discussed. A detailed information of each IDS scheme designed for WSN along with its advantage and disadvantage has been provided. Nodal Energy is the very crucial parameter that needs to be considered in WSNs as WSN nodes have energy constraint and this energy gets usually wasted while performing tasks like sensing of the surrounding, analyzing and processing of collected sensed information and during the dissemination of data. So a lightweight and less energy-hungry IDS need to be deployed in WSN in order to spare energy of the nodes for performing other crucial operations of the WSNs. So considering the energy as an important constraint and as per the survey conducted by the authors, the authors have recommended the use of WSN hierarchical based IDS in which the whole network is divided into clusters and each cluster having its own CH. IDS will run on CH nodes only saving the energy of rest of the nodes and eventually increasing the total lifetime of the WSN. For mobile WSN nodes, distributed and cooperative IDS are most optimal and robust to use. For stationary WSN nodes, centralized IDS scheme is best to use. Issues and challenges in IDS deployment in WSN are also discussed by the author in this article.</p><p>An exhaustive survey of various IDS schemes applicable to the Internet of Things (IOT) has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>. IDS in IOT was classified on the basis of parameters like detection method, placement strategy, security threat and validation strategy. 18 papers on IDS in IOT was studied thoroughly, and it has been found that IDS schemes for IOT is still incipient and still need improvement as the proposed IDS solutions do not cover a wide range of attacks and IOT technologies. Also, it is still not clear about which detection method and placement strategy would be optimal for IOT systems. Also, the validation strategies used are not well consolidated. Issues like increasing the attack detection range, investigation of limitation and advantages of different method and deployment strategy, improvement of validation strategies and enhancement of security of traffic alert and management are few topics that can be focused on by the future researchers.</p><p>Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> come up with a detailed and exhaustive study on different IDS proposed for MANETs which is a highly prone network to various security attacks due to its inherent characteristics. Authors have categorized the IDS techniques for MANETs based on the primary detection engine used by the detection technique. IDS for MANETs has been categorized by authors as Statistical based, Misuse or Signature based, Anomaly based, Specification based and Hybrid based. Feature of detection technique of each category including their strengths and limitations are highlighted to provide a comparative analysis among them. The authors have also enumerated various future research areas and challenges in the area of IDS for MANETs that still need attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. REVIEW TECHNIQUE &amp; STRATEGY</head><p>This section elaborates the motivating factors for conducting this research on IDS in VANET and VANET Cloud and also the review strategy used in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Review Plan</head><p>Stages involved in this literature review on IDS for VANET and VANET Cloud includes building a review framework, downloading research papers from the online libraries, analyzing the survey, interpreting the results of the review,  VANET is a future of existing transportation system. Security is one crucial aspect in VANET which need continuous attention to prevent malicious and evil-intentioned users from disrupting the normal working of the network and to prevent the disastrous outcomes from it. So there is a dire need of studying and exploring the distinct attacks and various available security solutions in literature. IDS`s are already proven to provide overall security in various other network so it is a good step to explore the outcomes of deploying of IDS in VANET like network. However, VANET is somehow different from other networks in terms of mobility, randomness, resource constraints, communication, information exchange, etc. so main objective of this survey is to find out the best existing IDS type in different VANET network scenarios.</p><p>1. Is it possible to employ some proactive security solutions along with IDS in VANET? 2. What are the various proactive security techniques? 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Research Questionnaire</head><p>The very first step in conducting the review involves framing of research questionnaire and searching for relevant papers in different online databases and identification of various existing techniques. Table <ref type="table">II</ref> gives the set of research questions required to plan along with the corresponding motivation and conduct the survey on IDS in VANET.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Source of Information</head><p>Various online databases were searched and consulted for finding relevant resources for conducting this survey. These include Springer (www.springer.com), Google Scholar (scholar.google.com),Science Direct(www.sciencedirect.com), IEEE Explore (www.ieeeexplore.ieee.org), ACM Digital library(www.acm.org),WileyInterscience(www.interscience.w iley.com),Taylor and Francis Online (www.tandfonline.com) etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Search Keywords</head><p>This exhaustive search on IDS in VANET include both qualitative and quantitative research papers from the year 2004 to 2017. The research on topic IDS was started very long back but the use of IDS scheme in VANET was brought into practice from the year 2010, and the rigorous research on IDS in VANET started after 2014 as shown via Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Research papers from journals, conferences, symposium, college thesis, workshops, etc. were included in this review. Initially, a total of 52 papers on IDS were retrieved using the keywords mentioned in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>, which after applying certain inclusion and exclusion criteria as filters on the basis of titles, abstracts, full texts, etc. gets reduced to 25 papers.</p><p>Various search strings like "Intrusion detection in VANET/VANET Cloud" has been used for searching of papers. A complete list of search strings used is mentioned in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. Exclusion criteria used at different stages are described in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. We also applied individual searches on some journals of Springer, Wiley, Taylor and Francis, Science Direct, and so forth to cross-check the e-search.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Data Extraction</head><p>Extracting relevant data from the available research articles is a very crucial and sensitive task. Various authors whenever required were contacted for finding the in-depth knowledge of the research. To avoid biasing at research worker`s end, the review process involving extraction of relevant information from all the 25 considered research papers was done by one author and finalized by another author by discussions, reviews and iteration methods.</p><p>The following procedure for data extraction was used in our review:</p><p>• The relevant outcome from each of 25 research papers on IDS in VANET was extracted after an in-depth review. • Review outcomes were verified and cross-checked by other authors, and if there were any conflict, then a meeting was called to resolve the issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Study and analysis of References in the Article</head><p>A study of articles in term of a number of citation of an article has also been done in this review. The number of times a research article has been cited and referenced is taken as a factor to decide whether to reject or to accept and study the article. Also, other factor like whether the article is published in a journal, conference, a book chapter, a thesis is used for inclusion and exclusion of an article.</p><p>Based on the study, it has been found that out of 25 considered article, only 1 papers have 0 citations, while for 2 articles, the citation metric is not available. Also, no work is found related to the use of IDS in VANET Cloud. It is also evident from the graph in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Distributed and Individual Node IDS (Decentralized IDS)</head><p>Distributed and decentralized based IDS involves deployment of IDS on all or some of the nodes as shown via Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Since nodes in VANET are vehicles and are mostly resource-constrained. So deployment of heavy and complex IDS can lead to resource exhaustion of that node and thus there is a need of lightweight but efficient IDS capable of detecting malevolent attacks with minimal resource consumption. For dealing with the above issues, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> has presented a distributed lightweight IDSs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is capable of dealing with both internal as well as external attack using the set of rules instead of using complex computation based IDS and to reduce the false positive and improve the detection accuracy, Vehicular Behavior Estimation (VBE) is also proposed in which each monitored vehicles are assigned certain malicious level according to the type of attacks they generate. IDS in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, in turn, via information exchange among multiple layers i.e. between the physical layer and network layer, MAC layer and Network layer, and between physical, MAC and Routing layers detect and isolates the threat. At the physical layer, each node is assigned with a signature key and every message is multiplied by it. Maximum likelihood approach is used to test the message for legitimateness. At MAC layer, monitored nodes are checked for RTS and CTS message while at the network layer, the watchdog is deployed to overhear the exchanged packets. Information exchange between different layers improves the detection rate of the IDS. A similar distributed cross-layer based IDS has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> in which authors have suggested the deployment of different IDS modules collecting audit data from different layers in all the nodes.</p><p>Addressing the resource limitations of the vehicles, another lightweight and in-vehicle IDS has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for CAN network. Both signature and anomaly feature has been incorporated into the vehicles for the detection of intrusion. The proposed IDS uses the time analysis of received CAN message for the detection of any intrusion and claims to work with zero false positives. However, this distributed IDS is designed to detect only injecting based attacks.</p><p>Another distributed and individual node deployed IDS has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in which each vehicle are equipped with a lightweight IDS independent of any infrastructure and expensive hardware like RSUs. This IDS make use of the statistical method for detection of malicious nodes. This approach requires cooperation among other nodes for the exchange of traffic information.</p><p>Similar distributed based IDS has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> which uses both signature as well as anomaly detection for countering DDOS attack on VANETs. The IDS component is deployed on each node to detect any malicious behavior as well as the malicious nodes in the network. The installed IDS component monitors the behavior of every other node to check if it is trying to prevent access to any resource of the network. Although monitoring of every other node can lead to extra-burden on the resource constraint node, but simulation result claims to provide high detection and low false positive rate. The Same author has come up with a similar variation of distributed IDS in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> where ANN based IDS is used and deployed on the vehicles for the detection of DOS attack.</p><p>A Similar distributed deployed IDS using deep neural network has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for CAN bus network in which the IDS is deployed in some specialized node but because of the broadcasting nature of the considered CAN bus network, IDS can be integrated into all the nodes also in distributed fashion. The proposed IDS claims to provide realtime detection along with enhancement in the detection rate in CAN bus.</p><p>Another distributed and every vehicle deployed IDS using artificial neural network along with Proportional Overlapping Scores (POS) for optimal feature selection from the traffic traces has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Instead of deploying the IDS on the RSU or on any specialized nodes, the proposed IDS is deployed on every vehicle to provide continuous protection against potential threats even when the no RSU is in the surroundings.</p><p>Distributed IDS sometimes works independently on their own using their own set of attack rules while some variation requires cooperation from other nodes and monitoring of other nodes for its efficient working and detection accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>. A node that monitors its neighboring nodes is called as watchdog node. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref> are some distributed watchdog based solutions in which watchdog are deployed in every node, and these nodes monitor the activity of their neighbor nodes or in case of them acting as intermediate nodes. A variation of distributed watchdog based IDS can be seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>, where instead of all nodes only some of the nodes are made as watchdogs.</p><p>Advantage: No single point of failure, Low network congestion and simple in design and deployment. Disadvantage: These IDS type introduce an extra burden on both nodes as well as network. Special optimization and lightweight IDS need to be used in this deployment strategy as the nodes in VANETs are resource constrained. Also, cooperative version of this IDS introduces extra overhead into the network as information needs to be exchanged between the nodes for IDS working. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Centralized RSU based IDS</head><p>In this variation, IDS are deployed in a centralized component called as RSU. This type of IDS has a benefit over the distributed individual node based IDS as unlike former nodes, RSU is not resource constrained and thus high power IDS with high accuracy, and more capability can be used in the VANET. Advantage: Deployment location of IDS in this type of IDS are not resource constrained. Disadvantage: RSUs are not uniformly deployed in the VANETs. Rural area has less RSU density compared to urban areas and thus can affect the performance of the IDS. Also in RSU based IDS, all the information need to pass through the RSU for analyzing the traffic and for the detection of malicious nodes, in dense network scenarios this can lead to RSU overwhelming and leading to performance degradation. Also, the centralized IDS may have difficulty in monitoring the nodes during an attack that compromises part of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Centralized Cluster Head Deployed IDS</head><p>In this IDS type, Cluster head nodes of every cluster in the network are made as IDS as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. This deployment strategy has an advantage over decentralized and centralized RSU based IDS in terms of low network congestion and continuous protection against intruders even in no RSU and remote areas. Also, nodes in VANET are highly mobile and frequently changes their locations making it difficult to monitor, store and analyze their behavior. So all aforesaid issues with real-time IDS deployment and monitoring get overcome by the CH deployed IDS technique.</p><p>A Centralized CH deployed IDS scheme has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> where the CHs first operate as watchdogs to monitor and collect data related to the behavior of the MPR nodes which is then further used by the SVM based IDS to check the node for maliciousness. On detection of a node as malicious, the information of it is circulated to the CHs of other clusters. This CH based deployment strategy solves the problem of detection issues due to high mobility of the nodes.</p><p>Advantage: Less network congestion, as CH already has all the information of the whole cluster and thus making it as IDS reduces the disadvantage of Distributed individual node IDS. Disadvantage: In dense network scenarios, this IDS deployment strategy suffers from high detection time and low detection rate. Also, the extra responsibility of IDS on the resource constrained CH node can affect the performance of the CH and eventually hampers the whole network performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Hybrid IDS placement</head><p>Hybrid location positioned IDS is formed by clubbing the features of both Centralized and Distributed IDS to take advantage of their good points and avoids the limitations. Hybrid location positioned IDS are both distributed as well as centralized. IDS are deployed in both, all and some individual nodes as well as on the Centralized components like RSU, Cluster head, etc. also as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>.</p><p>A hybrid location deployed IDS has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> in which the three layers of IDS is used based upon their deployment location: Local Intrusion Detection System (LIDS) in which the IDS is deployed on each vehicle in the cluster, Global Intrusion Detection System (GIDS) in which the IDS deployment is done on the Cluster Head (CH) of every cluster and finally a Global Decision System (GDS) in which IDS is deployed on the RSUs. For efficient and accurate detection of intruders from the network, signature based IDS and hybrid Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. Hybrid Deployed IDS based IDS (signature + anomaly) are used by LIDS and GIDS respectively. LIDS monitors its neighbor nodes for maliciousness and information about the suspected malicious node is passed to the GIDS which further verifies that suspected node for maliciousness and final decision to isolate the node is taken by the GDS only. Advantage: Hybrid version of this IDS enhances the detection rate as well as the detection accuracy as the intrusion is crosschecked by different layers of IDS deployments. Disadvantage: Adds extra delay in malicious node detection by adding multiple intrusion validations which can lead to disastrous results in delay sensitive VANETs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Detection Techniques</head><p>IDS for VANET and VANET Cloud are classified into six categories based on the type of detection technique used in the system for the detection of threats: Signature based, Watchdog based, Anomaly based, Hybrid, Cross-Layer based and Honeypot based proactive IDS. The comparison of these techniques is explained in tabular form in Table <ref type="table">V</ref>.</p><p>The main aim of this section is to understand how these techniques have been used to develop IDSs for VANET and VANET Cloud.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Signature based IDS Approaches</head><p>Signature based Intrusion detection approaches also known by names like misused based approaches and rule based detection system detects the malicious nodes and attacks generated by such nodes by matching their signature against the predefined database of signatures and in case of a match, an alarm is generated by the IDS. However, Signature based approaches are capable of detecting only those attacks whose signature is defined in the signature database. Any modification in attack pattern makes the IDS incapable of detecting the attack. Also, Signature based IDS are not capable of detecting zero-day attacks, and the rule database needs to be regularly updated to deal with the newer emerging attacks.</p><p>Deployment of Signature based IDS in VANET is a complex task as it is difficult to have predefined rules for the possible VANET attacks. Also, the Network administrator requires modeling the malicious attack pattern for the detection of Future attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>.</p><p>Due to aforesaid problems, not many signature based approaches have been adopted so far for the detection of intrusions in VANET. However, most of the signature based IDS in literature follows the watchdog approach in which certain specific nodes are assigned the task of monitoring the packets flowing in the network.</p><p>Efficient and Lightweight IDS for VANET (ELIDV) is a rule based IDS proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> which use set of attack signatures for the detection of 3 type of attacks: Sybil attack, Blackhole attack and False Information alert attack. ELIDV is capable of addressing both internal and external attacks and is deployed on each vehicle. Vehicle Behavior Evaluation (VBE) is used along with the Signature based IDS • High False Positive Rate • High overhead and computational cost.</p><p>• Difficult to identify the type of attack taking place.</p><p>• High detection time and delay • Requires huge training and optimal features for higher accuracy.</p><p>• Weak profile accuracy due to frequent change in observed events.</p><p>• Unavailable during behavior profiles updation and rebuilding • Consumes more energy • Generates extra overhead over the network by monitoring, analyzing and sharing information across multiple layers. • Efficiency and performance degrades with increase in high mobility nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hybrid based IDS</head><p>• Capable to detect known as well as unknown attacks with low false positives and detection errors.</p><p>• High Computational Cost In order to mitigate the various integrity violation and authenticity based attacks, another rule based IDS solution called REST-Net has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. REST-Net`s detection engine monitors and analyzes the data using extended plausibility check for the identification of fake message attacks. The plausibility check in REST-Net performs both Pre-validation as well as Post-validation by validating both the Beacons broadcast before and after a particular warning messages. Set of dynamic and static rules adaptive to the realtime traffic conditions are used by the IDS for the detection of malicious events. For enhancing the driving experience of the drivers because of frequent interruptions due to malicious event detection, adaptive warning levels are used, and on the detection of any fake message, the fake message revocation is done. For evaluating the performance of REST-Net, simulations are performed using VANET-Simulator on microtraffic simulator and maps of Berlin, New York, and Puebla. Advantage: Plausibility check using dynamic rules perform both pre and post validation of beacon message and thus improves the detection rate. Also, adaptive warning levels are used for better driver experience even in fake message attack scenarios. Fake messages detected by the detection engine are removed from the network. Disadvantage: The proposed IDS addresses only one attack i.e. fake message injection attack. Also, it is not capable of detecting new attacks automatically. Future Scope: Ways of sharing the REST-Net data and alerts between vehicles can be studied which will help in improving the detection rate of IDS but will also lead to new attacks detection. Also, for improving the REST-Net detection rate, REST-NET IDS can be combined with other existing OSI layer IDS modules.</p><p>A signature based IDS is proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> that uses plausibility model for vehicle movement data. The proposed IDS is capable of identifying a single fake vehicle using the plausibility model even if it uses a valid movement. The IDS is used for detection of two type of attackers: a) roadside attackers performing faked traffic congestion attack and b) attackers in the attempt of denying the real congestion by insertion of moving vehicles into the network. Plausibility clause model has been used in the proposed solution as a rule for the signature based IDS to make sure that no two vehicles intersect each other or on top of each other. Also, a trust model to identify the source of the attack along with the attack is proposed. Disadvantage: Designed to detect only two attacks: a) fake congestion and b) denying existence of congestion. Also, the attack rule for the above two attacks are static, so a small change in the pattern of attack can make them undetectable. Future: In its present state, the proposed IDS is only capable of identifying the fake congestion attack. It is not able to identify the attackers performing that attacks. So in future versions, solutions to identify the source of the attacks will be done.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Watchdog based IDS in VANETs</head><p>In this special variation of IDS, some nodes are assigned the task of monitoring other nodes in its vicinity for the purpose of detection of any malicious activities performed by them. The node made as watchdog works in promiscuous mode and overhear all the traffic flowing through the network.</p><p>If any node, say A, has to send a packet to destination node, say D, and say path between node A and node D has intermediate nodes B and C. Then the source node A will first send the packet to node B which then forwards the same packet to node C while keeping a copy of the packet with it. Now, node B will monitor the node C`s activity whether it forwards the packet to destination node D or not. If node C drops the packet destined for node D, then node C is declared as malicious. Similarly, node B also checks the node C whether it retransmits the packet passed to it or not. If the packet is retransmitted by node C, then also node C is marked as malicious.</p><p>However, Watchdog technique is believed to incur more energy and resources as the watchdog nodes are required to overhear all the packets in the promiscuous mode. So to reduce the challenge of excessive resource consumption by watchdog nodes need to be handled during the design and deployment of watchdog mechanism. Also, the watchdog is believed to deal with greedy driver and selfish node attacks only.</p><p>Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> have proposed an IDS based on watchdog for the detection of the selfish nodes performing malicious Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>. Bayesian Filter based Watchdog for detection of Selfish nodes activities for their own benefits. In this approach, every node is equipped with watchdog component for the monitoring and verification of the neighboring nodes to check whether they forward the packet to the next node or not. Because of high mobility in VANET, there are chances of nodes to drop the packet. That node can also be marked as malicious by the watchdog. So for improving the detection accuracy of the proposed IDS, Bayesian filter technique is used along with the watchdog. So after the detection of any node as malicious by the watchdog, Bayesian watchdog keeps a check on the detected node for certain time interval. If the maliciousness of the node under consideration exceeds a certain defined threshold, then that node is declared as malicious. Advantage: Simulation results claims that this version of watchdog based IDS has high detection accuracy and low false positive rate. Disadvantage: This is capable of detecting selfish nodes only which are performing malicious network activities like packet dropping for their own benefits. Also, this technique has no control over the detected selfish and malicious nodes as explained in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>. Proposed Watchdog based IDS only detects the malicious node and do not isolate the malicious node from taking part in future communication. Also, no information is provided regarding the simulation parameters and node density. Future: This approach can be extended by using various other security approaches along with it to deal with other attacks also.</p><p>Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> have come with a cooperative watchdog based IDS proposal for dealing with selfish and misbehaving nodes in Vehicular Delay Tolerant Networks (VDTNs). In this approach, a greedy node is differentiated from the normal node in such a way that a node with reputation value less than 20 and that drops the packets immediately upon receiving them at least once. The whole proposed system works by cooperative exchange of other node`s reputation values and also by use of classification, neighbor`s evaluation and a decision module for the detection and isolation of selfish node from the network. For the evaluation of the proposed watchdog based IDS, VDTNSim Simulator is used and Spray and Wait routing protocol is used for the routing of the packets. Advantage: Detects as well as isolate the detected selfish node. Simulation results show that the proposed system not only detects the selfish nodes efficiently but also improves the network performance by raising the packet delivery ratio and reducing the resource wastage by decreasing the packet drops. Disadvantage: Works against the selfish nodes only. It is not mentioned about its capability to detect the malicious nodes performing a plethora of VANET attacks. Future Work: Extending the existing Cooperative Watchdog System by enabling the cooperative exchange of information like packet forwarding errors, no. of corrupted packets forwarded, node energy, etc. for the creation of optimal monitoring and management system to detect the network anomalies.</p><p>Another watchdog based approach has been adopted by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> for detection of selfish and misbehaving nodes. Quality of Service Optimized Link State Routing (QOS-OLSR) protocol has been used as routing protocol. A two-phase motivational approach has been used by the author which is able to motivate the malicious nodes to behave normally and cooperatively by giving incentives in the form of reputation which gets linked to the network`s service during the formation of the cluster and detect the selfish misbehaving nodes after the cluster formation. For the detection of selfish misbehaving nodes, Dempster-Shafer based cooperative watchdog is used in which selfish and misbehaving nodes are detected after aggregation of appropriate evidence from different watchdogs. Advantage: As per the simulation results, the proposed 2-phase watchdog based approach provides improved detection rate and reduction in false positive and selfish nodes in the network, without hindering the QOS and network stability. Disadvantage: Only capable of addressing selfish and misbehaving nodes performing actions for their own benefits like over speeding, packet dropping, etc. A watchdog based approach is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for the detection of nodes with greedy behavior in VANET by making use of input short periodic traffic traces. The proposed algorithm is based on the combination of linear regression, statistical method, and watchdog based IDS. Linear regression method is used for differentiating between a normal network and a network under attack. The complete working of the proposed algorithm is explained in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">12</ref>. Initially, the short period traffic traces are collected, and the correlation coefficient is calculated. If the value of the Correlation coefficient of linear regression straight is not close to one, then there exist chances of greedy behavior in the network and then the watchdog is used for the monitoring of the network on the basis of metrics especially for VANET like transmission time, no. of login attempts of each node, average connection duration. Advantage: The proposed algorithm is passive, non-resource hungry, doesn't require any modification in MAC layer and can be executed by any node in the network. Disadvantage: Percentage of greedy nodes in the network for evaluation is not mentioned. Also, the approach is suitable for the detection of greedy nodes only, and it is not mentioned what type of greedy behavior this approach was used for evaluation. Future: Use of the proposed algorithm for the   <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> where a protocol independent watchdog component is claimed to be produced. A simple technique in which packets received by the node under consideration from its neighbor for forwarding are counted and checked how many packets are actually been forwarded by the node is used for the detection of malicious nodes. However, factors like collision and signal noise can also lead to packets dropping. So the authors have introduced a tolerance threshold in which packet loose tolerance is defined. Node is declared as malicious if the packet dropping by a node exceeds the tolerance threshold. Devaluation technique is used in the proposed system for reducing the false negative problem that consists in decrease the weight of the oldest received packets along the time, and thus their influence of considered packets in the computation of the tolerance threshold. Advantage: Tolerance threshold and devaluation are proposed for reducing the false positive and false negative in the detection system. Disadvantage: This approach is designed to detect black hole attack only. Also, the watchdog techniques involve working of nodes in promiscuous mode to listen to the other node`s traffic. This can lead to privacy and security issues, and also this approach can introduce unnecessary traffic into the network affecting the whole network performance. Future Scope: In a future version of the proposed system, authors aim to improve the tolerance threshold by making it more dynamic and use Bayesian filtering to reduce the false positive and improve the detection of the watchdog.</p><p>A DMN algorithm has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> that improves the existing DMV algorithm by selecting optimal verifiers for the malicious nodes detection. The proposed approach is nodecentric in which suitable verifiers satisfying certain threshold values are selected that monitors the other nodes for packet drops and duplicate packet injection. Parameters like distrust value, load and distance are used for the election of verifiers. Verifier mark a node as malicious whose distrust value in terms of packet drop and packet duplication exceeds the specific threshold to reduce the false positives. Advantage: Instead of using all trustworthy nodes for monitoring purpose, only selective nodes satisfying certain threshold values are used as watchdogs. This helps in network resource utilization and thus improves the network performance. Disadvantage: Only work with packet dropping and packet duplication injection attack. Also monitoring the traffic of other nodes can cause congestion and privacy issues. This proposal has a probability of producing a lot of false positives as node dropping packets because of some problem will also be considered as malicious. Also, the node density considered for evaluation of the proposed system is considerably low. The threshold value for marking the node as malicious is not mentioned anywhere in the article by the authors. Future Scope: Optimization techniques like PSO, GA, etc. can be used for the selection of verifiers in the proposed algorithm for the improvement in detection. A technique for malicious node prevention can be used in the near future. Along with it, deployment of the proposed method in real scenarios will be done to test its performance in real traffic.</p><p>Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> have proposed a data-centric approach in contrast to existing entity-specific approaches in which instead of looking for misbehaving nodes, this approach works by identifying the information as good and bad. False information initiated by misbehaving nodes are identified by monitoring the alerts generated by the node and their corresponding actions. On identification of false information sent by a node, Watchdogs send this information to the respective CA which imposes fine on the culprit node instead of isolating it from the network. The imposition of penalty on the node is done to discourage the node from sending the false messages and eventually reduces the network load consumption required in node credentials revoking process. ECMV approach is used in the proposed scheme for the authentication purpose. Advantage: This approach does not make use of any voting or majority decisions for detection of false information and misbehaving nodes making this approach free from Sybil attacks. Also, a new reward and penalty system is used instead of isolating the misbehaving nodes. This reduces the total computation and communication wastage involved in revoking and isolating the credentials of misbehaving nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disadvantage:</head><p>The technique of only using fine as a penalty on the culprit nodes can work for greedy nodes only and cannot for malicious nodes whose aim is to harm others. Simulation parameters and simulation scenario including the type of simulator used is not mentioned clearly. Future Scope: Realtime simulation of the proposed system will be done in the future. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Anomaly based IDS Approaches</head><p>Anomaly based IDSs compares the system`s activity at some instant of time with the normal behavior of the system. In case of any event deviating from normal behavior is considered as malicious and alert is generated for the same. This approach is capable of dealing with newer and out of rule attacks also. However, this approach has some drawbacks and challenges also associated with it in the way that any normal event even if it is not matching with the normal behavior of the network will be marked as malicious. And thus setting up of the optimal normal behavior is an important challenge for reducing false positives rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66]</ref>.</p><p>For setting up the normal behavior profile of the network, statistical and machine learning approaches are used mostly but imposes a heavy burden on resource constrained nodes. So anomaly based approaches should consider this in particular.</p><p>A version of anomaly based IDS has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> which uses statistical approach and traffic model for the detection of false information attack especially in emergency messages and rogue nodes respectively. This IDS is deployed on every node in the network and using the statistical approach is able to detect as well as contain the damage by taking corrective measures. In order to make the proposed IDS to detect the attack, IDS is trained under normal conditions such that any deviations from that can make the IDS to generate alarms. In the proposed IDS, every node exchanges parameter information like speed, calculated average flow, average density, etc. with other nodes in its vicinity using the Greenshields's model. Since all the vehicles have a parameter value of all other nodes in its vicinity, so each vehicle has the information of all other nodes. Mean value is calculated by each vehicle and is compared with other vehicle`s mean. All the vehicles in the same vicinity will calculate almost same flow value (mean). Then t-test is applied to detect false value reported by any malicious vehicle. If there is a significant difference between received value and vehicle`s own calculated value, then that node is monitored and accepts its data temporarily. The t-test is applied to the further parameters received by that node. If the value of the t-test is within a given acceptance value, then the data is accepted else rejected. If data is rejected, then that node is marked as a rogue node and further messages from that node are rejected. Advantage: The proposed IDS is able to detect the fake message injection attack by just analyzing the data without making use of any trust or reputation based techniques. Also, this IDS is also efficient to detect the Sybil attack in which nodes are faking their locations. The proposed IDS is independent of any infrastructure like RSU or any expensive hardware. Disadvantage: This approach fails to detect the rogue node when the rogue node coordinates and modifies (increases or decreases) the parameter value to make the received flow value equal to the calculated values. In that case, there will be no anomaly, and the proposed IDS will not be able to detect the rogue nodes. Also, the overhead of Proposed IDS increases with increase in a number of rogue nodes. Future: In future, this IDS will be extended to detect other attacks in VANET like DOS, fake location reporting or location spoofing attacks.</p><p>A Deep Neural Network (DNN) based IDS has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for enhancing the security of vehicular based network like CAN network. In proposed DNN based IDS, suitable feature vectors for attack detection are extracted from vehicular network packets which are then used for training the proposed DNN based IDS. So the trained DNN based IDS checks every packet for maliciousness and thus identifies and report any malicious attack on the vehicle. Deep learning techniques like initiating the parameters via unsupervised pre-training of deep belief network (DBN) is used in the proposed IDS for enhancing the detection accuracy. All the CAN broadcasted CAN packets are monitored and analyzed by the proposed IDS for attack detection. The proposed IDS is tested for CAN bus networks, and the traffic for simulation is generated using Open Car Test-Bed and OCTANE packet generator. 200,000 packets are generated for the simulation out of which 70 % packets was used for training the IDS and rest 30% was used for testing purpose. The proposed IDS`s performance was evaluated and compared with other machine learning techniques like SVM, ANN, etc. on the basis of security evaluation parameters like false positive rate, false negative rate and detection rate and simulation results claim that the proposed IDS provides real-time response to the attack and significantly improve the detection accuracy in CAN. Advantage: Proposed IDS Scheme uses deep learning technique for improving the capability and the detection accuracy of ANN. Limitation: No information regarding simulation parameters are provided. Also, there is no information regarding the type of attack considered for evaluation the IDS is provided.</p><p>Similarly, another anomaly based IDS solution named CEAP has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. CEAP is a multi-decision intelligent anomaly based IDS that is designed to cope with the hurdles of security challenges in VANET. CEAP uses SVM for identification and categorization of vehicles on the road as cooperative or malicious. To cope with high mobility problem in VANET, Clustering protocol called QOS-OLSR is used which maintains the cluster stability and considers the mobility metrics of vehicles during clusters formation. CEAP consists of four phases: a) Data collection, in which certain node including CH acts as watchdogs and continuously monitors the behavior of the MPR nodes and checks whether the MPR is actually forwarding the packets or not. If not, then that MPR is considered temporary Malicious, b) Data Exchange, in which all the watchdogs in the same cluster exchange their finding with each other to arrive at some decision, c) Data Analysis, which is used to enhance the detection accuracy of CEAP in which SVM is used for confirming and classifying the suspected MPR and finally d) Data Propagation, in which information regarding the malicious MPR is propagated to all the other nodes in the network. Packet dropping attack is considered for evaluation of proposed IDS scheme. VanetMobiSim is used as traffic simulator and MATLAB for implementation of network related algorithms. CEAP performance was compared with other existing IDS solutions, and it outperforms them in terms of false positive rate, accuracy and detection time. Advantage: Proposed IDS reduces the training set size of SVM by restricting the data collection, storage, analysis and forwarding to only selective nodes only. Limitation: Cluster Head disseminates the suitable information regarding the malicious node to nodes in other clusters. But there may be the probability of cluster head also being malicious. This scenario is not considered in the article, and it is assumed that the Cluster head will always be non-malicious. Future: In a future version of CEAP, the probability of all the involved nodes including Cluster head, MPR and normal nodes to act maliciously will be considered. Such scenario requires a fully distributed model independent of the behavior of any nodes. Another future direction is the use of reward and penalty system to motivate the cooperative nodes and punish the malicious nodes. Also, a future version of CEAP can be extended to classify a malicious node based on the type of attack it is performing.</p><p>Another hierarchical anomaly based IDS has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> for BUSNET in which bus nodes are designated as cluster heads which collect the routing control and data messages from all the vehicles and forward them to the access points deployed along the RSUs. Using this information, access points get a global picture of the whole network and detects the attacks occurring in the network by analyzing the data flow. For enabling the anomaly based IDS to detect deviations in the network behavior, the neural network is used which using learning process gets to know about the normal network behavior. After the training of the neural network based IDS, it becomes capable and detects the malicious attacks by analyzing the network control messages and data packets in real time. In case of any deviations, an alarm is generated. DOS attack is used for testing the performance of the proposed IDS. Advantage: The proposed IDS claims to provide low false positives. Disadvantage: The proposed IDS is not able to tell the type of attack taking place. It just generates an alarm whenever the behavior value exceeds the threshold value.</p><p>Similar anomaly based IDS has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> in which authors have come up with another anomaly based IDS solution that uses Feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and support vector machine (SVM) for the providing protection against the grey hole and rushing attacks. Initially, traffic is generated using the SUMO mobility generator which is fed to the network simulator for the generation of trace files. The generated trace file consists of both normal and abnormal behavior. Then suitable features are extracted from the trace file using Proportional Overlapping Score (POS) which are then fuzzified and are used to train both SVM based and FFNN based IDS. The complete flow is explained using Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>. Simulation results show that the FFNN based IDS is more efficient compared to the SVM based IDS. Apart from detection of aforementioned attacks, proposed IDS scheme consists of a novel response system that automatically puts the infected vehicles into the safe mode to prevent the other vehicles from getting infected and to protect the lives of other drivers. Advantage: Proportional Overlapping Score (POS) is used for extracting valuable features from the available features set in trace file which considerably improves the detection accuracy of the proposed IDS. Disadvantage: Node density for evaluating the performance of the proposed IDS is kept very less.</p><p>Same above author in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> uses Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for the detection of DOS and black hole attack in VANET. First, the malicious behavior is generated by editing the AODV routing protocol. Then mobility is generated using SUMO and which is fed to the network simulator NS2 for generation of trace files. The trace file contains some useful features which are then used to train and test the proposed IDS. The proposed system is trained and tested using LDA and QDA to differentiate between normal and abnormal behavior. The complete flow of the proposed work is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">14</ref>. Advantage: The advantage of the proposed IDS over incumbent security systems is that it detects the attack before it causes significant damage. Also, the proposed IDS is not dependent on any expensive hardware and RSUs. Disadvantage: Number of nodes on which the proposed IDS is tested is kept very less. Also, two separate techniques, i.e. LDA and QDA are used and applied separately on a dataset for training and testing of IDS which can lead to false positives and ambient results. Future: To use RSU deployed IDS and also the use of AI techniques like k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (k-NN) for enhancing the security of the VANET.</p><p>Another lightweight anomaly based IDS optimized and inspired by dolphin behavior has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref> in which dolphin swarm optimization is used for enhancing the performance of the IDS in terms of detection time, false positive rate and detection rate. The Proposed anomaly based system claims to provide higher performance than the existing compared security frameworks. Advantage: This IDS makes use of dolphin swarm behavior of hunting for the detection of intrusions. This IDS also uses the concept of multi-cluster head, thus reducing the overburdening of Cluster Heads (CH) in dense network scenarios. Also, this IDS scheme claims to achieve all three goals of security i.e. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Future Scope: Deployment of this multicluster head based Dolphin swarm optimized IDS along with other proactive honeypot solutions for enhanced performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Hybrid detection based IDS Approaches</head><p>Hybrid based IDS utilizes the power of both Anomaly based IDS and Signature based IDS for detection of malicious nodes. The human-created attack patterns in the form of rules are clubbed with the anomaly based IDS technique to form an enhanced version of IDS called as Hybrid IDS. Hybrid IDS to some extent is believed to deal with known attacks as well as the attacks whose signature are not defined by the administrator.</p><p>A hybrid based IDS is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> in which anomaly based IDS is incorporated using artificial neural networks (ANN) for the detection of DOS attacks in VANET. Network behavior and features stored as trace file are used by the ANN for the detection of malicious nodes performing DOS attack. Drawback: Performance of the proposed system is not compared with other existing IDS. Also, the proposed system is evaluated on only 30 nodes which are very less when compared with other existing approaches and real-time scenarios. Also, no description of misuse based IDS is given anywhere in the whole article.</p><p>Same authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> have come with another hybrid based IDS approach but this time for the detection malicious nodes performing black hole attack. The earlier approach has low detection rate and high positive rate, so to improve the accuracy and detection rate, fuzzification on features selected via Proportional Overlapping Scores method (POS) is done which is then further used for the training of ANN. IDS deployment is done on the nodes instead of RSUs for the prevention of attacks in no RSU zone also. Advantage: Using POS, the training features set size is reduced, and only optimal features are selected from available features. Disadvantage: Number of nodes in the simulation is kept only 40, and no comparison of the proposed system with the existing systems is done.</p><p>Another hybrid based IDS has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> which uses Proportional Overlapping Score (POS) for fetching of optimal and suitable features from available features in Kyoto Benchmark Dataset. Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is used for the detection of DOS attacks in VANET using the training set obtained from the POS. Proposed neural based IDS are deployed on all the vehicles for the detection. Advantage: The proposed system work by reducing the redundant and not-required features which improve the detection capability and reduces the false positive rate. Disadvantage: This approach is capable of addressing the DOS attacks only. Also, the performance of the proposed system is not compared with any other existing security framework. Information like Simulator used, no. of nodes, and other simulation parameters are missing.</p><p>AECFV is another hybrid based IDS introduced in [14] that aims to defend the VANET environment from intruders and malicious users. AECFV provides defense against critical attacks like wormhole, selective forwarding, packet dropping, packet duplication and Sybil attack. AECFV consists of three main intrusion detection agents: LIDS (Local Intrusion Detection System) deployed on each node in a cluster, GIDS (Global Intrusion Detection System) deployed on Cluster Head (CH) of every cluster, and GDS (Global Decision System) positioned at every Road Side Unit (RSU). LIDS uses the signature based detection approach for attaining high accuracy and low false positives. GIDS uses hybrid detection approach (rule based and anomaly based using SVM) for the detection and mitigation of threats from the network. GDS agent is used for maintaining and tracking the trust level of each node in the network. Advantage: AECFV outperforms other compared security frameworks in terms detection accuracy, false positive and detection time. Disadvantage: Malicious node detected by LIDS are sent for confirmation to GIDS which can add an extra delay in detection. Future Work: To deploy and implement AECFV in the real working environment and to compare the simulation and experimental results.</p><p>Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> have proposed a lightweight hybrid IDS for the detection of message injection attack in CAN network. Signature based detection engine is used in the detection of common attacks while anomaly based detection engine is employed for detection of message injection attack by analyzing the message frequency. Three variations of message injection attack viz. a) message injection of single CAN ID, b) message injection of multiple CAN IDs and c) mass injection of CAN messages leading to DOS attack is detected using the proposed IDS. So if IDS finds that the CAN message which is a broadcast message is sent in a time interval less than the set threshold, then that message is marked as malicious. For evaluation, K-car is used as a testing vehicle and KVASER CAN interface is used for connecting CAN bus. Advantage: Proposed IDS is lightweight and require less computational power. Also simulation result of shows that proposed IDS requires less detection time and produces 0 % false positives. Limitation: The proposed system is capable of detecting only 3 version of message injection attacks, i.e. single CAN ID injection, multiple CAN ID injection and mass injection (DOS) in CAN network. Also, there may arise some situations when the CAN warning broadcast message has to be sent frequently, then this IDS will lead to false alarms. Future Work: As future of this work, CAN message sequence will be analyzed for the detection of any irregularity in messages. However, analyzing the message sequence require more computational power but at the same time will improve the detection accuracy of the IDS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Cross-layer based IDS</head><p>From the survey conducted, one important loophole that is found in IDS for VANET is that most of the proposed works focusses only on a single specific layer of VANET without considering the other layers. This is one of the important reason for low performance and detection capability of the available IDS approaches. It may happen that the IDS deployed at application layer detects the threats of application layer only, neglecting attack from other layers. So in cross-layer IDS, IDS agent is deployed on multiple layers of IDS for the detection of different threats designed for different layers. Detection results and event logs from different layers are gathered to arrive at a decision.</p><p>A modular cross-layer based IDS using context information and knowledge from different layers and different sources like GPS, radar, and sensors along with the knowledge from applications with the aim to enhance the existing security in VANETs has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The proposed approach is not anomaly based nor signature based IDS. Events from the different layer and from different identities are combined to detect the anomaly and intrusion in the network. Every node will be equipped with specialized modules for collecting audit data on different layers. A local decision module receives continuously audit data summaries from the other modules and analyses them with the aid of additional information, available from other non-network devices, such as GPS, sensors, and radar (side channel data or context data). Various other modules apart from central decision modules like network monitoring modules which is in charge of collecting communication data within node`s transmission range, application evaluation module responsible for evaluation of safety warning messages using the knowledge from applications along with sensor data provided by the context information module is used in the proposed IDS and is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">15</ref>. Limitations: Only the theoretical proposal of the cross-layer IDS has been given by the authors. No simulation and practical implementation of the proposed approach has been provided. Future: As an enhancement to the proposed IDS, application knowledge and information from location aided routing and addressing will be combined. Also, the proposed system will be enhanced to detect the safety warning message arriving from different directions and to make the system capable of detecting the malicious nodes spoofing their locations. Also, a certain level of trust is required among the nodes participating in cooperative decision making. So in the near future, dynamic trust establishment between the communicating nodes will be used.</p><p>Another cross-layer based IDS has been proposed by authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> which aims to deal with black hole and denial of service attack targeting the QOS-OLSR in order to improve the detection rate of existing Watchdog based solutions in VANET. In the proposed security detection mechanism, separate threat detector has been proposed for different layers and then integrating the results of each detector for efficient mitigation of black hole attack as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">16</ref>. The proposed Crosslayer based IDS uses two detection scheme that allows the information exchange between two and three layers respectively. The first detection mechanism allows the information to be exchanged among physical and network layers while the second detection mechanism used in the proposed IDS allows information exchange between physical, MAC and network layer for efficient and accurate detection. Intrusion detector in physical layer consists of a signature key based detector where each legitimate nodes are assigned a signature key. Each watchdog node uses this signature key and maximum likelihood test to test whether the received signal is from a malicious or cooperative node. On detecting that the signal is from the malicious node, then that signal is dropped else the signal is pass to the next layer i.e. network layer for further detection confirmation. In network layer, the signal marked as malicious is further validated using the implemented cooperative watchdog mechanism to further test the maliciousness of the received signal. Depending only on one detection mechanism like of physical layer can lead to false positives because of factors like high noise and physical layer channel interference. This multiple layer defense reduces the false positives and improves the detection accuracy. Finally, in the MAC Layer detection, the ratio of the number of RTS packets sent to the number of RTS packets received among all the neighbors is computed. In case of any discrepancy, it is indicated that the packet loss is due to the collision and not due to an intrusion. Also, the watchdogs in the same cluster and monitoring nodes from other layers cooperate with each other to exchange information and to arrive at a unified final decision. Disadvantage: Proposed approach is designed to tackle a single attack i.e. blackhole attack only. Also, the number of nodes in simulations is kept to only 60 which is considerably less compared to other solutions. Also although the proposed IDS provides high detection rate and low false positive rate but authors has not considered detection time which is an important parameter for highly delay sensitive network like VANETs. Future: Application and MAC layers attacks like broadcast transmission leading to DOS attack will be considered. Also for enhancing the capability of Proposed Cross-layer IDS, the authors plan to adopt a reputation based solution in which each monitoring node will be configured with a reputation based on its performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6) Honeypot based Proactive IDS</head><p>A honeypot based proactive IDS has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref> for dealing with selfish nodes performing selfish activities for saving their resources and other benefits. Various variations of selfish nodes such as energy based, speed based, memory based, etc. exist in literature with different solutions for their mitigation. In this proposed work, energy based selfish vehicular nodes which drops the packets once its residual energy becomes less than 50 %, are addressed.</p><p>The proposed Honeypot Selfishness Detection (HPSD) makes use of bait concept for the detection of the selfish nodes. In this approach, once any vehicle drops the packet then it is added to the suspicion selfish node list, and then the bait based honeypot approach is performed on the nodes present in the suspicion list. In normal AODV routing protocol, if any node has to send a packet to some other node in the network, the routing path is created first in which first the source node`s routing table is checked for the presence of path to the destination. If the path is available, then the source node uses that path and sends the packet directly. But in other case when no path is available, source node broadcasts the RREQ packet to all its neighbor nodes. In normal scenario, the cooperative node rebroadcasts to its neighbors until the path to the destination is not found. Since the source node is also the 1-hop neighbor of all its neighboring nodes so it will also receive the same RREQ packet sent by it. So every time the source node checks the character of its neighbor nodes using the above concept of receiving back RREQ packet from its neighbors. In case of any missing RREQ packet from any of its neighbors, then that node is added to the suspicion list and source node sends the bait RREQ packet to that suspicious node. If a suspicious node drops that bait RREQ packet, then that node is marked as suspicious, and all path through that detected suspicious nodes is then deleted. The complete working of the HPSD is explained using the flowchart shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">17</ref>. Advantage: This approach improves the packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay. With this approach, the usefulness of honeypot mechanism for the detection of malicious nodes is seen which can be extended and enhanced for better detection rate. Disadvantage: This approach introduces extra unnecessary traffic and overhead into the network by making use of multiple fake bait message for the detection of selfish nodes. Also, this approach is used for the detection of energy based selfish node only. Future Scope: This concept of honeypot based IDS for the detection of selfish nodes can be extended and enhanced for the detection of other known and unknown attacks also.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Validation Strategy</head><p>Validation strategy means how a proposed system is validated for its accuracy and correctness within the defined objectives. This checks whether the proposed model is working as expected and providing the desired level of accurateness or not. There exist various validation strategies for testing the performance and accuracy of a proposed model. In this review article, to check which IDS scheme for VANETs is providing the desired level of results, these IDS schemes are checked for the type of validation strategies being used by them. Each validation strategy has its own limitations and benefits. This categorization of IDS in VANET by validation strategies will help in evaluating the maturity level of IDS in VANET. For validation purposes, following set of validation techniques mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref> are being used in our survey: a) Empirical: use of empirical methods like use of dedicated physical testbed for evaluation b) Simulation: use of simulation methods using network and traffic simulators. c) Theoretical: use of theoretical arguments and concepts to prove the results. d) None: no validation strategies are employed From the total of 24 reviewed papers, we have found that 4 papers used the empirical technique as validation strategy for the validation of their proposed models <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.

Every study is using its own different validation strategy. Even for simulation based validation, different simulators, both network and traffic, are being used with no valid reason for their choice for similar attacks like DOS. Also in some papers it is not clearly mentioned which attack the author is considering to test their proposed IDS model while in some papers, the proposed model is compared with other existing techniques using some other attacks or without mentioning the attack considered. Also, the percentage of malicious nodes considered for evaluation purpose plays a crucial role, and in most of the articles <ref type="bibr">[4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16, 18, 21, 23-25, 44, 45]</ref>, this parameter is not mentioned clearly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. ISSUES, CONCERNS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Drawbacks of Existing IDS</head><p>In this section, drawbacks and challenges in the deployment of IDS for VANET are enumerated from the exhaustive literature survey and is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Real World Deployment and testing</head><p>There is a need of a real-world deployment of IDS in real traffic scenarios for the purpose of evaluating the performance of proposed IDS. Although existing IDS schemes are available with their simulation and statistical analysis but that schemes need to be tested in real and unideal traffic environment to prove their applicability and performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Attack Specific IDS:</head><p>Existing IDS in literature are designed for certain attacks only and are capable of addressing one or two attacks only. So it is a difficult task to club these existing IDS proposals addressing different individual attacks. So researchers are required to propose a generalized IDS addressing all the major attacks possible in VANET environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Requirement of Lightweight and Resource Friendly IDS</head><p>Deployment of IDS in VANET is done either on RSU or nodes which are movable vehicles. Vehicles in VANET are mostly resource constraint and deployment of heavy and complex IDS can hinder the performance of the VANET network. So there is a need of IDS that maintains a balance between performance, effectiveness, and detection, before their deployment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Pros and Cons of proposed schemes are missing</head><p>After analyzing the papers, we found that the pros and cons of each proposed technique are missing. Also, the reason for the choice of different parameters like simulator, validation strategy, deployment location, detection technique is not mentioned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Data Set:</head><p>The attacks in VANET are enormous and emerging. Existing data set used in literature like KDD-99 <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref> are outdated, and attacks specifically for VANET are missing in them. So there is a dire requirement of a specialized dataset containing pattern of most of the attacks of VANET. This data set can help researchers in testing their proposed IDS detection performance against various attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6) Deployment Location in VANET</head><p>The position of deployment of IDS in VANET plays a very major role from performance and resource utilization point of view. Deploying an IDS in every component of VANET and on every node can affect the performance of the network. So there is a great need to decide the location of IDS from performance and security point of view. Deploying of IDS in every node and RSU can help in achieving better network security as all the information flowing in the network will be analyzed in this way. However, this deployment strategy can add unnecessary overhead on both network as well as on the nodes hindering the network performance. Also, it will eat the limited resources of the nodes causing them to malfunction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7) Inability in detection and mitigation of Zero Day attacks:</head><p>Existing IDS approaches in literature are concerned with detection and mitigation of existing attacks only. But as the security is an emerging topic and new threats keep on adding, so there is a need for a security strategy and framework to deal with these new Zero-day attacks. This can be achieved by making use of various pre-attack detection straggles like the use of honeypots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8) Inability in Beforehand Prediction of Threats:</head><p>Almost all of the existing IDS based solutions in literature for VANETs and VANETs Cloud have their focus on the detection of current attacks only and they lack in predicting the attacks beforehand. There should be a framework that can predict the attacks beforehand. The incorporation and introduction of Intrusion Prediction based System (IPS) capable of sensing the attacks beforehand will definitely enhance the security of VANETs to a greater extent. One such Intrusion Prediction System (IPS) work is available in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref> which can serve as a good base for developing more such frameworks for enhancing the VANETs security.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. PROPOSED HONEYPOT BASED INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM FOR VANET</head><p>From the exhaustive review conducted above, we have come to a conclusion that each type of IDS, whether it is signature based or anomaly based IDS, have some challenges and drawbacks associated with them in VANETs. VANET is an emerging network and newer attacks keep on adding, and almost all the existing IDS in literature are designed for specific and one or two attacks. So there is a need of security framework that should be capable of automatically handling the unknown and zero-day attacks.</p><p>We have seen the possibility of using honeypot based IDS in VANETs in the above-conducted survey. Although almost negligible work is done in the use of honeypot mechanism for IDS. But honeypot mechanism has already proved its worth as detection system in traditional networks.</p><p>So keeping the aforementioned challenges and requirement in mind, we have proposed a Bait based Intrusion Detection System also called as Honeypot based IDS (HPIDS) that is made capable of dealing with both existing attacks as well as unknown and zero-day attacks in VANETs.</p><p>In our proposed HPIDS scheme, every node in the network will be equipped with signature based IDS for the detection of known and common in-rule based threats. The reason for the choice of Signature based IDS in our proposed framework over other IDS types is some of its advantages in VANETs like less complex and less time incurring threat detection logic, less false positive, high accuracy for in rules attacks, etc. Now for the detection of out of rule attacks, few node in the network will act as bait or honeypot to tempt the malicious nodes to attack them. Whenever the malicious node performs some attack on the honeypot nodes, their activity will get logged and also the type of attack pattern used by them will also get saved by the honeypot node. Afterwards, the corresponding attack signature is generated by the honeypot node and is transferred to the other normal node`s signature based IDS ruleset making them capable of detecting attacks which were not in their database. On receiving the newly created attack signature rule, each node checks their existing ruleset for the presence of any similar rules. If the signature rule received is already present in the node`s ruleset then the received rule is discarded else the rule is added to the existing rule database of the node.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">20</ref> graphically illustrates the working of our proposed HPIDS scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Advantages of Proposed HPIDS Framework 1) Zero-Day attacks Detection</head><p>Proposed HPIDS framework is a combination of both IDS and honeypot making it capable of detecting both known as well as zero-day attacks. Thus, making it more secure and robust. Honeypot module deployed in it will be used for the detection of zero-day attacks while the IDS module will be for the detection of known attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) A more Generalized and non-attack specific Framework</head><p>Most of the existing IDS based and other security frameworks in literature for VANETs and VANETs Clouds as studied in above study have considered and are capable of dealing with only one or two attacks. The scope of proposed HPIDS is not made specific and limited to one or two attacks but can cover general attacks also which was a problem with existing IDS based solutions covering one or two attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Lightweight and Less Resource Hungry</head><p>Considering the resource constraint issues in VANET, proposed HPIDS is lightweight in terms of less resource consumption for its working.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) High Detection Rate</head><p>Introduction of honeypot modules in the nodes along with the IDS has increased the detection rate of the attacks as both known as well as unknown attacks are covered by this framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Auto-generation and distribution of Zero-day attack`s signature to IDS nodes with zero human intervention.</head><p>Information and training regarding any out of scope attacks logged by the honeypot module are auto-generated by the honeypot and is then circulated to all the IDS for making them capable of detecting that unknown attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Important Considerations for Proposed HPIDS Framework</head><p>Important considerations that need to be taken care during the design and deployment of Proposed HPIDS framework are:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Choice of Honeypot Node</head><p>Choice of honeypot node plays a crucial role in the efficient working of our proposed HPIDS framework. The task of honeypot node can be assigned either to a) RSUs or b) Nodes. The decision of making RSUs as honeypot node contains both benefits as well as some major shortcomings. Since as explained above, the honeypot node has to perform some resource consuming tasks like logging of malicious node`s activities, automatic generation of rules against the logged attack patterns, etc. so only nodes rich in resources should be made as a honeypot. In this way, RSU is the best contender for acting as Honeypot.</p><p>But the RSUs are not uniformly deployed, and in remote areas where there are limited RSU deployed, the decision of making RSUs as honeypot will fail. So Cluster Head (CH) or nodes with high resources in term of energy, storage, Bandwidth, Computation Capability should be elected as Honeypot. For the same task of finding among the nodes an optimal honeypot node, Hybrid Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision making (HF-MCDM) approach can be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Density of Honeypot Nodes</head><p>Since the VANETs is highly dynamic and changing network where sometimes the traffic becomes highly dense whereas sometimes it becomes very sparse, so optimal number of nodes to be made as Honeypot is another important consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Choice of IDS to use along with honeypot</head><p>The type of IDS to be deployed on individual nodes is another important factor that requires discussion as every IDS type whether it is signature, anomaly, hybrid or cross-layer based IDS, has its own advantages and shortcomings. But from the above-conducted survey, we found Signature based IDS can be the better choice over the other IDS techniques considering the nature of VANETs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>VANET and VANET Cloud is a new innovation in the field of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) with the aim to improve the driving experience, road safety, fuel efficiency, resource utilization, etc. But because of association of VANETs and VANETs Cloud with life critical and delay sensitive network and also because of some inherent features of it, this network is highly prone to attacks by intruders and selfish users. Therefore, a security solution for VANETs and VANETs Cloud need to be developed and focused upon. IDS which has already proved its worth in securing the traditional network is the first choice in enhancing security in VANETs also. But deployment and design of IDS in VANETs and VANET Cloud require special considerations.</p><p>In this paper, we have come forward with an in-depth and comprehensive study on IDS and Honeypots based security mechanism for VANET and VANET Cloud technologies for providing pre and post defense against various malevolent attacks. We analyzed and studied 25 research works from 2000 to 2017 that proposed IDS scheme for VANET and VANET Cloud or have used some detection scheme for VANETs that could be a part of an IDS. IDS for VANET and VANET Cloud are studied and categorized on the basis of important attributes like detection mechanism, deployment location and validation strategy in use. Furthermore, the possibility of use of honeypot based solutions for enhancing security in VANET and VANET cloud and for detection of existing and unknown attacks are also analyzed, and an architecture of Honeypot based IDS (HPIDS) has been proposed along with its design and deployment consideration for better detection rate.</p><p>On the basis of our study and findings we observed that, although the research on VANET has started in early 2000, security is one among the important area that needs attention for error-free deployment of VANET. IDS based solutions are adopted and proposed by many security researchers, but there are still various issues (e.g. IDS deployment location, IDS architecture, the trade-off between parameters like accuracy, resource consumption, and detection delay) that still need further attention and thus is still incipient. The existing proposed solutions cover only limited attacks and are designed for specific attacks only. Moreover, which detection technique and placement strategy are more optimal for VANET environment is not clear. Finally, it is worth mentioning that validation strategies are not fixed, and different validation techniques and simulators are being used by the researchers.</p><p>Also, very less to no work has been done so far on analyzing the deployment possibilities and possible challenges in the use of IDS based techniques in VANET Cloud Environment for malicious attack detections.</p><p>From this study and results, we hope that the budding and active researchers working in this area can benefit. As a future research, following issues and challenges in deployment of IDS in VANET and VANET Cloud can be stressed on 1) choice of optimal deployment location for improved detection and enhanced network performance; 2) detection of zero-day and unknown attacks; 3) creation of up-to-date dataset for newer attack detection capability testing; 4) to find pros and cons of various detection schemes and deployment strategies; 5) to improve and use of some generalized validation strategies; 6) to develop some auto alert detection and response management systems; 7) beforehand prediction of occurrence of Intrusions. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

VI. INTRUSION DETECTION IN VANET Different types of IDS exists with different threat detection strategies, different deployment locations, and different reaction policies. So IDS for VANETs can be categorized further on the basis of aforementioned and crucial parameters to make it easy to choose a suitable IDS for VANET as shown in Table VI. Fig. 8 shows different classifications of IDS possible in VANET and VANET Clouds. IDS in VANET can be classified as follows: A. IDS based on Deployment Location Deployment location of IDS can have a huge impact on IDS`s performance. IDSs can have different deployment locations depending on the network scenario. IDS in VANET can further be categorized on the basis of deployment location in VANET. Deployment location of IDS in VANET plays a very important role in both detection rate as well as on the network performance. IDS can be deployed in following three different ways in VANET: a) Distributed and Individual Node IDS (Decentralized IDS) b) Centralized RSU based IDS c) Centralized Cluster Head Deployed IDS d) Hybrid location deployed IDS Different consideration needs to be kept in mind during IDS deployment in VANET. Each deployment location category has its own advantage and disadvantage over other deployment location strategy and optimal choice of it have a huge impact on whole network performance and detection accuracy. So IDS deployment location should be done keeping various parameters in mind. The detailed comparison of various deployment strategies for IDS in VANET is shown in TableIV</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>possible types of timing attack in VANET are: a) Node to Node Timing Attack: This type of timing attack is further subcategorized as Simple Node to Node Timing attack and Extended Node to Node Timing attack. The Simple Node to Node Timing attack affects communication which is taking between two nodes i.e. peer to peer communication. The threat level in this type of timing attack is very less as compared to the extended version of the node to node timing attack because only one node is affected by this attack. Consider this scenario in which we have two communicating nodes: A and B and say C is an attacking node. A sends a safety message to B informing it about the accident that took place on the highway and advising it to take the right diversion. But attacker node C intercepts the message and adds a delay of 15 seconds in message causing the node B to go on the path where the accident has taken place. Whereas extended Node to Node Timing attack is more critical because this affects more than one vehicle. This attack targets the vehicles nodes communicating in groups. b) Node to Infrastructure Timing Attack: This type of timing attack is very critical and need to be addressed. Since RSU is the critical part in a VANET environment and attack on RSU can bring down the whole network. In Node to RSU Timing</figDesc><table /></figure>

The proposed IDS is implemented using NS-3 and uses SUMO as mobility generator. The percentage of malicious vehicles is kept as 5 to 50 % and when compared with various existing IDS in VANET on the basis of comparison parameters like detection rate, false positive rate, overhead, etc. and this approach performs better. Advantage: This approach offers a good detection rate of 98 % in the worst case when the number of malicious vehicles is kept to 50 % of the total node. Also, the VBE protocol used with ELIDV reduces the false positive rate. Disadvantage: ELIDV is capable of detecting nodes performing Sybil, blackhole and false information alert attack only. It cannot detect zero-day and out of rule attacks.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Honeypot based vehicular environment and compare the simulation and • Future Scope: To implement the ELIDV in the real traffic experimental results.</cell><cell>• High Detection delays.</cell></row><row><cell>IDS approach</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
