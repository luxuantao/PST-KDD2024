<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we studied a production line of a mattress manufacturing company. A simulation model was modeled in ARENA ® to evaluate the current production process and formulate proposals for improvement. Several scenarios were tested with the validated model, concluding with two proposals-first, a new method for the sheet lining process that allows reducing the resources required, and second, hiring two material handlers to transport the work in process between workstations. Based on our simulation results, the proposed improvements increase overall productivity and satisfy the expected demand.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In today's uncertain macroeconomic environment, organizations are looking for ways to optimize their processes and use their existing resources efficiently. Decision-makers must be cautious when making changes. Those decisions should improve their productivity and the value perceived by stakeholders. However, these decisions must avoid putting their position in the market at risk. As Fullana Belda &amp; Urquía Grande <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> declare, organizations now face even more vigorous competition, and customers are much less captive and more informed about their market. Therefore, companies must optimize their processes. This optimization process implies identifying opportunities for improvement that will enable them to become more competitive, considering the challenges involved in implementing the improvement changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>In this context, discrete-event simulation arises as a suitable tool for decision support. Hosseinpour &amp; Hajihosseini <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Asprion et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> indicate that simulation has gained importance in recent years because it offers the opportunity to design and validate different scenarios without making physical changes in the original system or investing large sums of money. In the company focus of the study, a new commercial strategy promises to increase demand by up to 20%. Therefore, they need to evaluate different scenarios to face this new market condition. However, the company is currently experiencing delivery delays, accumulated inventories, and overload of some workers.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: this first section presents the problem and the use of simulation as a tool for solving it. The second section briefly covers the state of the art that discusses process simulation as a tool for improving productivity and decision-making. The third section displays the application of the case study from the process description to the results obtained. Lastly, the fourth section proposes conclusions and future research directions arising from the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">State of the art</head><p>Discrete-event simulation may be helpful in various fields because it enables studying projects without making significant investments to establish their viability. The literature includes numerous case studies in which simulation was used as a tool for decision-making and increasing the productivity of organizations like in Zahraee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Medvedev et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.Krishnan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> carried out a study at a pneumatic manufacturing company to reduce activities that did not add value, bottlenecks, and processing times to increase productivity. Based on the simulation, the study found that it was possible to eliminate a bottleneck by adjusting the calendar, which increased productivity by 15.81%.</p><p>Onofrejova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> used simulation as a decision-making tool in a chimney production process to optimize production capacity by selecting restrictions based on the simulation model results. The simulation experiments were assessed to increase productivity. On the other hand, Trigueiro de Sousa Junior et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> presented a systematic review on discrete optimization methods based on simulation. This review indicates the most frequent contexts, problems, techniques, tools, and results found in studies based on discrete simulation published in the last five years (2015-2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Case study: A mattress production process</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Current production process</head><p>The studied mattress production process uses ten workstations, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The figure displays the conceptual model for the mattress manufacturing process, showing the different steps of the process and the number of workers per station. The process begins at the foam production station, where the foam towers and cylinders are produced. Then, at the vertical cutting station, they are cut into foam cubes. Then, at the horizontal cutting station, they are converted into foam sheets. The foam cylinders are used to make cushioning sheets at the cushioning station, used at the sidebands and lining stations. At the quilting station, the sidebands and liners are joined to make the boxes. Later, these boxes are used at the closing station to line the foam sheets and perform the process of closing the mattresses. Finally, each mattress is packed, and the process ends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data gathering, coding of the model, and input analysis</head><p>The data were gathered by a study of methods and times. It implies that the processes carried out at each workstation were studied and broken down into more specific activities to take the required samples and obtain reliable data. Then, the model was implemented in Arena® as described in the conceptual model of figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. A probability distribution was specified for each activity using the input analyzer available within Arena®, as explained in Rossetti <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Model validation and verification phase</head><p>Two performance indicators were used to validate the model: the average number of hours used to complete a production order and the maximum average time to produce an order. Based on the company's historical records, the average time to complete an order is 33 hours. Yet, some orders can take longer to complete. In any case, they do not take more than 72 hours to complete. The daily demand for mattresses has a uniform distribution, with a minimum value of 60 and a maximum of 210. A normality test was performed on the data utilized in the present paper to verify whether the normal assumption is satisfied, using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test.</p><p>The initial hypotheses used to corroborate that the simulated model reflects the system operation were based on the average number of hours to complete. The null hypothesis H0 and the alternative hypothesis H1 were expressed as follows:</p><p>: μ (1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">: μ ≤ 33 hours (2)</formula><p>Where μ1 is the average time an order remains in the system in hours. Then, the hypothesis is evaluated by comparing the p-value with the significance level α =0.05.</p><p>To this effect, a preliminary test of the simulation model was run by operating the system over 32 days, the first 2 of which were the warm-up period to stabilize the system. The confidence level used to verify the hypotheses is 95%. The results obtained from the initial test indicates that the average time for an order in the system is μ1 =32.09 hours with a standard deviation σ1=0.75, and the maximum time is μ2 = 68.46 hours with a standard deviation σ2= 2.43.</p><p>The next step is to corroborate that the average time of order in the system is equal to or greater than 33 hours, for which the test statistic was Z= -3.81. The result of the tested hypothesis demonstrates that there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. From the above, we may conclude that the time an order spends in the system in the simulation model is less than or equal to the actual time an order remains in the system.</p><p>Next, the maximum average time an order remains in the system was set as the maximum average time it takes to be processed at the company. As before, we formulate the null hypothesis H0 and the alternative hypothesis H2 expressing both as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">: μ (3) : μ ≤ 72 hours (4)</formula><p>Where μ 2 is the maximum average time, an order remains in the system. Using the same formula as in the previous calculation and with the same confidence interval, we have that: Z= -4.59. This result is not within the confidence interval, so we reject the null hypothesis with a 95% confidence level, corroborating that the maximum average time an order remains in the system is equal to or less than 72 hours. Based on the results of the above tests, we find that the simulation model behaves like the existing system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Definition of the number of replications and initial results</head><p>Once the model was validated, the next step is to determine the number of replicas required to obtain reliable data. To this effect, we use the half-width ratio proposed by Rossetti <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">≅ (5)</formula><p>Where n0 is the number of initial replications, h0 is the initial value of the half-width from the pilot run of n0 replications, and h is the desired half-width. Based on this equation, the optimal number of replicas required to obtain reliable data was calculated. A pilot run with the initial number of replications set at value n0=30 was carried out to calculate the number of repetitions. The desired half-width was set at one hour.</p><p>As a result of the data analysis, it was confirmed that the number of replications required for some of the items had been covered by the initial replications, such as boxes, cushioned cloth, closing mattresses, and ready mattresses. On the other hand, the foam towers require 1002 replications to obtain reliable data. This was the number of repetitions that were run in this project to get the most accurate data.</p><p>Once the replications were run, the performance of the resources used at each workstation was reviewed (operators involved in the process), finding that the stations of top cushioning, quilting, closing, and packing are critical because they directly affect productivity by producing delays. The simulations show that some resources are operating above 100% of their daily capacity. For example, in the case of the top cushioning cutting operator, the utilization percentage yielded 170%. This overtime is caused by waiting time while foam rolls are provided. This utilization above 100% of daily capacity is because the daily scheduled production is not completed within the 8-hour work shift, and instead, the operator must work overtime to fulfill the schedule. The resources of the lining process are not being used efficiently; the operators are working at 22% of their capacity. The stations of quilting and closing are working below 50% of their capacity. On the other hand, the packing station uses only 52% of its capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Scenario analysis and assessment of improvement proposals</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1.">Scenario 1: Viability of one operator performing the sheet lining process</head><p>The first reviewed scenario aims to reduce waiting times at the cutting machine during the top cushioning cutting process. During the methods and times analysis, the used method was not efficient, as the operator stops the cutting machine while accommodating the padded covers in place. Based on this, another way was proposed, in which the operator performs the accommodation of the padded cover at the same time as the machine cuts the next padded cover.</p><p>This scenario was assessed by making the required changes in the simulation model. The first step of the analysis was to determine the percentage of time that operators are idle under the current configuration. Then this will be compared to the way the process operates when a single operator performs sheet lining. It should be noted that the average time an order takes in the system is measured for the effects of verifying whether the proposed changes produce any delays.</p><p>Since this scenario assessed the behavior of the lining operators (lining operator one and lining operator 2), the utilization rate of both operators is 22.4%, which implies that these operators' capacity is not being fully utilized. The causes for this situation can be the lack of supplies for the operation and an excess number of operators assigned to this task. Now we will assess the percentage of utilization if only one operator performs the sheet lining process.</p><p>This scenario showed that the behavior of the other operators is similar to the two lining operators, who are busy only 37.1% of the time, representing a 14.7% increase in the level of usage. In terms of the average time it takes to process an order, it was found that when only one operator is used, the average time remains stable, i.e., the average time of this new arrangement is 32.2 hours, which represents a difference of 0.11 hours. Therefore, the model behaves similarly to the current process. The above corroborates that lining operator 2 is not indispensable, and consequently, this operator can instead work as a material handler as suggested in the following scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2.">Scenario 2: Viability of two operators working as material handlers under current demand conditions</head><p>The second proposal involves hiring two material handlers responsible for carrying out the work in process between the work stations. The first material handler would be in charge of transporting the padded covers to the manufacturing and closing station. This first material handler also would be in charge of supplying the sidebands in the manufacturing station and transporting the drawers to the closing area. The second material handler would be in charge of carrying out the closed mattress to the packing station and transporting the finished mattresses to the storage area as they are being packed. The first scenario indicates that a single operator can perform the foam sheet lining process, which implies that the second operator can work instead as a material handler.</p><p>The assessment of this scenario will be twofold. On the one hand, we want to assess whether using these extra resources decreases the utilization of the resources at other stations. On the other hand, the idea is to evaluate the average production time. By expediting the processes, this time is expected to decrease.</p><p>After running the experiment with the number of replications required, the usage level of the operators was established, and it indicates a reduction in the use of resources. The percentual decrease in the use of operators goes from the lining operator with a 9% reduction, covers the quilting station with a decline of 10% per worker, the same behavior displayed by the closing workers. The packing operators decreased their usage by 15%, and the top cushioning cutting operator usage dropped 83% by having an operator take care of transporting top cushioning to the quilting station. It indicates that resource usage in all workstations decreased by at least 9%. Also, the average time an order takes in the system in this scenario is 28.8 hours, equivalent to an absolute reduction by 3.29 hours from the current operation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.3.">Scenario 3: Viability of a 20% increase in production</head><p>Once the benefits of having two operators work as material handlers became apparent, the third scenario will assess whether the company can continue to satisfy demand if it increases by 20%. In this third scenario, it will be assumed that daily demand has a uniform distribution with a minimum of 105 and a maximum of 260 mattresses. This scenario will be verified by hypothesis testing to assess whether the model's behavior continues to meet the average time of delivery of the current system.</p><p>: μ ≤ 33 hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> : μ <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Initially, the model was run, including the changes with ten replications. The data obtained from the replications indicated that the average time an order spends in the system is μ3=33.19 with a deviation σ3 =2.14. After having confirmed that the data are normally distributed, using the hypothesis testing formula, Z=0.28. This implies that the null hypothesis is valid and that the average time it takes to process an order in the model with the proposed improvements continues to behave in a manner that is like the current system. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents a summary of the comparison for the utilization of the resources in each scenario presented.</p><p>The above study concludes that improvements suggested to the company are viable, following their corroboration employing simulation using the Arena® software. A financial assessment of the second and third scenarios shows that the company's profits could increase by up to 6.5%, which is equivalent to an additional income of COP 574,548,047.26 compared to the company's current process, considering that the expenses involved in training and hiring are only the 1% of the extra income.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
