<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>An edge is characterized in a monochrome image by an intensity discontinuity. This may correspond to object boundaries or to a change in some physical property, such as illumination (shadows) or reflectance (surface orientation). In the case of mulltispectral (color) images, color plays a significant role in the perception of boundaries between regions as it is indicated by psychological research on the human visual system [l], <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. It follows that color information should also be considered in addition to the other physical properties in edge detection approaches for color images. However, this is implicitly not considered in color edge detection schemes where the edges are searched separately in different components of a color image (e.g. intensity, normalized red, normalized green <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>) or in a component that results as a combination of some other components (e.g. brightness <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>). More surprisingly, research in the problem of color edge detection seems to have been neglected, especially when compared to the bulk of work done in monochrome edge detection so far [5]-[SI.</p><p>The early approaches to color edge detection usually comprise extensions of the monochrome edge detectors 1. 0 color images. <ref type="bibr">Nevatia [3]</ref> has proposed the use of the Hueckel edge operator in the luminance, chrominance color space. <ref type="bibr">Robinsoin [4]</ref> has studied the application of compass gradient edge detection method to color images. The gradient operators proposed for grey-level images <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> can be extended to color images by taking the vector sum of the gradients of the individual components <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, [Ill. However, this approach may be very unsatisfactory in certain cases [Ill. Consider for example, the case of a color image where in a certain direction, the red component is constant while the green and the blue components both show step edges with the same strength but in opposite directions. Then, the vector sum of the gradients would provide a null gradient.</p><p>Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">July 11, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">revised April 1, 1994, and</ref><ref type="bibr">January 19, 1995.</ref> P.

In these approaches, color images are treated as vector fields, as has initially been suggested in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Zenzo</p><p>[ I l l , and Cumani [I31 employ vector gradient and second order derivative operators, respectively. In another approach, reported in <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, the entropy operator is used as an edge detector for monochrome as well as for color images.</p><p>A different approach to the problem of color edge detection is proposed in this paper which is based on vector order statistics [ 141. This approach is inspired by the morphological edge detectors <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> that have been proposed for the case of monochrome images. These detectors essentially operate by detecting local minima and maxima in the image function and combining them in a suitable way in order to produce a positive response for an edge pixel. Since there is no exact equivalent of the min-max scalar operators for multivariate variables, we rely on the vector ordering schemes that have been proposed in the statistics literature <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. More specifically, the R-ordering (reduced or aggregate ordering) scheme is adopted, and a class of color edge detectors is defined using linear combinations of the sorted vector samples. The minimum over the magnitudes of these linear combinations defines this class of operators. Different coefficients in the linear combinations result in different edge detectors that vary in simplicity and in efficiency. The coefficients are preset and cannot be changed at run time. It is shown by experimental and simulation results that a certain set of coefficients achieves a robust color edge detector. Moreover, our approach is shown superior to previous approaches based on comparative evaluation results using Pratt's figure of merit <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. The comparison has been made against the well known vector operators (vector gradient, second order derivative, entropy), and the vector sum of the gradients of the three color components. The final operator is also used since it presents one of the best known component-wise operators [ 181.  In what follows, a brief introduction to vector order statistics is first given in Section I1 for the self completeness of the paper. Our approach to color edge detection is described in detail in Section 111. Evaluation results as well as edge detection results obtained from real images are presented in Section IV, and our conclusions are outlined in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">VECTOR ORDER STATISTICS</head><p>Scalar order statistics have played an important role in the design of robust signal analysis techniques. This is due to the fact that any outliers will be located in the extreme ranks in the sorted data. Consequently, these outliers can be isolated and filtered out before the signal is further processed. Ordering of univariate data is well defined and has been extensively studied <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. Let the n random variables X,, i = 1,2, . . . , n, be arranged in ascending order of magnitude as Then the ith random variable X(t) is the so-called ith order statistic. The minimum X(l), maximum X(n), and median X(n/2) are among the most important order statistics, resulting in the min, max, and median filters, respectively. 10834419/96$05.00 0 1996 IEEE These concepts are, however, not straightforwardly expanded to multivariate data since there isn't any universal way of defining an ordering in multivariate data. There has been a number of ways proposed to perform multivariate data ordering that are generally classified into [ 141: marginal ordering (M-ordering), reduced or aggregate ordering (R-ordering), partial ordering (P-ordering), and conditional ordering (C-ordering).</p><p>Let X represent a p-dimensional multivariate X = [ X I , X 2 , . . . ,XplT where Xi, I = 1 , 2 , . . . . p are random variables and let X', i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n be an observation of X. Each Xt is a p-dimensional vector Xt = [ X i , XG, . . . , X i ] T .</p><p>In M-ordering the multivariate samples are ordered along each one of the p-dimensions independently. For color signals this is equivalent to the separable method where each one of the colors is processed independently. The ith marginal order statistic is the vector X'" = [Xp', Xp', . . . , Xt'] , where Xp) is the ith largest element in the rth channel. The marginal order statistic X(') may not correspond to any of the original samples X I , X2, . . . . X" as it does in one dimension.</p><p>In R-ordering, each multivariate observation X' is reduced to a scalar value d, according to a distance criterion. A metric that is often used is the generalized distance to some point x. The samples are then arranged in ascending order of magnitude of the associated metric values d,.</p><p>In P-ordering the objective is to partition the data into groups or sets of samples, such that the groups can be distinguished with respect to order, rank, or extremeness. This type of ordering can be accomplished by using the notion of convex hulls. However, the determination of the convex hull is difficult to do in more than two dimensions. Other ways to achieve P-ordering are ad hoc partitioning procedures and are thus not preferred. Another drawback associated with P-ordering is that there is no ordering within the groups and thus it is not easily expressed in analytical terms. These properties make P-ordering infeasible for implementation in digital image processing.</p><p>In C-ordering the multivariate samples are ordered conditional on one of the marginal sets of observations. This has the disadvantage in color image processing that only the information in one component (channel) is used.</p><p>From the above it is evident that R-ordering is more appropriate for color image processing than the other vector ordering methods. If we employ as a distance metric the aggregate distance of Xz to the set of vectors XI, X 2 , . . . , X", then T where I/ . 11 represents an appropriate vector norm. The arrangement of the d,s in ascending order (d(') 5 d ( 2 ) 5 . . . 5 cl(n)), associates the same ordering to the multivariate X's</p><p>In the ordered sequence X(') is the vector median of the data samples [20]. It is defined as the vector contained in the given set whose distance to all other vectors is a minimum. Moreover, vectors appearing in low ranks in the ordered sequence are vectors centrally located in the population, whereas vectors appearing in high ranks are vectors that diverge mostly from the data population. These samples are generally called "outliers." It follows that this ordering scheme gives a natural definition of the median of a population and of the outliers of a population. r  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I I 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ / / / /</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Notation and Definitions</head><p>In this work a color image is viewed as a vector field, represented by a discrete vector valued function f(x) : 2' + Z m , where Z represents the set of integers'. A notation will be used in the following concerning the image function f . For W C Z 2 , xz E W, i = 1 , 2 . . . . . n, n is the size (number of pixels) of W, f(xt) will be denoted as X" X(') will denote the ith ordered vector in the window TV according to the R-ordering method where the aggregate distance is used as a distance metric. Consequently, X(') is the vector median in the window W and X(") is the outlier in the highest rank of the ordered vectors.</p><p>Although definitions of color edges have been given in other works [3], [13] we give here a loose definition of color edges in the context of vector fields. We also want to extend the notion of ramp edges that is well understood in monochrome images to color images. It is noted that the following definitions are not intended as formal definitions that can lead to edge detection operators but rather as intuitive descriptions of the notion of color edges in order to facilitate our discussion on edge detectors. We define a color edge as any signiJcant discontinuity in the vector field representing the color image function. An abrupt change in the vector field characterizes a color step edge, whereas a gradual change characterizes a color ramp edge. These points are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Color Edge Detectors Based on Vector Order Statistics</head><p>Based on the previous discussion on vector order statistics, we define the basic color edge detector, the vector range' (VR) edge detector, as V R expresses in a quantitative way the deviation of the vector outlier in the highest rank from the vector median in W . Consequently, in a uniform area, where all vectors will be close to each other, the output of V R will be small. However, its response on an edge will be large since X(") will be selected among the vectors from the one side of the edge (the smaller side, when we assume that W is divided by the edge into two unequal sides) while X(') will be selected among the vectors from the other side of the edge (the larger side). By thresholding the output of V R the actual edges can be obtained. The response of V R to the two images (vector fields) of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">23</ref>. As can be verified from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, V R introduces no bias in the case of a color step edge since it responds equally to both sides of the edge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(a)</ref>), but it responds with a 3-pixel wide edge in the case of an ideal color ramp edge. V R is also sensitive to noise, especially to noise modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution (e.g. double-exponential) which, according to [20]1, 161, is termed as heavy-tailed noise. Similarly, noise modeled with a short-tailed distribution (e.g. gaussian) is termed as short-tailed noise.</p><p>VR will respond with n pixels (the pixels that belong to W ) to a single noisy pixel in the center of W . This drawback leads us to consider dispersion measures which are known as more robust estimates in the presence of noise <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. A class of operators can be defined as a linear combination of the ordered vectors; V R is a special case of this class. This class of operators expresses a measure of the dispersion of the ordered vectors, and hence the name vector dispersion edge detectors (V D E D ) :</p><p>where at are proper coefficients (weights). V R is obtained from V D E D for a , = 1, a1 = -1, and a , = 0, i = 2 , . . . , n -1. Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) can be further generalized by considering k sets of coefficients at and combining the resulting vector magnitudes in a suitable way. The combination that is proposed employs a minimum operator which attenuates the effect of noise. Such a minimum operator has also been employed in [16] in order to derive a detector insensitive to noise impulses. According to the above, the general class of color edge detectors based on vector order statistics is defined as (6), shown at the bottom of the page, where h ! f V D E D stands for minimum V D E D . Specific color edge detectors can be obtained from M V D E D by selecting sets of coefficients a t 3 . Since a strict mathematical approach to this seems very difficult, we select sets of aC3 s that satisfy the requirements of (a) noise insensitivity, and (b) proper response to ramp edges.</p><p>The resulting edge detectors, that conform to the above requirements, are considered next. Two cases are presented that result in operators with (a) immunity to heavy-tailed noise, and (b) immunity to short-tailed noise and improved performance in the presence of ramp edges. An operator that combines these characteristics is finally introduced. For the sake of brevity, the coefficients aZI will implicitly be considered as being equal to zero for all the pairs i , j for which they are not defined.</p><p>Case I : a,, = a,-1,p</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">-. . . -a,-k+l,k = 1, = -1, j = 1 , 2 , . . . , k , k &lt; n.</formula><p>As explained previously, VR is sensitive to noise (especially to heavy-tailed noise) since the vectors placed in the highest ranks of the ordered data will essentially correspond to noisy samples and consequently VR will erroneously respond in the presence of noise. This problem can be alleviated by employing the magnitudes of the differences of the k highest vectors from X(') and obtain an edge detector that is insensitive to heavytailed noise (e.g. impulsive or exponential). In terms of (6) this can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">- - j = 1 , 2 ,..., k , k &lt; n (7)</formula><p>where MVR stands for minimum VR. The choice of k depends on n, the size of W . For a 3 x 3 window, for example, k 5 3 and for a 5 x 5, k 5 10. Unfortunately, there is no general formula to obtain k and its value should be subjectively estimated. However, this is not a difficult task since k can be interpreted as the number of pixels that belong to the smaller side of an edge, when W is centered on an edge pixel. Moreover, its value is not crucial in the overall performance of MVR. The response of M V R to ideal step and ramp color edges is exactly the same as the response of V R .</p><p>However, it exhibits improved noise immunity. It will not respond to up to k -1 noisy pixels in W .</p><p>A final comment on MVR concerns the use of the min function.</p><p>We note that this can not be simply replaced by taking the magnitude of the vector difference between X("-"') (the "smallest" among the X("-3+1), j = 1 , 2 , . . . , k , vectors) and X(') since it will yield in general different results. In other words, the magnitudes of vector differences in a sorted vector data set, do not necessarily follow the order of the sorted vectors. This is exemplified by a simple example concerning the set of 2 -D vectors S, = {(5,4), (4,5), (4,7), (4,2), (3.4)). Sorting S, will result in the orderedsets, = {(4,5),(5,4),(3,4),(4,2),(4,7)}.Itisnotedthat (4,7) has been placed in the highest rank in the sorted data set and (4,2) has been placed in the second highest rank. The distance, however, of (4,2) to the vector median (4,5) is larger than the distance of (4,7) to (4,5) for both L1 and Lp metrics. The response of VD to the two images of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Its behavior is exactly the same with the behavior of T' -R and MVR in the case of the color step edge. However, it has improved performance in the case of a color ramp edge since it assigns a higher value (Cl) to the true edge pixel than the value (C,) assigned to the neighboring pixels (the fact that C1 &gt; C, can be very easily proved by geometrical considerations). Consequently, by thresholding the output of VD with a proper threshold value, the ramp edges can be extracted. For ideal ramp edges of larger spatial extent than the detectors window, more than one central pixels will be given a large value. However, by enlarging the window size the central (true edge) pixel will again be given a higher value than its neighbors and it can be detected by thresholding.</p><p>The value of the parameter I used in the computation of 1 -D can not be formally defined as it is the case for the parameter k employed in the computation of MVR. However, a duality exists between these two parameters; Z expresses the number of pixels that belong to the larger side of an edge when T V is centered on an edge pixel. Therefore, proper values for the parameter 1 can be subjectively estimated for various sizes of W .</p><p>is the vector a-trimmed mean ( V a T M ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[21]</ref>, which is a robust signal estimate in color images when the noise is modeled as shorttailed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[22]</ref>. It is, therefore, expected that TrD will have improved performance in the presence of short-tailed noise due to the smoothing performed.</p><p>Case3: anl = a,-1,2 = . . . = a n -k + l , k = 1. ai3 = +. i = 1 , 2 . . . . , I , .j = 1 , 2 , . . . , k , Z,k &lt; n. The two operators introduced previously ( M V R , VD) have some desirable properties that are different in each case. M V R is insensitive in the presence of heavytailed noise. VD responds properly to color ramp edges and has improved performance in the presence of short-tailed noise. We wish to combine these two operators in order to exploit the properties of both. This can be achieved by the set of coefficients a Z J outlined above. The resulting edge detector (minimum vector dispersion - M V D ) is given as</p><p>The second term in the vector difference in (8) Cl=, x(i)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( 7) j = l , 2 ,..., k , k , I &lt; n (9)</formula><p>M V D inherits the properties of its ancestors. It is a bias free operator for color step edges whereas it produces a larger response for the true edge of a color ramp edge. Its response to the images of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is exactly the same as the response of V D (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Moreover, it has improved noise performance since it is robust in the presence of heavy-tailed noise (due to the minimum operation) and short-tailed noise (due to the averaging operation). The noise performance of MVD is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> for the cases of gaussian (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(c</ref>)) and double-exponential (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(e)) noise. The response of M V D , shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(d</ref>) and (f), respectively, is much larger at the true edge which is, therefore, easily detected by thresholding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Statistical Considerations</head><p>A statistical analysis of M V D is attempted here in order to derive the error probability of the edge detector. The analysis is confined to the case of multivariate normal distributions only, since these are the only distributions for which analytical results concerning the distribution functions have been derived in the statistics literature. We consider an ideal edge model with the sample vectors X, on the one side of the edge as instances of a random variable X which follows a multivariate normal distribution N , ( p z , I,). Similarly, the sample vectors Y , on the other side are instances of the random variable Y which is N,(pVr I m ) . Then, the error probability is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">-1 0 1 2 3 t'</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. PE versus t' (see text for explanation).</p><p>where P,, P, denote the prior probabilities of "edge" and "no edge," respectively, and I'M, PF are the probabilities of missing an edge and false edge alarm, respectively. A detailed analysis of (IO) is carried out in the Appendix. Based on the results presented there, a plot of PE is drawin which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The parameter p shown on the plot expresses the number of sample distances (i.e. ordered vectors) and is equal to IC [see ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)]. It is, therefore, related to the window size n. Froin ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), and Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> we can conclude that PE is decreased with respect top. Since p increases with the window size n, it is concluded that the probability of error PE decreases with respect to 7 ~. However, n can not be drastically increased since it is well known that a large window has a negative effect in accurate edge localization. Besides, n should be kept reasonably small due to computational requirements as we will see in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Computational Considerations</head><p>Computationally the vector ordering task is a 0(n2) operation since $n(n -I) vector distances have to be computed. The ordering itself may be performed by a fast sorting algorithim (e.g. quicksort) with a O(n1ogn) complexity. Therefore, the whole task of vector ordering is dominated by the O ( n 2 ) term which determines its complexity. For the case, however, of color im,age processing, a fast algorithm has been proposed for the computation of the vector distances <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. This algorithm is based on the principle that as the window W (of size n ) moves in the image plane, only m (&lt; n ) new pixels are considered each time whose distances have to be computed. The distances of the rest n -rn pixels are simply updated. This algorithm results in a 0 n3" complexity for the computation of the vector distances in the case of square windows (m = 6). The trade-off is the increased programming complexity in the computation of the distances.</p><p>The V a T M can be computed only once since it does not depend on the index j [( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)]. Its computation is a O ( l ) operation, 1 &lt; n.</p><p>The computation of the magnitudes of the IC vector differences ( / / X("-3f1) -V a T M is a O ( k ) operatiton, k &lt; n. This operation can be performed simultaneously with the minimization operation. In summary, the computational complexity of ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is O ( n 2 ) if all the vector distances in W7 are computed, which can be reduced to O(n3") if the fast algorithm is employed. For small IL, which is the case in edge detection, even the O ( n 2 ) complexity is not very expensive. Furthermore, if the L1 norm is adopted only integer operations are involved, whereas for the La norm, square root operations have to be employed. However, the siquare roots can be avoided, which is equivalent to computing the M V D squared. 0 11)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>Quantitative evaluation of the performance of edge detectors is complicated since different evaluation criteria are employed by the designers which lead to different performance figures. Moreover, quantitative evaluation is in many cases not performed and only qualitative results are presented which are very difficult to be used in assessing the performance of edge detectors. The quantitative performance measures can be grouped into two types, probabilistic measures and distance measures. The first type is based upon the statistics of false edge detection and false edge rejection. The second type is based upon edge deviation or error distance which is the minimum distance between the detected and the truth edge. A distance measure that is often used in edge detector's evaluations is Pratt's figure of merit (FOM) <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. It is defined as where 10, I I are the number of detected and number of ideal edge points respectively, a (&gt; 0) is a calibration constant, and d, is the separation distance of the ith detected edge point normal to a line of ideal edge points <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. In all cases 0 &lt; F O M 5 1; for a p e ~e c t match between the detected and the ideal edges F O M = 1, whereas as the detected edges deviate more and more from the ideal ones F O M goes to zero. F O h l has been adopted in this work due to its advantage over the probabilistic measures that it renders a more realistic appraisal of the detected edges <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. If we consider, for example, the case where all the edges are 1-pixel shifted from the ground truth, a probabilistic measure would give a very poor rating but F O M still gives a performance measure very close to unity (0.9). Moreover, F O M has been used by many authors in the evaluation of edge detectors [7], <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[25]</ref>. The scaling constant a = 1/9 proposed by Abdou and Pratt has been adopted in our simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Performance Evaluation</head><p>An artificial image has been created and used as a benchmark for assessing the performance of the vector order statistics operators and for comparison purposes. It is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> along with its red, green and blue components. This image has been intentionally created in order to meet a number of requirements: (a) it contains vertical, horizontal and diagonal edges, (b) there are edges where all three color components, or two color components, or only one color component change, (c) black (all color components are zero), white (all color components are equal to the maximum value, 255) and grey (all color components have the same value) areas are present on the image, and (d) isoluminant (areas with identical luminance) and nonisoluminant areas are present on the image.</p><p>A number of edge detection experiments have been conducted using various noise distributions at various noise levels to contaminate the test image. In each case, F O M has been measured and used as the performance criterion. The ground truth (real edges) that is needed for the computation of F O M , is trivially obtained for the noise free (original) artificial image (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) with the application of any edge detector. Three noise types were used in the experiments: gaussian, double-exponential and impulsive. For each noise type two sets of experiments have been performed. In the first set, the noise process in each channel has been considered as an independent process. In the second set, the noise process has been considered as a correlated process since there is some indication that this type of correlation may exist in real color images.</p><p>The performance measures of the color edge detectors based on vector order statistics are shown graphically in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. A number of Artificial image used for testing and comparison purposes (a) image, conclusions can be drawn from the graphs of Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> which are in accordance with the structure of the edge detectors:</p><p>The performance of M V D is superior compared to the other operators for all types of noise. This is quite as expected since M V D has actually been assembled using the desirable properties of the other operators.</p><p>V R is sensitive to noise and its performance is largely deteriorated as noise increases. * M V R and TiD have good performances for heavy-tailed and short-tailed noise, respectively. From the plots of Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> we also conclude that the performance deterioration of the vector order statistics edge detectors is "smooth" as noise increases. Only for the case of impulsive noise we observe a more "precipitous" performance degradation in the range 6 8 dB, which, for the test image of Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, corresponds to 8-10% of noise corruption. This noise level is sufficiently high to justify the performance degradation, especially for the case of color images where the contribution of the three channels causes one in every three or four pixels to be corrupted.</p><p>In the experiments described above the Llnorm has been used. The reason for this is that very similar results have been obtained for both the L I and the Lz norms, but L1 is cheaper to compute. The values used for the parameters of the operators were: 5 x 5 window, IC = 8, I = 12. It should be noted here that these values have been experimentally obtained and, more importantly, they are not critical in the overall performance. Practically, their performance has been left unchanged for 7 &lt;: k 5 10 and 10 5 1 5 15. Regarding the window size, even a 3 x 3 window has given very good results for low noise levels. However, for higher noise levels the 5 x 5 window performs better since it involves more pixels in the edge detection process.</p><p>For comparison purposes, the same test image and the same evaluation procedure have been used. In the experiments conducted M V D has been compared against four other color edge detectors: the vector gradient operator [ 1 11, the second-order derivative operator F O M plots for the color edge detectors based on vector order <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, the entropy operator [lo], and the vector sum of the gradients of the three color components. The last operator has been selected among the operators that result from combining component-wise edge detectors since it produces results that are generally better <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The performance measures obtained are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>. As can be verified from this figure, all the operators have good performance for low noise levels, although M V D performs slightly better. However, as the S N R decreases, the superiority of the proposed M V D becomes clear for all noise types. The performance of the vector gradient operator and the second-order derivative operator is close enough to the performance of M V D for gaussian noise but is inferior for double-exponential and impulsive noise. The other two operators have lower performance measures. Especially the performance of the entropy operator is largely degraded as noise increases.</p><p>In order to impart an intuitive feel of the behavior of M V D and the other four color edge detectors, and complement the quantitative results presented in Figs. 7  <ref type="table"></ref>and<ref type="table">8</ref> exhibit a degree of robustness but the entropy operator (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9(e)</ref>) is very noise sensitive. The vector sum of gradients operator (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9(f)</ref>) performs comparably to the vector gradient operator (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9(c</ref>)); it is interesting to note, however, that it fails to detect two vertical edges (red -cyan edge, yellowpink edge) since the image gradients change in opposite directions in these areas.  VG), second-order derivative (SOD), entropy ( E N ) , vector sum of gradients (VSG).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Application to Real Images</head><p>Since the topic is image processing, the subjective evaluation constitutes a very important criterion as of the performance of any operator. Consequently, we have applied the vector order statistics based operators to real color images. Many different kinds of images have been utilized ranging from human faces to detailed outdoor scenes. In all cases, the results obtained were in good agreement with our subjective criteria for color edges. The edge detection results for an "airplane" image are presented here. This image has been selected because of the difficulty associated with the edge detection task due to the low contrast edges. The original color image is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10(a</ref>) and the M V D results are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10(b)</ref>.</p><p>The results of the color edge detectors used for comparison are also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">lO(c</ref>)-(0, respectively. A visual evaluation gives the impression that the M V D and the vector giradient perform comparably, but still M V D produces thinner edges and is less sensitive to small texture variations. This can be ascribed to the averaging operation which essentially smooths out small variations whereas the gradient-based operators are sensitive even to small changes. The second-order derivative operator is very sensitive to texture variations and the edges produced give the impression of a blurred original image. The reason for this is that a regularizing filter has to be applied before the computation of the derivatives. As suggested in [13], the gaussian filter is used; a standard deviation value (T = 3.5 has been selected through experimentation. This large value of (T is needed for the computation of the secondorder derivatives and is responsible for the blurring produced. The entropy operator is totally insensitive to texture variations but on the other hand it leaves undetected many edges that correspond to fine image details. The results of the vector sum of the gradients operator resemble the results of the vector gradient operator, but are generally inferior. Moreover, this operator can not detect some simple edges when the gradients of the image components change in the opposite direction (see the back wing for example).</p><p>The noise behavior of the color edge detectors is illustrated in As can be verified the performance of the M V D is superior to the vector gradient. The results of the other three operators (second-order derivative, entropy and vector sum gradient) are not shown since they are inferior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The problem of color edge detection has been studied using vector order statistics in this paper. A class of color edge detectors has been proposed and efficient operators from this class have been derived by proper choice of the parameters. The experimental results presented demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for noiseless as well as for noise contaminated images. The robustness of the proposed Vector order statistics are gaining importance in color image processing <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[22]</ref> since they offer a means of ordering multivariate samples. Until now, however, they have been used only in image filtering tasks by exploiting their property of placing the central vectors in the lower ranks of the sorted data. In this work. vector order statistics have been employed for the first time for a different task, namely color edge detection. Accurate detection of the edges is of primary importance for the later steps in an image analysis system. It has been shown that the proposed approach achieves this goal and consequently it may be very useful in color image analysis.</p></div>
