<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>De novo protein design for catalysis of any desired chemical reaction is a long standing goal in protein engineering, due to the broad spectrum of technological, scientific and medical applications. Currently, mapping protein sequence to protein function is, however, neither computationionally nor experimentally tangible 1,2 . Here we developed ProteinGAN, a specialised variant of the generative adversarial network 3 that is able to 'learn' natural protein sequence diversity and enables the generation of functional protein sequences. ProteinGAN learns the evolutionary relationships of protein sequences directly from the complex multidimensional amino acid sequence space and creates new, highly diverse sequence variants with natural-like physical properties. Using malate dehydrogenase as a template enzyme, we show that 24% of the ProteinGAN-generated and experimentally tested sequences are soluble and display wild-type level catalytic activity in the tested conditions in vitro , even in highly mutated (&gt;100 mutations) sequences.</p><p>ProteinGAN therefore demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to rapidly generate highly diverse novel functional proteins within the allowed biological constraints of the sequence space.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MANUSCRIPT</head><p>A protein's three-dimensional structure, physicochemical properties and molecular function are defined by its amino acid sequence. From the 20 commonly occurring proteinogenic amino acids, a small sized protein comprising 100 amino acids can be made in 10 130 unique ways. In this vast multidimensional space -often referred to as the protein fitness landscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> -as little as 1 in 10 77 sequences are estimated to fold into the defined three-dimensional structures to carry out specific functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . This imposes a great burden on experimental approaches aiming to design novel protein sequences, such as random mutagenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and recombination of naturally occurring homologous proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , as up to 70% of random amino acid substitutions typically result in a decline of protein activity and 50% are deleterious to protein function <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> . On the other hand, Artificial intelligence (AI) is not limited by the amount of sequence variations it can process <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and, instead of depending on a blind search, is based on an inference-based process -it infers protein properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> directly from training examples.</p><p>Recent AI approaches have also demonstrated great potential in capturing both the structural and evolutionary information found in natural protein sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Nevertheless, the majority of existing machine learning models in biology are discriminative <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , i.e. the model is trained using readily available data, to predict the properties of a given protein sequence. A generative modeling approach, in contrast, could generate new sequence samples from the learned portion of functional protein sequence space, providing direct access to unexplored sequence diversity within functional protein structures, without the need to test a large number of non-functional protein sequence variants. Indeed, breakthrough generative learning strategies, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> can learn multidimensional distributions in disparate scientific domains to generate photorealistic images <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , hand-written text <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , music <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and even DNA sequences with biological properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Hence, in the present study we develop and test ProteinGAN (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) to learn and sample the protein sequence space for de novo generation of functional enzymes.</p><p>ProteinGAN is a generative model architecturally tailored specifically to learn patterns in long biological sequences (Methods, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). A customized temporal convolutional network <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> enabled the network to simultaneously analyze local and global sequence fragments, and thus to capture the meaningful sequence motifs and long-distance relationships that are critical for correct protein structural assemble. Additionally, we introduced a self-attention layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> to help ProteinGAN focus on functionally important areas across the entire length of the sequences, such as catalytic residues (Methods, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The final architecture of the network comprised 45 layers with over 60 million trainable parameters.</p><p>A family of bacterial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) enzymes (EC 1.1.1.37) was used to train the neural network. MDH is a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme catalyzing the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate using NAD + as a cofactor (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). We chose MDH based on the following criteria: (i) it has a large number of diverse sequences (a total of 16 706 unique sequences were used for training), which were on average 319 ± 18.2 (sd) amino acids long with pairwise sequence identities as low a s 10%; (ii) it is a complex enzyme that must bind both its substrate and the NAD + cofactor for catalysis and (iii) its activity can be readily monitored in vitro . During model training, we assessed the quality of the sequences generated by ProteinGAN at every 1200 learning steps. In each assessment, 64 sequences were generated and their identities to natural sequences in the training and validation datasets were computed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). After 2.5M learning steps, at which training was terminated (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure">3, 4</ref>), the mean sequence identities between the generated and natural sequence sets had reached a plateau (median sequence identity to the closest natural sequences was 61.3%). Following the initial quality assessment, 20 000 of the generated sequences were used to further evaluate the ProteinGAN performance. First, we evaluated ProteinGAN's ability to capture evolutionary sequence properties, i.e. the positional amino acid variation in generated and natural sequences. Shannon entropies were computed for each position in multiple sequence alignments of the generated and natural MDH sequences (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). The positional variability in generated sequences was highly similar to that in natural sequences, with peaks (high entropy) and valleys (low entropy) appearing at similar positions in the sequence alignment. Indeed, we observed a high correlation (Pearson's r = 0.89, p -value &lt; 1e-16) between the entropy values of generated and natural sequences. At conserved positions the generated sequences preserved key substrate-binding and catalytic residues (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>). Further comparative analysis of generated and natural sequences showed that even in highly variable sequence regions, the frequencies of individual amino acids were perfectly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.96, p -value &lt; 1e-16, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Moreover, for each individual sequence, ProteinGAN inferred the specific physicochemical amino acid signatures present in this enzyme class. For instance, despite high sequence diversity among generated sequences, the fractions of hydrophobic, aromatic, charged and cysteine-containing residues were the same (Wilcoxon rank sum test p -value &gt; 0.05) as in natural ones. Apart from the differences in hydrophilic and polar uncharged residues ( p -value = 7e-5 and 1e-28, respectively), the network had learned the overall amino acid composition corresponding to both the evolutionary and physicochemical constraints (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, d; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">6, 7</ref>).</p><p>In proteins, amino acid pairs that are remote on the primary sequence are often spatially close and interact in the 3D structure, ensuring the appropriate protein stability and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . We therefore assessed whether ProteinGAN was able to learn such local and global amino acid relationships by looking for pairwise amino acid relationships across the full length of the MDH sequences. To investigate local pairwise relationships we calculated the amino acid association measures for natural and generated sequences using the minimal proximity function Z m ( Santoni et al. 2016 ). The function Z m (A,B) counts, for each pairwise combination of the 20 amino acids, the average distance between amino acid A to the next amino acid B occuring in the sequence. The calculated distances can be expressed as a matrix of all pairwise combinations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>). The matrices for the natural and generated sequences were 88% similar, showing that the amino acid positional order had been learned by ProteinGAN, capturing the local amino acid relationships existing in natural sequences. One of the main differences between the two sequence sets was in tryptophan (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>, W column), likely resulting from the fact that 22% of the natural MDH sequences used did not have tryptophan. To investigate the global amino acid relationships, we calculated the pairwise amino acid frequency distributions for all combinations of position pairs in all sequences in multiple sequence alignments. These frequency distributions were then used to calculate correlations between the training and generated sequences. Overall, we found strong correlations between the natural and generated sequences (averaged Pearson's r = 0.95, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>), which demonstrated that the pairwise relationships were highly similar in both sets of sequences. To expand on this, we inspected whether the generated MDH sequences possessed the two main Pfam ( Finn et al. 2014 ) domains "Ldh_1_N" and "Ldh_1_C" that were identified ( E -value &lt; 1e-10) in the natural MDH sequences. Indeed, we found that 98% of the generated sequences contained both signatures, with the rest containing one of the two domains. Collectively, our results show that ProteinGAN-generated sequences are of high quality and closely mimic natural MDH proteins, both in terms of amino acid distributions at individual sites, as well as in terms of local and long-distance relationships between pairs of amino acids present throughout the primary sequence of the MDH family.</p><p>We then explored whether ProteinGAN was able to generalize the entire protein family beyond the training dataset, i.e. to generate novel sequence diversity. Visualization of the sequence diversity of generated and natural sequences using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> showed that majority of natural MDH sequences grouped into large clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), as they were highly similar (median pairwise identity 92%, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). In contrast, the generated sequences grouped into smaller clusters interpolating between the natural sequence clusters and resembled a learned manifold of the MDH sequence space (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). To assess whether the diversity in generated sequences would contain novel and functionally relevant biological properties, we performed a search of CATH <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> sequence models corresponding to all known 3D structural protein domains (Methods). We first evaluated whether the network generated new structural domain diversity over the training period (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). While the number of identified structural domains plateaued at the early stage of training (after approx. 0.2M steps), corresponding to 79% of all identified domains, additional structural CATH domains were discovered throughout the entire training process. In total, 119 novel structural sequence motifs were identified ( E -value &lt; 1e-6) in the generated sequences that do not exist in the training MDH dataset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> inset), demonstrating the network's ability to generate novel biologically relevant sequences. We next evaluated whether the generated structural domain diversity was due to chance. To test this, as a control, we randomly introduced amino acid substitutions into the natural MDH sequences, whilst preserving natural amino acid frequency distribution and the rate of mutations to mimic the natural sequence variability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> inset, Methods). The total structural domain diversity was reduced by 38.9% in mutated natural sequences, of which 97.4% were present in natural sequences, demonstrating that random mutations did not produce biologically relevant sequence diversity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> inset, Fisher's exact test p -value &lt; 8.2e-16). Using clustering analysis based on sequence similarity we observed that on average over 95% of the generated sequences were not more than 10% similar to each other (90% sequence identity within the cluster, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>), in contrast to only 17% of the natural sequences at the same sequence identity level. This shows that the generated sequences expanded the currently known sequence space of the MDH family up to 4-fold (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>   method 1 (Methods). e) Catalytic activity confirmed using LC-MS/MS operating in selected reaction monitoring mode for enzymes expressed using protein expression method 1 (Methods). f) Oxaloacetate to malate conversion yields are comparable to natural MDH enzymes as determined using mass spectrometry.</p><p>Finally, considering that random amino acid substitutions typically result in a decline or even complete loss of protein activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> , we experimentally tested whether the ProteinGAN-generated MDH sequences were catalytically active in vitro . We selected 60 representative generated sequences within a range of 45% to 98% pairwise sequence identity to natural MDH and with 7 to 157 amino acid substitutions compared to their closest MDH neighbour (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), of which 55 were successfully synthesized and cloned into an expression vector. Production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and purification using affinity chromatography yielded 11 protein variants (Method 1) that could be purified from the cell lysate soluble fraction (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>). With the aim to identify additional soluble proteins, we repeated the experiment (Method 2) under growth conditions favouring protein folding and solubility using ArcticExpress E.coli strain, expanding the number of purified soluble proteins to a total of 19 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, 35% of all synthesized protein variants). This is comparable to other systematic studies, which typically obtain soluble protein for 20% to 40% of all tested constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> . The purified proteins were assessed for MDH activity (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) by monitoring NADH consumption using a spectrophotometer. 13 of the 19 soluble enzymes, including a variant with 106 amino acid substitutions (66% identity to the closest existing enzyme, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>), showed MDH catalytic activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13, 14</ref>). Furthermore, for the subset of 8 purified enzymes for which the protein amount could be accurately quantified the generated MDH proteins displayed similar reaction rates as wild-type enzymes (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>). These enzymes were also confirmed, by LC-MS/MS, to convert oxaloacetate to malate with reaction yields comparable to commercial MDH enzyme controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e, f</ref>).</p><p>In conclusion, here we present a generative adversarial network, ProteinGAN, that successfully captures the natural properties of proteins and enables discovery of novel functional sequences. In vitro experiments confirm that a large portion (24%) of the generated enzymes are soluble and many display catalytic activities comparable to -or surpassing that of -natural enzymes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>,e,f Supplementary Figure 11,13). The generated functional enzymes contain up to 106 mutations compared to the closest natural malate dehydrogenase (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>), while retaining functionally relevant sequence motifs and the correct position-specific amino acid composition that preserves long-range amino acid interactions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Since ProteinGAN enables large leaps to unexplored sections of the functional sequence space (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), it opens up the biochemical exploration of the highly diverse enzymes populating this space. Such enzymes may have catalytic properties that differ significantly from those found in natural enzymes, as they have not evolved with the constraint to carry out specific functions in living organisms as natural enzymes have. Navigating the fitness landscape to find even one such enzyme using current methods, including random mutagenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and recombination of homologous proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , would be highly laborious or not even feasible. Due to the exponential decline in protein fitness with the number of random mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> or the number of parent molecules that are used to generate the recombination libraries <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , current methods are fundamentally limited in the sequence space that can be explored by their use. The expanded functional sequence diversity provided by ProteinGAN (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b,c</ref>) may also provide suitable, non-natural, starting points for protein engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , with great potential for applications in biocatalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . We speculate that further development of the ProteinGAN framework will enable even greater leaps in sequence space and may also make the method applicable to smaller enzyme families. Future work should explore whether ProteinGAN can be trained on entire protein families where, despite sharing sequence similarity, its members perform distinct functions. generated data was constantly evaluated. Without halting the training process, every 1200 steps generated sequences were automatically aligned with the training and validation datasets using BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . Throughout the training, BLOSUM45, E -value and identity scores as well as standard deviation of the discriminator layer were calculated and monitored (Supplementary Figure 3, 18, 19, 20). ProteinGAN was trained for 2.5 M steps with a batch size of 64 (one step consisted of 64 sequences). The training took 210 hours (~9 days) on NVIDIA Tesla P100 (16 GB).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental validation of generated enzymes</head><p>The sequences generated by ProteinGAN were synthesized, cloned into the pET21a expression vector and sequence-verified by Twist Bioscience. In addition to the enzyme sequence a C-terminal linker and four histidines (AAALEHHHH) were added, resulting in a deca-His-tag in the final construct (which includes six histidines derived from the expression vector), to enable downstream affinity purification. Method 1: The constructs were transformed into the BL21(DE3) E. coli expression strain. From the resulting transformation mixture 15 µl was used to inoculate 500 µl LB broth supplemented with 100 µg/ml carbenicillin. Cells were grown overnight at 32°C in a 96 deep well plate with 700 rpm orbital shaking. Protein expression was achieved by diluting the overnight cultures 1:30 into 1 ml autoinduction TB including trace elements (Formedium, UK) supplemented with 100 µg/ml carbenicillin and grown for 4 h at 37°C, followed by overnight growth at 18°C and 700 rpm shaking. Cells were collected by centrifugation and the cell pellets frozen at -80°C overnight. To purify the recombinant proteins, cells were thawed, resuspended in 200 µl lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 U/ml DNaseI, 2 mM MgCl 2 ), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To improve lysis triton-X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.125% (v/v), and the cells were frozen at -80°C for 30 min. After thawing in a room temperature water bath, the lysates were spun down for 10 min at 3000 x g to remove cell debris, and the supernatants were transferred to a new 96-well plate with 50 µl Talon resin in each well (Takara Bio, Japan). Unspecific binding of proteins to the resin was reduced by adding imidazole to a final concentration of 10 mM in each well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 400 rpm shaking, after which the lysates with the beads were transferred to a 96-well filter plate (Thermo Scientific, USA, Nunc 96-well filter plates), placed over a 96-well collection plate, and centrifuged for 1 min at 500 x g in a swing-out centrifuge. The resin was washed three times with 200 µl wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 40 mM imidazole), and the proteins were eluted from the resin in two 50 µl fractions using elution buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 250 mM imidazole). The two eluate fractions were combined and transferred to a 96-well desalting plate (Thermo Scientific, USA, Zeba Spin Desalting Plate, 7K MWCO) pre-equilibrated with sample buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP). The plate was spun down 1000 x g for 1 min, and collected proteins were analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. The soluble proteins were carried on for further characterisation.</p><p>To test for malate dehydrogenase activity, an aliquot of purified protein was added to a reaction mixture containing 0.15 mM NADH, 0.2 mM oxaloacetic acid and 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). The final reaction volume was 100 µl and the reaction was carried out at room temperature in a UV-transparent 96-well half-area plate (UV-Star Microplate, Greiner, Austria). Activity was measured in triplicates by following NADH oxidation to NAD+, with absorbance reading at 340 nm performed every 30 sec for 15 min in a BMG Labtech SPECTROstar Nano spectrophotometer. Un-specific oxidation of NADH was monitored in no-substrate controls, and these values were subtracted from the other samples. Conversion from absorption values to NADH concentration was carried out using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mM. For calculation of kinetic parameters, 10 nM of each protein was assayed with a range of oxaloacetate concentrations.</p><p>LC-MS/MS quantification was performed for selected active enzymes. The activity assay was performed as outlined above, in triplicates, with protein concentrations ranging between 10 and 250 nM. Reactions were terminated after 45 min by diluting the assay mixtures in water to 1 µg/ml starting concentration of oxaloacetate. For chromatographic separation a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 50 mm × 2.1 mm × 1.8 µm (Agilent) with an Nexera series HPLC (Shimadzu) was used. Mobile phase A was composed of H20 (MiliQ HPLC grade) with 0.1% Formic acid (Sigma); mobile phase B was Methanol (Sigma) with 0.1% Formic acid (Sigma). The oven temperature was 40°C. The chromatographic gradient was set to consecutively increase from 0% to 100%, hold, decrease from 100% to 0% and hold, in 60 sec, 30 sec, 30 sec and 30 sec, respectively. The autosampler temperature was 15°C and the injection volume was 0.5 µL with full loop injection. For MS quantification a QTRAP® 6500 System (Sciex) was used, operating in negative mode with Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) parameters optimized for Malic acid based on published parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> . Electrospray ionization parameters were optimized for 0.8mL/min flow rate, and were as follows: electrospray voltage of -4500 V, temperature of 500 °C, curtain gas of 40, CAD gas set to Medium, and gas 1 and 2 of 50 and 50 psi, respectively. The instrument was mass calibrated with a mixture of polypropylene glycol (PPG) standards. The software Analyst 1.7 (Sciex) and MultiQuant 3 (Sciex) was used for analysis and quantitation of results, respectively. Additionally (Method 2), to obtain additional soluble proteins, MDH constructs were transformed into ArcticExpress competent cells (Agilent technologies, USA). The transformants were inoculated into 500 µL of LB media with 15 µg/mL of Gentamicin and 50 µg/mL of Ampicillin and grown overnight at 30°C in a Thermomixer Comfort Eppendorf thermomixer (Eppendorf, Germany). 250 µL of overnight culture were transferred to 10 mL (dilution 1:40) of semi-synthetic media (1 % Tryptone, 0.5% Yeast extract, 0.268 % (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.15% NH 4 Cl, 0.6 % KH 2 PO 4 , 0.4% K 2 HPO 4 , 1% Glycerol, pH 7.0) supplemented with 15 µg/mL of Gentamicin and 50 µg/mL of Ampicillin. Cells were cultivated at 37°C for 2 hours, until OD 600 reached 0.6-0.8, then the media were enriched with 0.5 M of saccharose. Induction was carried out at 12°C with 0.5 mM IPTG overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 x g 10 min at 4°C), resuspended in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and then sonicated on ice in 2.0 mL tubes at 30% amplitude for 5 min of total ON time (30 s on/30 s off) by using the Bandelin SonoPuls HD 2070 homogeniser (BANDELIN, Germany).</p><p>To remove cell debris, the lysates were centrifuged at 16 000 x g, 4°C. The soluble recombinant MDH mutants were purified by using HisPur™ Ni-NTA Spin columns (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). The columns with loaded supernatants were washed with Wash buffer (0.1 M Potassium phosphate buffer, pH7.4, NaCl 250 mM and 40 mM imidazole). Proteins were eluted with Elution buffer (0.1 M Potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, NaCl 250 mM and 300 mM). The eluted fractions were dialysed against 0.1M Potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The concentration of the proteins was determined using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermofisher Scientific, USA). The aliquots of total lysate, soluble lysate fraction and purified protein were loaded onto SDS PAGE 15%.</p><p>The malate dehydrogenase activity was measured at 25°C in 96-well flat bottom UV transparent plate (UV-Star Microplate) (Greiner Bio-One, Austria). The reaction mixture (final volume 200 µL) contained an aliquot of purified protein, freshly prepared 0.15 mM NADH and 0.2 mM oxaloacetic acid, and 0.1 M Potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The absorbance reading was done at 340 nm every 5 seconds for 3 minutes in a BioTek PowerWave XS microplate reader (Biotek, USA). For NADH at 340 nm 6.22 mM cm -1 extinction coefficient (εM) was used. The path length (l) in the microplate was calculated according A=c x εM x l.</p></div>

As opposed to natural sequences, generated sequences formed disparate small clusters indicating their diverse nature. b) CATH domain diversity generated throughout evolution of ProteinGAN. At every 1200 learning steps, 64 sequences were sampled and searched for representative CATH domains (E-value &lt;1e-6). Inset: ProteinGAN generated novel domains that are not present in the existing MDH family (left). In contrast to ProteinGAN-generated sequences, randomly introducing mutations does not expand MDH sequence diversity (Fisher's exact test p -value &lt; 8.2e-16), but rather decreases CATH domain diversity (right). For random controls, 10 000 mutated natural sequences were simultaneously searched for presence of CATH domains (see Methods). c) Comparison of sequence diversity between generated sequences and the natural MDH dataset.
