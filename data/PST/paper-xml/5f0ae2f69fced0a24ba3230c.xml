<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this article, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm (named as, student psychology based optimization (SPBO)) is proposed. The proposed SPBO algorithm is based on the psychology of the students who are trying to give more effort to improve their performance in the examination up to the level for becoming the best student in the class. Performance of the proposed SPBO is analyzed while applying the algorithm to solve thirteen 50 dimensional benchmark functions as well as fifteen CEC 2015 benchmark problems. Results of the SPBO is compared to the performance of ten other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, teaching learning based optimization, cuckoo search algorithm, symbiotic organism search, covariant matrix adaptation with evolution strategy, success-history based adaptive differential evolution, grey wolf optimization, butterfly optimization algorithm, poor and rich optimization algorithm, and barnacles mating optimizer. For fair analysis, performances of all these algorithms are analyzed based on the optimum results obtained as well as based on convergence mobility of the objective function. Pairwise and multiple comparisons are performed to analyze the statistical performance of the proposed method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Application of classical optimization methodology may not yield an optimum solution for complicated engineering problems. For that reason, in the last few decades, application of different metaheuristic optimization algorithms may be noticed to solve different complicated problems in various fields like science, engineering, management, economics etc. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms use an initial set of solutions to obtain the optimal solution. In the last few decades, lots of metaheuristic optimization algorithms have been proposed by the researchers. All of these algorithms use different methodologies to find out the optimum solution.</p><p>To solve various engineering problems, application of metaheuristic algorithms is very much common. One of the most common optimization algorithms is genetic algorithm (GA), proposed by Holland <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. GA is based on the evolution theory of Darwin. Another very common nature inspired algorithm is particle swarm optimization (PSO), proposed by Kennedy and Eberhart <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. PSO is inspired by the movement of swarm to find the best position within a closed boundary. Inspired by the natural behavior of honey bee to collect honey from the flowers, Kang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed artificial bee colony algorithm. Ant colony optimization is based on foraging behavior of ant <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In the recent past, various nature inspired algorithms are available like tabu search <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, harmony search (HS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, bat algorithm [9], big bang-big crunch (BBBC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, plant growth simulation optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, artificial immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, differential evolution (DE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and so on. HS has been proposed by Lee and Geem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to find an optimum solution for engineering problems with continuous designing variables. This algorithm is conceptualized using the musical process of search for the state of harmony. BBBC algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is based on the theory of evaluation of the universe. On the other hand, BFO is inspired by the behavior of bacteria, called chemotaxis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. It is based on the local optimization performed by the bacteria where they try to climb up the nutrient concentration to avoid a noxious substance and search for a way out of neutral media. This algorithm is used to obtain global optimum solution but its performance is not up to the standard as compared to other optimization algorithms used in the very recent days. It takes lots of time to execute. SFLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is a population based optimization algorithm which performs local search and exchanges global information simultaneously. PSO is adopted to perform the local optimization search of SFLA. Based on the learning process of the students, Rao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> proposed TLBO algorithm. This algorithm is divided into two phases named as, teacher phase where the learners use to gain knowledge from their teachers while the other phase is learner phase where the students use to gain knowledge by interacting with other students of the class. Yang and Deb <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> have proposed cuckoo search (CS) optimization algorithm. It is inspired by natural behavior of the cuckoo bird and its process of laying eggs in the nest of some other birds.</p><p>Some other nature inspired optimization algorithms may also be noticed in the literature, such as grey wolf optimization (GWO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, animal migration optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, dolphin echolocation algorithm (DEA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, virus colony search <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, flower pollination algorithm (FPA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, stochastic fractal search <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, gravitational search algorithm (GSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. GWO algorithm is inspired by the behavior of grey wolves and this algorithm is based on their leadership and hunting nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In GWO, the total population is divided into four types of wolves, named as alpha, beta, delta and omega. The hunting process is also divided into three main steps named as, searching for prey, encircling the prey and attacking the prey. The algorithm searches a global optimum solution based on the nature of the grey wolves. Based on the natural process of dolphin to locate the food using echo, Kaveh and Farhoudi <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed DEA. FPA is also based on the natural process. It uses the natural process of flower pollination to identify optimum solution from the search space. Another important optimization algorithm is GSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that works based on Newtonian gravity which states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Application of different hybrid optimization algorithms like GA-PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, GA-fuzzy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> etc. may also be found in different works to solve various kinds of optimization problems in the domain of science and engineering related applications.</p><p>Symbiotic organisms search (SOS) is a new optimization algorithm, proposed by Cheng and Prayogo in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. It is inspired by the relationship between different spices so as to survive and improve their fitness. SOS uses three different phases (viz., mutualism phase, commensalism phase and parasitism phase) to explain the relationship between various spices and their activity to survive (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>). Based on these three phases, SOS algorithm tries to obtain the global optimum solution for any problem. Another newly proposed nature inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm is runner-root algorithm, proposed by Bayat in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. It is based on the function of runners and roots of some plants and their movement to search water and minerals from the soil. Based on the behavior of the grasshoppers, Saremi et al. have proposed grasshoppers optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Many other optimization algorithms have been proposed in the recent days which include satin bower-bird optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, dragonflies algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, social mimic optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, poor and rich optimization (PRO) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, black widow optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, barnacles mating optimizer (BMO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and so on.</p><p>Performance of most of the metaheuristic algorithms depends on their parameter selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Convergence properties of different algorithms are different. Some of the algorithms have faster convergence mobility of the objective function to obtain the global optimum solution. Convergence profile is measured against the number of iterations/ number of fitness function evaluations (NFFEs). To find the optimum solution, it is desired that the optimization algorithms should take less NFFEs to obtain the optimum solution. At the same time, it should also take less computational time. But most of the available metaheuristic optimization algorithms exhibit slower convergence mobility and takes higher computational time to converge to the global optimum solution.</p><p>The main objective of this paper is to propose a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm which is based on the student psychology and an attempt has been made to explore the same to solve global optimization problems. Student psychology based optimization (SPBO) is inspired by the student psychology who is trying to obtain the highest marks/grade in the examination. Students always try to obtain good marks in the examination but the performance of a student depends upon her/his efficiency and interest to the subject offered to her/him. Based on this psychology, students try to give their best effort to improve their performance as well as try to obtain good marks aiming to be the best student in the class. To analyse the performance of the SPBO, the algorithm is applied to solve thirteen standard benchmark functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Performance of the SPBO is compared to the performance of ten state-of-the-art optimization algorithms such as PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, covariant matrix adaptation with evolution strategy (CMA-ES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, success-history based adaptive DE (SHADE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO. The performance has been analysed based on the optimum result obtained as well as based on the convergence mobility it exhibits. Convergence profiles of the algorithms have been analysed in the present work as because the main objective of this paper is to present a new optimization algorithm that is capable to obtain the global optimum solution with faster convergence feature. Performance of the SPBO is further analysed by applying the algorithm to solve CEC 2015 problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and the results are compared to the results obtained while using the aforementioned algorithms. The CEC-2015 problems are consisting of two unimodals, seven multimodals, three hybrid functions and three composition functions. Comparison study of all the adopted algorithms has been reported in this paper. Statistical comparison has been performed to demonstrate the performance of the SPBO in comparison to the performance exhibited by PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The proposed SPBO algorithm is presented in the next section. Parameter selection and the importance of different phases of the SPBO are discussed in Section 3. Performance of the proposed SPBO to solve standard benchmark function as well as CEC 2015 problems are reported in Section 4. Section 5 presents a statistical analysis of the proposed SPBO algorithm. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6. Some future directions are also included in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SPBO: the proposed algorithm</head><p>Performance of a student is measured in terms of marks obtained in the examination. The student who obtained the highest marks in the examination is said to be the best student of the class and s/he is awarded accordingly for the same. Usually, students present in the class try to improve her/his performance for becoming the best student in the class. For that, the students need to give more effort to improve their performance in each subject offered to them. The proposed SPBO algorithm works on the psychology of the students who are trying to obtain the highest marks and try to be the best student by the way of improving their performance in the examination. The authors of the present work came to know about the stated psychology of the students after studying the behavior of the different students and talking to them. This study has been carried out in different schools, colleges as well as different universities of West Bengal, India for the last four years.</p><p>To be the best student in the class, students need to score more than the rest of the students present in the class. To accomplish this objective, they need to give more effort to the subjects offered to them. They need to perform well in each of the subjects so that their overall grade is improved. So, the students need to give effort subject wise to improve overall performance. But the effort given by any student to any subject depends on the students' capability, efficiency as well as interest in that subject. Therefore, it may be noted that improvement of performance in the examination of all the students is not the same and may vary from student to student. To be the best student, the effort given by the students also depends on the students' psychology. Some of the students try to improve her/his performance by giving similar or better kind of effort given by the best student. At the same time, some of the students try to give efforts considering the effort given by the best student as well as try to give more efforts than the efforts given by the average students in the class. Improvement of the students' performance depends upon the effort given by them. As the amount of effort given by a student to a subject depends on the interest of the student to that subject, the students always will try to give more effort subject wise so that their overall grade in the examination is improved. Based on the above discussion, the students of a class may be subject wise categorized into four categories, as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>A Best student: The student who obtained the highest overall marks/ grade in the examination is said to be the best student in the class.</p><p>The best student will always try to maintain her/his position by obtaining the highest marks in the class. To obtain the highest marks and to maintain her/his position, the best student needs to give more effort to each of the subjects than the efforts given by the rest of the students. So, it may be understood that the best student needs to give more effort than the effort given by any randomly selected student. Improvement of the best student may be expressed with the help of (1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= + × × X X rand X X ( 1) ( ) bestnew best k best j (1)</formula><p>where, X best and X j are, respectively, the marks obtained by the best student and randomly selected jth student in a particular subject, rand is a random number in between 0 and 1 and k is a parameter which is randomly selected as either 1 or 2. The main objective of the best student is to improve her/his performance in each subject so that her/his overall marks improve and s/he can maintain her/his best position. B Good student: If a student finds interest in any subject, then s/he will try to give more and more effort to that subject so that her/his overall performance gets improved. This category of the student may be said, subject wise good student. The selection of this category of student is a random process because the psychologies of different students are different. To be the best student by obtaining the highest marks/grade in the examination, some of the students try to give similar or better kind of effort given by the best student. This category of the student may be represented with the help of (2a). At the same time, some of the students try to give more effort in their study than the effort given by the average students of the class as well as try to follow the effort given by the best student. This category of student may be expressed with the help of (2b)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= + × X X rand X X [ ( )] newi best best i (2a) = + × + × X X rand X X rand X X [ ( )] [ ( )] newi i best i i mean (2b)</formula><p>where, X i is the marks/grade obtained by the ith student in that subject, X mean is the average performance of the class in that particular subject and rand is a random number in between 0 and 1. C Average student: As the effort given by a student depends on the interest of the student in the subjects offered to them, the students will offer an average effort to that subject, if the student is less interested in some of the subjects. While giving an average effort to that subject, the students will try to give more effort to other subjects so that their overall marks get improved. This category of students may be said as the subject wise average student. Depending on different students' psychology, selection of this category of student is also a random process. Performance of this category of student may be represented by using (3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= + × X X rand X X [ ( )] newi i mean i (3)</formula><p>where, X i and mean are, in order, the marks obtained by the ith student and the average marks obtained by the class in that particular subject and rand is a random number in between 0 and 1. D Students who try to improve randomly: Except these three aforementioned categories of students, some students try to improve their performance by themselves. They try to give effort to the subject randomly to some extent depending upon the subject. This category of student tries to give effort randomly to the subject so that overall performance in the examination improves. Performance of this category of the student may be expressed with the help of (4)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= + × X X rand X X [ ( )] newi min min max<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where, X min and X max are the minimum and the maximum limit of marks of the subject, respectively. As described above, SPBO algorithm is based on the psychology of the student. Incorporating the aforesaid four types of psychologies of the students, the proposed SPBO may be represented with the help of the flowchart shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The pseudo-code of this algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1. As like other metaheuristics, SPBO works on an initial population which is analogues to the student of a class. Each population (student) is consisting of different variables which are analogues to the different subjects offered to them. Students try to give effort to the subjects in order to improve overall performance in the examination. The overall marks/grade obtained by a student may be said as the fitness of the population. The effort given by the students will be appreciated if the overall performance of the student in the examination improves. Similarly, change of variables will be accepted, if the fitness of the population improves. It has been considered in this algorithm that the students try to give their effort based on their interest to those subjects. It may happen that a student may find interest in some subject but s/he has less/average interest in some other subject. For example, let us consider a student is interested in a subject (say, X), so s/he will give more effort to the subject X. It may be said the student is a subject wise good student for the subject X. But on the other hand, it may happen that the considered student is to be average interested in another subject (say, Y). Similarly, the student may be less interested (subject wise) in some other subject (say, Z). The effort given by a student to a subject depends on the interest gained in the subject, which depends on the students' psychology and may vary from student to student and subject wise. It may be noted that subject wise interest gain is a random process. Based on this psychology, subject wise categorization of the students is considered as a random process in the proposed SPBO algorithm. Except the best student, subject wise selection of rest three categories of students (such as, good student, average student and students who try to improve randomly) has been considered as a random process. There is no numerical value to decide the structural decisions, which may be treated as an advantage of this algorithm. To ensure that the solutions lie within the feasible region, the modified population needs to be checked after undergoing modification at each stage to ensure whether the populations are within the feasible region or not. If any of the new population is found out to be out of the region, then that population needs to be bounded within the limits. In every stage, the performance of the class is calculated. The population having the best fitness is considered as the best student in the class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Parameter selection of SPBO and importance of its different phases</head><p>In the recent days, lots of optimization algorithms are available and are being used in different fields. But performances of most of the algorithms are dependent on the selection of certain parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The parameters of the algorithms need to be adjusted properly to optimize the performance of the algorithm. Otherwise, it may not lead to the optimum solution. Tuning of the parameters is one of the major problems associated with the metaheuristic optimization algorithms available now-a-days.</p><p>However, the proposed SPBO algorithm does not have as such any tuneable parameter. The only thing that needs to be selected/adjusted for the SPBO is the population size. As such, selection of the population size is common for all the metaheuristic optimization algorithms. The population size needs to be adjusted according to the performance of the algorithms which varies with the number of unknown variables of the problem. The optimum population size also varies from algorithm to algorithm. To select optimum population size for the SPBO, the algorithm has been applied to solve five standard benchmark functions, namely Step, Sum square, Sphere, Rastrigin and Quartic. The optimum population size has been determined using sensitivity analysis for all the aforementioned five benchmark functions. Sensitivity analysis has been done by varying the population size and analysing performance in terms of optimum solution achieved as well as based on the convergence mobility. For statistical analysis purpose, the algorithm has been run for twenty-five times for each set of the population for each benchmark functions considered here. For analysis purpose, it has been considered that the solution is converged when it reaches below 1E-5 and it has been also considered that a particular value of below 1E-5 is equal to zero. As because SPBO is, mainly, applied in this paper to optimize the solution for 30 dimension (30D) and 50D benchmark functions, so statistical sensitivity analysis has been done for both 30D as well as 50D benchmark functions to optimize population size.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the statistical sensitivity analysis for 30D benchmark functions while Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the same for 50D benchmark functions. From Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, it may be noticed that the SPBO is able to offer an optimum solution in each run for all the five considered benchmark functions when the population size is considered above 15. But while considering convergence mobility, it may be noticed that the SPBO takes lesser NFFEs to converge when the population is considered to be 20 and 15 for 30D and 50D benchmark functions, respectively.</p><p>It is mentioned earlier that the proposed SPBO is based on the psychology of the students present in a class. The students present in the class have been classified based on their subject wise performance into four categories (viz., best student, good student, average students and students who try to improve randomly). Similarly, the SPBO may be subdivided into four phases, named as best student, good student, average student and students who try to improve randomly. Performance of the SPBO depends on the performance of all the aforementioned four phases. A question may come into the readers' mind that how all these phases are important to build the algorithm. So, to analyse the importance and the contribution of each phase to the performance of the algorithm, the algorithm has been applied to all the five 50D benchmark functions considered in this study.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the performance of the different phases of the SPBO while contributing to optimize performance of the algorithm for the considered five 50D benchmark functions. It may be noticed from this figure that the contribution of the best student to reach the optimum solution is much more for all the considered five benchmark functions. But it may be also observed that all the phases have their contribution to achieve an optimum solution and to reach the converging point. So, it may be apprehended that all the phases have their important roles in the performance of the algorithm. To shape the SPBO, all the four phases are required which helps the algorithm to obtain optimum solution with faster convergence mobility. If any of the phases does not work or is eliminated, then the algorithm may either not yield the desired optimal solution or it may take higher NFFEs to converge. Thus, the SPBO works well only when all the four phases are executed simultaneously.</p></div>

Parameters of the adopted eleven optimization algorithms are tabulated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. Analysis of all the considered algorithms has been done based on the optimum results obtained as well as based on the convergence mobility. Convergence criterion is the same as stated in Section 3. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> includes the parameter details of all the considered algorithms. It may be noticed that the population size is considered to be 100 for each of the algorithms like PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO. For CMA-ES, the same is considered to be 160. But the SPBO does not require such large population size. The population of SPBO is considered as 15 only.</p><p>Statistical analysis of all the eleven optimization algorithms has been tabulated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>. Performance ranking of all the algorithms has been done based on the optimum result obtained, as well as based on faster convergence mobility yielded. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>, it may be focussed that performance of the SPBO is better as compared to the results obtained using PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO. Convergence mobility of the objective function for the SPBO is faster as compared to other optimization algorithms considered in this work. Out of thirteen 50D functions, the SPBO holds 1st rank for twelve problems and holds 2nd rank for f 9 . The SOS holds 1st rank for f 9. So, it may be apprehended that the SPBO works better to find the optimum solution for higher dimensional problems as compared to other algorithms considered in this paper (viz., PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS,  C 1 C 2 = 2 100 10E+5 w max = 0.9, min = 0.4 TLBO <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> Teaching factor = either 1 or 2 100 10E+5 CS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> Levy co-efficient = 0.5 100 10E+5 Discovery rate of alien eggs = 0.25 SOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> NA 100 10E+5 CMA-ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> NA 160 10E+5 SHADE <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> Crossover rate = 0.1 100 10E+5 GWO <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> Component coefficient vectors (a) = linearly decreasing from 2 to 0 100 10E+5 BOA <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> Switch probability (p) = 0.8 100 10E+5 Sensory modality (C) = 0.01 Power exponent (a) = 0.1 PRO <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> Mutation probability (Pmut) = 0.06 100 10E+5 BMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> Percentage    CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO).</p><p>The study has been further carried out by applying the SPBO to solve CEC 2015 benchmark problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Chosen CEC 2015 benchmark problems are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. Among the listed fifteen CEC-2015 problems, there are two unimodal functions (F1, F2), seven are multimodal functions (F3-F9), three are hybrid functions (F10-F12) and three are composition functions (F13-F15). All these fifteen benchmark functions are of 30D. The parameters for this case are considered to be the same as those of the previous ones (refer Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>), except the population size. The population size of PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES and SHADE are considered as 50 for each, while the same is considered as 20 for the SPBO. To analyse the performance of all the eleven algorithms for CEC 2015 benchmark test, the main focus has been given on the optimum solution obtained.</p><p>The statistical results of all the fifteen benchmark functions for CEC 2015 have been reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>. From this statistical analysis, it may be noticed that the performance of the SPBO is better as compared to other considered algorithms. The SPBO is able to obtain minimum value for thirteen benchmark functions out of fifteen CEC 2015 benchmark functions whereas SOS and CS are able to obtain minimum value for two functions (F2 and F14) and one (F10) problem, respectively.</p><p>Performance of the SPBO is quite better for both the cases (i.e. 50D benchmark test function and CEC 2015 benchmark test function) as compared to other ten considered algorithms. The performance rank summery has been made in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">8</ref>. It may be noticed from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">8</ref>, that out of twenty-eight considered benchmark functions, the SPBO stands 1st rank for twenty-five benchmark functions and rank 2nd for two benchmark functions. From the study, it may be noticed that the SPBO is quite able to find the global optimum solution with faster convergence mobility. So, from this study, it may be set on that the performance of the SPBO is better in terms of optimum solution obtained as well as based on the convergence mobility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Statistical analysis on performance of the proposed algorithm</head><p>To analyse the performance of the SPBO, statistical analysis has been carried out and presented in this section. This analysis has been done based on the performance of eleven considered optimization algorithms including the proposed one for the considered twenty-eight benchmark functions (thirteen 50D benchmark function, fifteen CEC 2015 benchmark functions). Two pairwise comparisons and two multiple comparisons have been carried out. For statistical analysis, it is considered that the performance of all the algorithms is equal to the null hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Pairwise comparisons</head><p>The pairwise comparisons are performed based on direct comparisons of two algorithms when applied to a common set of problems. Two pairwise comparisons have been done. The first one is the sign test while the second one is the Wilcoxon sign test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">The sign test</head><p>This test is an easy and popular one to analyse the performance of an algorithm compared to some other algorithms. In this test, performances of two algorithms are compared based on performance exhibited by the algorithms for each case. Overall, the win of each algorithm is counted over the other algorithms. The algorithm which has higher overall win will be considered as better one as compared to the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref> shows the statistical sign test performance comparison of the SPBO over the other ten algorithms considered in this study (viz., PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO). It may be fascinating to note that the performance of the SPBO is better as compared to all other algorithms considered in this study. This result easily eliminates the null hypothesis. It may be also said that the performance of the SPBO is, significantly, better as compared to other ten considered optimization algorithms with a level of significance, α = 0.01.</p></div>

This test is analogous to the statistical paired t-test. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test is applied to a pair to test results with an aim to detect a significant difference in performance between the two algorithms. This test is more sensitive than the t-test. It is based on commensurability of differences but only qualitatively: greater difference counts for more but the absolute magnitudes are ignored. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test does not assume normal distributions which is safer from the statistical point of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">10</ref> shows the Wilcoxon signed rank test results for the performance of the SPBO as compared to PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO. It may be noted that R+ is the sum of the ranks for which the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithm while R-is the sum of ranks for the opposite. The R+, R-and p-values are to be calculated. An algorithm with p&lt; 0.05 is considered as the significantly better algorithm as compared to the other one <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">10</ref>, it may be perceived that the proposed algorithm outstripped the other algorithms considered in this study. It may be also noticed that performance of the SPBO is, significantly, better with R+ of 406 as compared to all the six algorithms (TLBO, CMA-ES, GWO, BOAm PRO and BMO) under consideration. R+ value in comparison to  The p-values of the SPBO, as compared to the other algorithms, eliminates the null hypothesis and proves that the performance of the SPBO is, significantly, better with a significance level of 0.01.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Multiple comparisons</head><p>When performance of an algorithm needs to be analysed by   comparing the achieved result with the results obtained using more than one algorithm, multiple comparisons are more preferable than the pairwise one. The multiple comparisons may be done based on the performance of the proposed algorithm as compared to all other considered algorithms. In this section, two multiple comparison tests have been done. The first one is multiple sign test while the second one is the Friedman test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">The Multiple sign test</head><p>This test allows identifying and highlighting the algorithm which is having statistically better performance compared to other algorithms under study <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref>, it may be noticed that the performance of the SPBO is better as compared to all other algorithms considered in this study. From this test, it may be found that the SPBO wins most of the cases when compared to rest of the algorithms which proves that the performance of the SPBO is, significantly, better as compared to rest of the algorithms with a significance level of 0.01. This study also rejects the null hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2.">The Friedman test</head><p>This test is one of the popular tests to highlight better algorithm among a few considered algorithms. The Friedman test ranks the algorithms for each problem separately. In this test, the algorithms are ranked based on their performances. The best performance is considered as rank 1, the second best as rank 2 and so on. In case of ties, the average rank is considered. Thus, the overall average rank is calculated for each algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>The Friedman test results have been tabulated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">11</ref>, which shows that the average rank of eleven algorithms based on their performances to solve the problems. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">11</ref> shows that the average rank of the SPBO is 1.21, which is only possible if it stands first in most of the cases. So, performance wise it may be said that the SPBO is, significantly, superior as compared to PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO. Better performance of the SPBO easily rejects the null hypothesis and proves its superiority over the other ten considered algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Inference from statistical analysis</head><p>For all the tests (i.e. pairwise comparisons and multiple comparisons), the SPBO proves pre-eminence in all the benchmark problems over all other optimization algorithms considered in this study. From this statistical comparison test, it may be inferred that the SPBO is better as compared to PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO counterparts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and scope of future work</head><p>In this work, a new nature inspired optimization algorithm is proposed. The proposed SPBO algorithm is based on the students' psychology to obtain the highest marks/grade in the examination. This algorithm does not have any adjustable parameter that may influence its performance. To analyse the performance of the proposed algorithm, it is applied to solve thirteen 50D standard benchmark functions. The obtained results using the SPBO are compared to the results obtained using ten other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (viz., PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO). For a fair comparison, the obtained results of all the eleven algorithms are analysed based on the optimum results obtained as well as based on the convergence mobility (i.e. NFFEs taken to converge). From this study, it is seen that the SPBO holds 1st rank for twelve benchmark functions out of thirteen considered 50D benchmark functions. It is found that the SPBO works better in terms of capability to obtain the optimum result as well as based on faster converging mobility as compared to other algorithms considered in this study. The study has been further extended by applying the SPBO to solve CEC 2015 benchmark functions.</p><p>The obtained SPBO based results are compared to the results obtained using other ten considered benchmark functions. From the comparison study, it is noticed that the SPBO holds 1st rank for thirteen benchmark functions out of fifteen CEC 2015 benchmark functions. The performance of the SPBO is found to be better than the other algorithms considered in this work.</p><p>To analyse the performance of the SPBO, statistical tests are performed which includes two pairwise comparison tests (i.e. the sign test and the Wilcoxon signed ranks test) and two multiple comparisons tests (i.e. the multiple sign test and the Friedman rank test). For all the considered cases, performance of the SPBO is found to be better as compared to that of other ten considered optimization algorithms. It may be said from this study, that the proposed SPBO algorithm is better as compared to other considered algorithms with a significance level of 0.01.</p><p>From the benchmark function test (both 50D benchmark functions as well as CEC 2015), it may be concluded that the SPBO is able to obtain the optimum solution with faster convergence mobility and its performance is better as compared to PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO and BMO.</p><p>To sustain in the flood of optimization algorithm, a newly proposed algorithm needs to be novel as well as it should has better performance. The performance of the SPBO, as presented in this work, proves its superiority over the previous algorithms in terms of achievement of global optimum solution as well as faster convergence mobility. So, it may be concluded that the proposed SPBO algorithm may be applied by the future researchers in some other domains like engineering, science as well as management. </p></div>

multimodal separable types and three multimodal non-separable types. Unimodal functions are those functions which have only one optimum solution. At that same time, the functions which include two or more local optima can be called as the multimodal functions. A function is separable if that function can be represented as a sum of functions of just one variable. Compared to the separable, getting the optimum solution of a non-separable function is more difficult as the accurate search depends on two or more associated variables. So, among the considered benchmark functions of Table</p>3</p>, the multimodal non-separable functions are more difficult to get optimum solution as the search direction needs to be accurate for different variables as well as need to overcome the local optima to obtain the global optimum solution. The landscape representations of the considered benchmark functions with two variables have been portrayed in Fig.</p>4</p>. Performance of the SPBO is compared to the results obtained by using PSO, TLBO, CS, SOS, CMA-ES, SHADE, GWO, BOA, PRO, and</p></note></figure>
