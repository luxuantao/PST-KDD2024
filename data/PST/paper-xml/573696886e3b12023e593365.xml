<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Since the late 70s, much research activity has taken place on the class of dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRP), with the time period after year 2000 witnessing a real explosion in related papers. Our paper sheds more light into work in this area over more than 3 decades by developing a taxonomy of DVRP papers according to 11 criteria. These are (1) type of problem, (2) logistical context, (3) transportation mode, (4) objective function, (5) fleet size, (6) time constraints, (7) vehicle capacity constraints, (8) the ability to reject customers, (9) the nature of the dynamic element, (10) the nature of the stochasticity (if any), and (11) the solution method. We comment on technological vis-à-vis methodological advances for this class of problems and suggest directions for further research. The latter include alternative objective functions, vehicle speed as decision variable, more explicit linkages of methodology to technological advances and analysis of worst case or average case performance of heuristics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Research on Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems (DVRPs) has grown considerably over the last 3 decades or so. The last published survey paper on this topic, Pillac et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[120]</ref>, catalogued some 154 references. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> breaks down these references time-wise. Even though not all these references refer to DVRPs, the majority definitely does and the graph of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> can certainly be considered as a good proxy for the publication trend in this area. Of particular interest is the time period after year 2000, in which a real explosion of related publications seems to have taken place.</p><p>More impressive is perhaps the fact that his trend has continued even after the Pillac et al. paper. In fact as of mid-May, 2015 the above paper had as many as 194 citations in Scholar This article attempts to answer this set of questions by developing a taxonomy of papers written on this set of problems. The taxonomy is based on the following 11 criteria: (1) type of problem, (2) logistical context, (3) transportation mode, (4) objective function, (5) fleet size, (6) time constraints, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> vehicle capacity constraints, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> the ability to reject customers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> the nature of the dynamic element, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> the nature of the stochasticity (if any), and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> the solution method.</p><p>To our knowledge, no other prior survey on the DVRP has developed a taxonomy of this nature and actually the need for a taxonomy or classification scheme was already recognized in such surveys. For instance, in their conclusions Pillac et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[120]</ref> suggested that "further work should aim at creating a taxonomy of dynamic vehicle routing problems, possibly by extending existing research on static routing". Similarly, Bektaş at al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> recommended a "development of taxonomies and classification schemes" in the sense that "although various taxonomies and classification schemes have been proposed in earlier survey papers, the boundaries and similarities among different problem variants as well as links with particular applications need to be clearly defined."</p><p>A clarification that should be made here is that the word "problem" in acronyms such as VRP, DVRP and others in this article refers to the abstract problem as formulated in the specific paper under survey, and not to the corresponding real-world problem. The distinction is important as it is the formulation of a VRP that is important from a methodological standpoint, and different papers may formulate (and solve) a specific real-world problem in a different way.</p><p>A related clarification is that what we mean by a taxonomy in this article is a taxonomy of DVRP papers rather than a taxonomy of DVRPs. This is why the solution method (criterion 11), being intimately connected to the formulation of the (abstract) problem under consideration in a paper, is also part of the taxonomy. It can obviously be seen that the taxonomy of DVRPs is related to the taxonomy of DVRP papers and can be derived from it by suppressing criterion 11. This is tantamount to considering as a single entry in the taxonomy all entries in which criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> are the same.</p><p>Material on this article is based mainly on the papers catalogued in Pillac et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[120]</ref> and Bektaş et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, with the following further processing:</p><p>1. A first filtering excluded books, PhD dissertations, benchmark datasets, and nonVRP papers. 2. A further number of references were also excluded, being survey papers, e-commerce papers, framework papers, conceptual approaches, formulations only, or papers only dealing with static and deterministic VRPs. 3. A number of additional papers published from 2011 to 2014 (main source: SCOPUS) were added, excluding working papers, survey papers, and papers written in other languages (mainly Chinese). 4. Finally, we added a number of working papers and papers in conference proceedings in our survey.</p><p>The total number of references after these steps came down to 117. A table classifying each of these references according to the 11 criteria of the taxonomy is included in Appendix A (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Due to space limitations it was impossible to comment on all the papers in the taxonomy. However, short comments have been included for close to 50 of them throughout the article.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses technological advances that may be relevant for DVRPs over the period of study. Section 3 presents the taxonomy, as per the 11 criteria. Section 4 presents the paper's conclusions and discusses areas for possible further research. Appendix B (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>) is the list of acronyms and abbreviations used in the article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">General</head><p>Throughout the DVRP literature over the years, it has been mentioned time and again that advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and related technologies are critical for this specific class of problems, mainly because their dynamic nature would necessitate such technologies on the one hand, and make optimal use of these technologies on the other.</p><p>If one compares the late 70s with the present time, one could say that related technologies have advanced by several orders of magnitude. One of the authors of this article still remembers hauling boxes of punched cards from his student office to the MIT Computer Center several buildings away, where students and faculty valiantly punched their computer programs in a room full of IBM 129 card punching machines, and these programs were run in batch mode on computers like the IBM 370 or equivalent. There was even a locker room to store the boxes. Not really a very efficient way to execute a DVRP code, but this was later alleviated by the introduction of time-sharing systems that could run computer programs remote-distance via an acoustic coupler and a CRT (cathode ray tube) terminal. Later came mini-computers, microcomputers, and even later, among other things, personal computers, email, the internet, cell telephony, laptops, smartphones, various pads and tablets, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), e-freight, e-commerce, Big Data, and cloud computing. Unmanned vehicles and drone usage are being contemplated as serious transportation and distribution alternatives in the future. It is fair to say that all of this evolution, spanning less than 4 decades, has been anything but spectacular.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Advances in Computing Power</head><p>It has been observed that over the history of computing hardware the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years, resulting in periodic increases in computing power <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref>. The so-called "Moore's law" currently retains its predictive power, and is being now used by industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, the so-called "global semiconductor road maps." Besides CPU performance, the performance and, also the size, of disk drives are also increasing.</p><p>A number of VRP papers present a mixed integer programming (MIP) model that is solved using commercial solvers or using a heuristic approach and then compared with the solution of the commercial solver. Progress in solving real-world MIP instances has been exceptional over the last years and one example is the solvability of the MIPLIB 2003, a standard test set for comparing the performance of mixed integer optimization codes. At the start of MIPLIB 2003 there were 22 easy, 3 hard, and 35 open instances and by the end of 2010 there were just 15 instances classified as hard, and only 4 open instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[116]</ref>. Another showcase is the speedup of commercial MIP solvers. Bixby and Rothberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> report that in 2004 an LP was solved, by Cplex 8, a million times faster than it was by Cplex 1 in 1990. That is three orders of magnitudes due to hardware and to software improvements. Combining the pure algorithmic speedup with the speedup in computing machinery, it seems that solving MIPs has become something like 100 million times faster in the last 20 years according to Koch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[93]</ref>.</p><p>What do such advances in computing power mean in terms of better being able to solve DVRPs? One would think for instance that a (say) 1,000,000-fold increase in storage capacity in the last 35 years would translate in a spectacular increase on the sizes of problems that can be handled. This is not necessarily the case however, and likely it is only true for heuristic approaches whose memory requirements grow polynomially with problem size. Perhaps as an extreme example, the memory requirement to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exactly by dynamic programming grows as O(n2 n ), where n is the number of nodes, and CPU time grows as O(n 2 2 n ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref>. Just on memory considerations alone, a size limit of (say) 20 nodes in the late 70s would translate into a size limit of about 28 nodes 35 years later for the same algorithm, if storage capacity grew 1,000,000 times in between. If the ratio becomes 10 million or even 100 million, the effect on problem size would be only additive, not multiplicative. A similar argument can be made for CPU time and for other exact approaches. As all DVRPs are NP-hard, any attempt to solve them exactly will encounter this problem. This is of course not true for heuristics whose memory requirements and CPU time evolve polynomially, and hopefully as low-power polynomial functions. This means that perhaps the most serious beneficiary of advances in computing power over the last 3 decades or so are heuristic approaches for the DVRP. And indeed, the requirement for faster computation times due to the nature of the problem points to these approaches as the most promising, at least from a practical perspective, methodological tools for this class of problems. Our survey tends to confirm this trend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Big Data and Predictive Analytics</head><p>Another recent technological advance is related to the field of Big Data, which has drawn significant attention from operations researchers. Big Data is a broad term for large and complex sets that traditional data processing applications are inadequate to cope with. Nowadays more than ever companies in every sector are collecting large amounts of data. Data sets grow in size in part because they are increasingly being gathered by inexpensive and numerous connected devices such as smartphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers, webcams, and wireless sensors. These devices continuously generate data streams without any human intervention and there is a need to streamline the collection, analysis and decision making based on this data. The ability to efficiently collect and process such data is expected to enhance decision making in DVRPs.</p><p>The term Big Data refers to extraordinarily large datasets that in the past could not be handled due to various limitations. Advances in data storage and computing power have led to new techniques for storing large datasets. Data mining includes finding patterns and correlations in the data-and data visualization. The latter is related to the presentation of data in a graphical format and can be also done in an interactive way. Effective visualization of large data is important so that patterns and other information can be spotted and interpreted easily by the decision makers.</p><p>The innovation unit of DHL Express published a new trend report <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, entitled Big Data in Logistics to "move beyond the hype" that focuses on the value of Big Data for the company and its customers. One of the major questions posed was how to use big data information to improve the operational efficiency and customer experience, and create useful new business models. This report mentions that many providers realize that Big Data is a game-changing trend for the logistics industry and quote the results of a recent study on supply chain trends, where 60% of the respondents stated that they are planning to invest in Big Data analytics within the next 5 years (2014-2019).</p><p>Predictive analytics is a related concept that uses a variety of statistical techniques from modeling, machine learning, data mining and other techniques to analyze real-time and historical facts in order make predictions about future, or otherwise unknown, events. In fact, this goes beyond forecasting by exploring for correlation among data (e.g., seasonality) and predicts future events based also on current and emerging conditions (e.g., trends) to make predictions about the future, for instance on the anticipated size of the future demand of a specific customer, or of future customers in a specific area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Parallel and GPU Programming</head><p>Given that a serious challenge is to design solution algorithms that can generate solutions in short times, the use of parallel and GPU programming may be useful (see Brodtkorb et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Schulz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[134]</ref> for more). GPU stands for graphical processing units. With the advent of multicore processors on desktop computers and low-cost GPU, parallel computing is now readily available for time-consuming methods. GPUs have been mainly used for graphics, gaming, and video application but have recently become popular in scientific computing. Due to the publication of the CUDA development toolkit, some papers in the metaheurists field that take advance of GPUs have appeared. It seems that the use of GPUs is very promising, especially given that a CPU can calculate in certain circumstances even 40 times faster than a conventional CPU. Having said this, we should note that most approaches reviewed in this article do not take advantage of parallel computing. Some exceptions are listed in Section 3.11.1. It is expected that the future development of parallel algorithms will be able to further reduce the computational time needed especially in the case of dynamic problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Other Advances</head><p>Finally, as regards other advances, one can group personal computers, email, the internet, cell telephony, laptops, smartphones, and various pads, tablets and apps as advances that can help the potential DVRP customer better manage his or her request. E-freight and e-commerce systems are supposed to do the same, and substantial Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities are devoted to these topics, at least in the European Union's (EU) R&amp;D funding programs. The combined 2014 &amp; 2015 budget of the EU Horizon 2020 ICT program is €1.6 billion and of the Horizon 2020 Transport program is € 0.88 billion. None of these programs has R&amp;D explicitly foreseen in the area of VRP (much less DVRP), but there are several calls in related areas such as logistics, multimodal transport and others. Technologies like GPS, GIS, and ITS also receive substantial funding. The main client of these technologies is the supply side, that is, companies involved in vehicle dispatching, the vehicles themselves and the drivers.</p><p>The application of innovative technologies in ICT and ITS in freight transportation allows the dynamic collection of data (such as vehicle and cargo location, sender and receiver information, loading and unloading information, traffic and infrastructure information, vehicle load, inventory information, etc.) that can be potentially used to optimize the planning in both a dynamic and stochastic setting. The reader is referred to Crainic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> that (a) present an assessment of ITS achievements as regards freight, (b) illustrate the convergence of freight ITS and e-business technologies by focusing on electronic auctions, and (c) discuss how the introduction of better decision-support software could significantly improve the performance of transportation systems. In addition, Goel <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> discusses both telematic technologies and heuristic methods that can be used to support real-time monitoring, control, and planning of commercial vehicle operations.</p><p>All of the above technological advances are certainly impressive. However, and in terms of DVRPs, it turns out that in most of the papers that we have reviewed, linkages between methodology and technology seem to be elusive or ill-defined. Some exceptions however exist and this point is further discussed in Section 4.5 in the context of further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">THE TAXONOMY</head><p>Technological advances notwithstanding, a pertinent question is, what have been the equivalent advances in the DVRP state-of-the-art during the same period. The sheer number of papers published on this topic provides a partial, albeit high-level answer. The taxonomy developed in this section will attempt to answer the same question in more detail. As already indicated, the taxonomy classifies papers in the DVRP area according to 11 criteria. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> provides an overview.</p><p>The figure shows that there are 11 main criteria in the taxonomy. Even though each of these criteria is distinct, the criteria are not entirely independent of one another, and in fact we will see some connections among them. The rest of the section provides more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Type of Problem</head><p>A VRP can be static or dynamic, and it can be deterministic or stochastic. All four combinations exist, and by "type of problem" we mean one of these combinations, as follows: SD (static and deterministic) SS (static and stochastic) DD (dynamic and deterministic) DS (dynamic and stochastic)</p><p>We make some clarifications and examples in the following, noting that the type of problem, as defined above, is connected to other criteria of the taxonomy, and especially to that of the solution approach (see <ref type="bibr">Section 3.11)</ref>.</p><p>We first note that critical in the above classification is the definition of the word "dynamic." In this article we use the definition by Psaraftis <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[124]</ref>, according to which a VRP is characterized as dynamic if the input on the problem is received and updated concurrently with the determination of the route. If all problem inputs are received before route determination and do not change thereafter, the VRP is static. As a general rule, if the problem calls for the determination of a set of preplanned routes that are not reoptimized and are computed from inputs that do not evolve in real time, the problem is static. Conversely, if the routes are reoptimized or if the output is a policy that prescribes how the routes should evolve as a function of those inputs that evolve in real time, then the problem is dynamic.</p><p>A static VRP is deterministic (SD) if all of its inputs are known with certainty and there are no stochastic inputs. For obvious reasons, papers that exclusively refer to SD VRPs are not part of our taxonomy. There is already a very large literature on these problems. However, papers that examine both SD and DD variants are included.</p><p>Given that the definition of the word "problem" in our paper refers to the abstract problem examined in a paper and not to the associated real-world problem, it is conceivable that a VRP may be static whereas its associated real-world problem is dynamic. Take for instance the classical TSP, which is obviously an SD problem. It is conceivable that in the associated real-world problem we may see all kinds of dynamic inputs which may force the salesman to alter his or her actual route, for instance traffic congestion, a road closure due to an accident, or others. To the extent that the actual route is altered as a result of such inputs, the real word problem is dynamic. And so is actually the case in many real-world situations, most of which are dynamic even though the associated abstract problem may be static. So it is important that we bear in mind that in our analysis we are talking about the abstract problems as formulated in the papers under consideration.</p><p>In the same context, it should also be realized that some VRPs that at first glance may give the appearance of belonging to the DVRP class are not really dynamic. An example is the Time-dependent TSP (see for instance Malandraki and Daskin <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[106]</ref>). In it, travel times from node to node are not constant, but vary with time, possibly as a result of traffic congestion or other factors that may impact conditions along the route during the day. But given that these variable travel times are known in advance and before the route is determined, this is a static and deterministic (SD) problem. The same is the case for the time-dependent VRP (Dabia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>).</p><p>Some other VRPs can be both static and stochastic (SS). A typical example is the Probabilistic TSP, or PTSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82]</ref>. The PTSP calls for the determination of an a priori route, given at each node the customer may be present with a known probability p. The a priori route has to be determined before it is known which customers will be there or not, information which is revealed afterward. In that sense, the PTSP is a static problem, but it is an SS problem due to the stochasticity of the customers' presence.</p><p>We note that after the a priori route is determined in the PTSP, determining the actual a posteriori route to be traveled is a trivial problem, as nodes with no customers are simply skipped and the sequence of the a priori route is followed. This "a posteriori PTSP" is a problem that is connected to the original PTSP, but it should be realized that it is a different problem. The a posteriori PTSP can be static or dynamic, depending on how information on which customers are present is revealed. If such information is revealed for all customers in advance of the actual a posteriori route execution, then this problem is also static (and actually SD). If such information is revealed gradually and concurrently with actual route execution, then the problem is dynamic (of the DS class, on which more later). A similar situation may be the case in other SS problems: the associated a posteriori problem may be dynamic. It is because of this that we have decided to include SS papers in our taxonomy, even though in a strict sense the VRPs examined by them are static.</p><p>Some VRP problems in the SS category are modeled via stochastic programming, chance constrained programming or other formulations that call for the determination of a set of preplanned routes and do not allow for reoptimization. Some of these models incorporate in their objective functions terms that account for possible recourse action in anticipation of possible changes in the route. To the extent that input to these problems is received before the determination of the preplanned routes, these problems are considered as static (SS). However, as in the PTSP, determining the a posteriori routes as a result of the recourse action may be a dynamic VRP, depending on when the dynamic inputs are revealed. Robust optimization approaches typically call for the determination of a set of a priori routes that (hopefully) satisfy a prescribed objective function and do not deviate much in actual route execution.</p><p>Another example of an SS VRP is in Mendoza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[109]</ref>. They consider the so-called multicompartment vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands, that is, designing transportation routes to satisfy the demands of a set of customers for several products that, because of incompatibility constraints, must be loaded in independent vehicle compartments. This is then modeled as a stochastic program with recourse and solved by means of a memetic algorithm.</p><p>Another example is in Côté at al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, who considered a stochastic vehicle routing problem where a discrete probability distribution characterized the two-dimensional size (height and width), as well as the weight of a subset of items to be delivered to customers. Although some item sizes and weights are not known with certainty when the routes are planned, they become known when it is time to load the vehicles, just before their departure. If it happens that not all items can be loaded in a vehicle, the items of one or more customers are put aside which lead to a penalty (or recourse cost). The objective is to minimize the sum of the routing and recourse costs. The problem was modeled as a two-stage stochastic program and solved with the integer L-shaped method.</p><p>A robust VRP was considered by Agra et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, motivated by a maritime transportation problem. Their model only allowed routes that are feasible for all values of the travel times in a predetermined uncertainty polytope. Two formulations for the robust problem were proposed, each based on a different robust approach. The first formulation extended the resource inequalities formulation using adjustable robust optimization. The second formulation generalized a path inequalities formulation to the uncertain context.</p><p>Gounaris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref> studied the robust capacitated vehicle routing problem under demand uncertainty to address the minimum cost delivery of a product to geographically dispersed customers using capacity-constrained vehicles. Contrary to the deterministic version, which assumed that the customer demands for the product are deterministic and known, the robust version modeled the customer demands as random variables, and determined a minimum cost delivery plan that is feasible for all anticipated demand realizations.</p><p>Perhaps at the antipode of SS problems are VRPs that are labeled dynamic and deterministic (DD). The label "deterministic" may be misleading to imply that future inputs are known in advance, which is not the case. A VRP is DD whenever the problem is dynamic (as defined above), but no stochastic information (a probability or probability distribution) about future, dynamically evolving inputs is known. For instance, nothing may be known about the location of a customer until that customer requests service. Or, nothing may be known about the quantity to be demanded until when that information is revealed. The value of these inputs becomes known only when they appear. Below are some examples.</p><p>Psaraftis <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[122]</ref> examined the single-vehicle, many-tomany, immediate-request dial-a-ride problem in a deterministic setting. Part I of the paper focused on the static (SD) case of the problem. Part II extended this approach to solving the equivalent dynamic (DD) case. The procedure was based on dynamic programming and in the DD case was an open-ended sequence of updates, each following every new customer request. The algorithm optimized only over known inputs and did not anticipate future customer requests.</p><p>Ichoua et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref> presented a model based on timedependent travel speeds which satisfy the "first-in-first-out" property (this means that speeds are such that one cannot arrive earlier by departing later). An experimental evaluation of the proposed model was performed in both a static and a dynamic setting, using a parallel tabu search heuristic. It was shown that the time-dependent model provided substantial improvements over a model based on fixed travel times.</p><p>Gendreau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> proposed neighborhood search heuristics to optimize the planned routes of vehicles in a context where new requests, with a pick-up and a delivery location, occur in real-time. Within this framework, new solutions were explored through a neighborhood structure based on ejection chains. Numerical results showed the benefits of these procedures in a real-time context.</p><p>Last but not least, a VRP is labeled dynamic and stochastic (DS), if some probabilistic information is known about the inputs that dynamically evolve, and routes are updated as these inputs evolve in time. For instance, demand at a customer location may be assumed to follow a certain probability distribution. The actual value of the demand is revealed when the vehicle visits the respective customer. Or, customer locations may have a known spatial distribution and the actual location is revealed when the demand for service occurs. Below are some examples of DS problems.</p><p>Ferrucci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> proposed a real-time control approach for DVRPs in which the urgent delivery of goods is important. Without assuming any distribution, stochastic knowledge about future requests was generated using past request information. The generated knowledge was integrated into the transportation process, which was controlled by a tabu search algorithm, to actively guide vehicles to request-likely areas before requests arrive there.</p><p>Thomas and White <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[150]</ref> modeled and analyzed the problem of constructing a minimum expected total cost route from an origin to a destination that anticipates and then responds to service requests, if they occur, while the vehicle is en route. They modeled this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and presented several results associated with the optimal expected cost-to-go function and an optimal policy for route construction. They illustrated the behavior of an optimal policy with several numerical examples and demonstrated the superiority of an optimal anticipatory policy, relative to a route design approach.</p><p>Goodson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref> developed a family of rollout policies based on fixed routes to obtain dynamic solutions to what they called the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand and duration limits. They then tailored the rollout policies by developing a dynamic decomposition scheme that achieved high quality solutions to large problem instances with reasonable computational effort.</p><p>In our survey we found 71 of the 117 reviewed papers falling under the DD label, with an additional 28 belonging to the DS class. We also identified 18 SS papers and 4 papers that examined both SD and DD variants.</p><p>It should be noted that with anticipated rapid technological advances in ICT, Big Data and other technologies (as mentioned in Section 2), in the future the proportion of DD VRPs is expected to further increase vis-à-vis DS and SS VRPs. This is so because such technological advances are expected to increase both the availability and the quality of information on uncertain future inputs. Also, predictive analytics is expected to enhance one's ability to accurately forecast future data. In that sense, problems such as the classical stochastic inventory routing problem in which a vehicle is set out to replenish customer inventories and the level of these inventories is stochastic and virtually unknown until it is revealed only when the vehicle is on site, would make little sense in an age of Big Data and ubiquitous ICT systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Logistical Context</head><p>The second criterion in the taxonomy concerns what we call the "logistical context" of the problem. Logistical context is supposed to provide supplemental information about the nature of the problem, for instance capture whether the problem is a pickup or delivery problem, a combined pickup and delivery problem, a combined routing and location problem, a combined routing and inventory problem, an arc routing problem or is another variant.</p><p>We list the main variants of logistical context below, together with some sample references for each category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Either pickup (P) or delivery (D)</head><p>: P/D. This is a rather broad class of problems that includes subclasses such as problems with only pickups (P) (many-to-one) or only deliveries (D) (one-to-many). The TSP and k-TSP class of problems naturally belong to this class (literally speaking, the TSP is a D-only problem if we are really talking about a person who aims to sell a specific product to a set of potential customers). The Traveling Repairman Problem (TRP) also belongs to this family of problems, even though in a literal sense there may not be a pickup or delivery in a repair visit. From a methodological viewpoint, P-only problems are not very different from D-only problems, and so it makes sense to group them together. Some indicative examples are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Both</head><p>Pickup and Delivery: PD, PD*. This is an equally broad class, that includes one-to-one (paired pickups and deliveries) (PD) and one-to-many-to-one (unpaired pickups and deliveries) (PD*) as subclasses. In the one-toone case, each customer needs to be transported from one pickup node to one destination node, whereas in the one-tomany-to-one case the transportation of a customer is either from the depot to the customer or from the customer to the depot. The Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP) and its variants are special cases of the PD subclass. Some indicative examples are in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> below.</p><p>From our analysis we found that P/D problems constitute the majority of papers surveyed (75 papers), whereas PD papers came second <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. There were also 3 PD* papers. Some of the papers combine routing with other considerations, as described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Routing with Location/Inventory Considerations.</head><p>A number of papers combined routing with location and/or inventory considerations. For instance, Verma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[153]</ref> looked at telemetry units that can be used to track inventory levels at customers, helping suppliers get a better idea of when their customers require deliveries. In the paper, the question of where to place a limited number of these units was considered. The model considered several different realizations of when these customers would need deliveries and evaluated the cost of routing these customers in combination with those customers who do not have telemetry. Among other work, Rezaei-Malek and Tavakkoli-Moghaddam <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[131]</ref> presented a biobjective mixed-integer mathematical model for humanitarian relief logistics operations planning. The model determined optimal policies including location of warehouses, quantity of emergency relief items that should be held at each warehouse and distribution plan to provide an emergency response prepositioning strategy for disasters by considering two objectives: minimizing the average response time and minimizing the total operational cost including the fixed cost of establishing warehouses, the holding cost of unused supplies and the penalty cost of unsatisfied demand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.">Routing with Queueing Considerations.</head><p>As noted in Psaraftis <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[124]</ref>, one among the several aspects that may differentiate dynamic VRPs from their static counterparts is that queueing considerations may become important. The work of Bertsimas and van Ryzin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> on the Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem (DTRP) was pioneering in that regard. Even though the DTRP is a P/D (DS) problem, in these papers the authors analyzed various versions of a DTRP on the Euclidean plane, and modeled these from a queueing system perspective, by analyzing system performance for several scenarios and routing policies. They also analyzed the asymptotic behavior of several routing/queueing policies for both the single vehicle and multiple vehicle cases, under a variety of scenarios as regards parameters such as vehicle capacity.</p><p>It should also be noted that the DTRP is also connected to a location problem, as the "stochastic queue median" policy, that is, relocating the vehicle to the area's median location was shown to be optimal under a "light traffic" scenario.</p><p>Another DTRP paper with queueing considerations is by Huang and Sengupta <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref>. They established a necessary and sufficient condition for stability under the class of "polling-sequencing" policies satisfying unlimited-polling and economy of scale. Some of the policies were proven to be optimal for expected system time under light and heavy loads.</p><p>Another related work (albeit peripherally) was that of Psaraftis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[123]</ref> in the context of routing and scheduling for the US Military Sealift Command in a mobilization situation. This is a PD multiple ship problem, solved by a "rolling horizon" heuristic and of which the nonlinear objective function incorporates (among other terms dealing with ship utilization, cargo to ship assignment disutility and delivery delay disutility) also a term that accounts for possible queueing in ports.</p><p>Last but not least, we note the paper by Sheridan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[138]</ref> as belonging to the same class. We comment on the latter paper in Section 3.11.2 in the context of its solution approach (nearest neighbor).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5.">Arc Routing.</head><p>Here, we note the paper by Tagmouti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[142]</ref>, who described a dynamic capacitated arc routing problem motivated from winter gritting applications. In this problem, the service cost on each arc was assumed a piecewise linear function of the time of beginning of service. This function also exhibits an optimal time interval where the service cost is minimal. A variable neighborhood descent heuristic, initially developed for the static version of the problem, where all service cost functions are known in advance and do not change thereafter, was adapted to this dynamic variant.</p><p>It should be finally mentioned that we did not find any papers in which the DVRP is linked to production logistics. This can be an area for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Transportation Mode</head><p>This criterion is complementary to the logistical context one and concerns the transportation mode of the vehicle. The following modes are relevant:</p><p>Road: This is by far the most dominant mode among the reviewed papers, with some 106 papers defined on a road setting. Papers cover a wide variety of cases, including (some related references are shown indicatively):</p><p>Bus or mini-bus services (Wen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[154]</ref>) Courier services (Attanasio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Ghiani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>) City logistics (Branchini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>) Grocery logistics (Campbell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>) Milk delivery services (Du et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>) Ambulance logistics (Gendreau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>) Automated guided vehicles logistics (Gan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>)</p><p>Maritime: Even though the literature of ship routing and scheduling problems has grown considerably over the years, most of the papers study static scenarios and not much exists for dynamic scenarios. In our taxonomy we found 3 "dynamic" references, Agra et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Colmant and van Vuuren <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and Psaraftis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[123]</ref>. The Agra et al. and the Psaraftis et al. references concern industrial shipping and military logistics (respectively) and were commented on in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.4 of this article (respectively). The Colmant and van Vuuren paper concerns a law enforcement scenario which can be formulated as a special kind of DVRP, in which the depot represents the base from whence maritime law enforcement resources (MLERs) are dispatched, the fleet of vehicles represents the fleet of MLERs at the disposal of the coastal nation and the customers represent the events tracked at sea.</p><p>Air: One reference was identified and that concerns air taxi service in Norway. In Fagerholt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, a methodology and simulation study supporting decisions such as determining the required number of aircraft for a company planning to establish an air taxi service was developed. The methodology was based on a module simulating incoming bookings, built around a heuristic for solving the underlying dial-a-flight problem.</p><p>Walking: Last but not least, in one of the references <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> the transportation mode was the human pair of legs. This reference is among those reviewed in the next section in the context of its objective function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Objective Function</head><p>A major criterion in the taxonomy concerns the objective function of the problem. According to Psaraftis <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[124]</ref>, several factors may distinguish a DVRP from its static counterpart. Among them, we single out the following two, which are in fact related:</p><p>Objective function may be different. Near-term events are more important.</p><p>In a DVRP, one would expect to see a more frequent use of "throughput" or "per unit time" objectives, such as average per unit time serviced customers, average per unit time cost, average demand rejections per unit time, or similar. Yet, and with some exceptions, most of the objectives encountered in the set of reviewed papers are identical or quasi-identical to traditional static objectives. These exceptions (and they are not very frequent) include objectives such as maximum probability of serving new customers, or maximum number of serviced customers, as described above. Below we (indicatively) list some related papers.</p><p>Bent and van Hentenryck <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> considered the goal to maximize the number of serviced customers in a dynamic multiple vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic customers. They presented a multiple scenario approach (MSA) that continuously generated routing plans for scenarios including known and future requests. Decisions during execution used a distinguished plan chosen, at each decision, by a consensus function. The approach was evaluated on vehicle routing problems adapted from the Solomon benchmarks with a degree of dynamism varying between 30% and 80%.</p><p>We note here that the maximum number of serviced customers very much depends on the existence and nature of time constraints (see Section 3.6) and on whether or not it is permitted to reject customers (see Section 3.8). For instance, the existence of hard time windows would usually imply that some customers may be allowed to be rejected, and if this is so the maximum number of serviced customers may be lower vis-à-vis the case in which time windows are soft and customers cannot be rejected.</p><p>Branke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> considered a DVRP where one additional customer arrives at an unknown location when the vehicles are already under way. They considered the objective to maximize the probability that this additional customer can be integrated into one of the otherwise fixed tours without violating time constraints. This was achieved by letting the vehicles wait at suitable locations during their tours, thus influencing the position of the vehicles at the time when the new customer arrives. Several deterministic waiting strategies and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to optimize the waiting strategy were proposed and compared empirically. It was demonstrated that a proper waiting strategy can significantly increase the probability of being able to service the additional customer, at the same time reducing the average detour to serve that customer.</p><p>Fiegl and Pontow <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> developed an algorithm for scheduling pick-up and delivery tasks in hospitals. The average weighted flow time was defined as the objective function that corresponds to a measure for the task throughput. An optimized scheduling for all types of transportation tasks occurring in a hospital accelerates medical procedures, and reduces the patient's waiting time and costs. Techniques from classical scheduling theory and graph theory were used. A similar "flow time" type of objective was used in Bertsimas and van Ryzin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> in the context of the DTRP.</p><p>Pureza and Laporte <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[128]</ref> aimed at minimizing the number of rejected customers. More on this article is in Section 3.11.6 in the context of its solution approach.</p><p>Coming now to the other factor that may distinguish a DVRP from its static counterpart, the importance of nearterm events, these are indeed more important events because the further away an event is time-wise, the less influential it is in the immediate decision process because of the other events that are likely occur in between. However, we have not encountered in the literature objective functions that place more emphasis on near-term events. One might consider rolling horizon schemes as an exception in that they only consider events within the rolling horizon and ignore everything beyond that. But even for these schemes all events within the rolling horizon receive equal weight in the objective function.</p><p>Over and above papers examining objective functions that are in a sense closer to a dynamic scenario, we have observed that most of the papers consider objective functions that are closer or identical to static objectives. These include (sample references are shown in parentheses): a. To be minimized Route cost <ref type="bibr">[Fabri and</ref>  Among all objectives seen in the literature, the most popular are travel time, route distance, route cost, and customer dissatisfaction.</p><p>There are finally several references with weighted or multiple objectives (for instance Attanasio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, Haghani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref>, Psaraftis <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[122]</ref>, Respen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">130]</ref>, Wohlgemuth <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[161]</ref>), and even one that only checks the feasibility of a DVRP route <ref type="bibr">(Berbeglia [15]</ref>).</p><p>So in terms of problem objectives, and with some few exceptions that only seem to confirm the rule, we see pretty much a replica of the static case. We shall further comment on this issue in Section 4.3 where we discuss alternative objective functions in the context of further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Fleet Size</head><p>Another criterion concerns the number of available vehicles. Three types of fleet scenarios are commonly seen in the literature:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single vehicle Multiple and limited number Multiple and sufficiently large number (or infinite)</head><p>Most of the papers we have reviewed belong to the multiple and limited number of vehicles category, reflecting the fact that in a dynamic setting the dispatcher may not have instant access to backup vehicles and vehicle resources are naturally finite. However, in a few papers (for instance Schilde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133]</ref>, Elhassania et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[168]</ref>, and Barkaoui and Gendreau <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>), a sufficiently large number of vehicles is assumed to be available for dispatching, which is essentially equivalent to assuming an infinite number of vehicles. Only a few papers refer to the single vehicle case (for instance Psaraftis <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[122]</ref>, Bertsimas and van Ryzin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Larsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[97]</ref>, and Ghiani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Time Constraints</head><p>This criterion concerns the type of time constraint of the request. The following possibilities exist (sample references are shown in parentheses):</p><p>No time constraints (Branke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and Christiansen and Lysgaard <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>). A hard time window (Kergosien et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref>, Yan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[159]</ref>). A soft time window (Ferrucci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, Barkaoui and Gendreau <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Lorini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[104]</ref>). Other types of time constraints (see below).</p><p>In practice, a dynamic scenario typically implies constraints with a soft time window or no time window, because it is difficult to promise a hard time window unless the problem formulation allows for an infinite vehicle number (as per Section 3.5), or for the rejection of customer requests (as per Section 3.8). In that sense, there is an interdependency among these criteria, as the combination of hard time windows, no rejection possibility and a finite number of vehicles may render problem instances infeasible and, as such, is not realistic. Also, denying service to customers is less realistic than soft time windows and an infinite vehicle number is not realistic at all.</p><p>A soft time window can be either one-side soft (see for instance Ichoua et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref>, Kergosien et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref> and Lorini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[104]</ref>) or two-side soft (Haghani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref> and Beaudry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). In the former case, earliness or tardiness, depending on which side of the time window is soft, is penalized in the objective function, whereas in the latter case, both are penalized.</p><p>Other types of time constraints have also been considered mainly for the control or improvement of service quality. For instance, in a courier application, different classes of customers have different time windows, either hard or onesided soft (Attanasio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). In Du et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, mixed time windows are used, where the inner time window is soft and the outer time window is hard. In Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[101]</ref> and in Ghannadpour et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61]</ref>, service level dependent time windows are considered either to maintain a certain level of service quality or to maximize the service satisfaction.</p><p>Last but not least, in some papers (for instance Attanasio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and Berbeglia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) maximum ride time constraints are considered. Alternatively, maximum route length or duration are considered (see for instance Erera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and Ninikas and Minis <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[118]</ref>).</p><p>Of the 117 papers surveyed, some 50 had no time constraints of any kind, whereas 39 had hard time windows and 20 had soft time windows. Some 43 had maximum ride time constraints and 43 had maximum route length or duration constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Vehicle capacity constraints</head><p>Similar to the static case, both capacitated (Mendoza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[110]</ref>, Schilde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133]</ref>, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[165]</ref>) and uncapacitated scenarios (Fink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>, Gendreau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>, Ichoua et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>) are considered in a dynamic context. In some applications, for instance courier delivery, the volume/weight of the goods is relatively small as compared to vehicle capacity. Vehicle capacity can therefore be regarded as infinite, meaning that the vehicle can, for all practical purposes, serve as many customers as necessary. In most other applications, a vehicle capacity constraint is imposed.</p><p>In our survey we found some 70% of the papers to incorporate vehicle capacity constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8">Ability to Reject Customers</head><p>This criterion concerns whether it is allowed to reject customers. Customer rejection is more often seen in a dynamic VRP than in a static VRP, especially when vehicle resources are limited, or hard time windows exist. Even though the rejection of customers is usually undesirable, it may be a natural consequence of a hard time window requirement coupled with a limited number of vehicles or a vehicle capacity constraint. So this criterion is connected to the time constraint criterion, in the sense that having both a hard time window and not allowing rejection of customer requests would make little sense as the problem may be rendered infeasible.</p><p>In that context, some papers (for instance Bent and van Hentenryck <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and Goel and Gruhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>) allow for this possibility whereas some others (for instance Branchini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Cheung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and Ferrucci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>) do not.</p><p>We found that about 70% of the papers in the taxonomy do not allow for the rejection of customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.">Nature of Dynamic Element</head><p>The nature the dynamic element of a DVRP may be manifested in several forms, including the following (sample references are shown):</p><p>Dynamic requests, including requests cancellations and changes in customers locations and/or demands (Campbell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Cheung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Ferrucci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>). Dynamic travel and/or service times (Taniguchi and Shimamoto <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[143]</ref>, Tagmouti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[142]</ref>). Dynamic vehicle availability or lack thereof (vehicle breakdowns) (Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">99]</ref>, Mu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[117]</ref>). Some 80% of the problems in the taxonomy involve the dynamic appearance of customers, some 10% involve dynamic travel times and some 3% consider vehicle breakdowns. In our search we were not able to find papers handling other types of dynamic events such as cargo damages or accidents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.10.">Nature of Stochasticity (if any)</head><p>This criterion is similar to the previous one and concerns the nature of stochasticity in case we are dealing with a DS or SS problem. It is not applicable to DD problems. It may involve the following aspects (again sample references are shown):</p><p>Stochastic customer location (Flatberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, Ferrucci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, Yan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[159]</ref>) Stochastic demand size <ref type="bibr">(Novoa [167]</ref>, Ghiani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>, Mendoza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[110]</ref>) Stochastic travel time (Xiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[157]</ref>, Pureza and Laporte <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[128]</ref>)</p><p>In some 50% of the DS /SS papers, customer location is the main stochastic element, followed by some 35% where demand size is the main stochastic variable and some 18% of the papers with travel time being the main element of stochasticity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.">Solution Methods</head><p>It is known that a broad variety of solution methods has been developed and used for static VRPs. Equally broad is the spectrum of possible solution methods for dynamic VRPs. Given that fast solution times are essential, most of the approaches are heuristic. In the following, we review what we believe are the main methods that appear in the surveyed papers, indicatively also listing some sample references in the process. Methods are used either alone or in combination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.1.">Tabu search (TS) Including Parallel TS.</head><p>Gendreau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> described a DVRP, motivated from courier service applications, where customer requests with soft time windows must be dispatched in real time to a fleet of vehicles in movement. A tabu search heuristic, initially designed for the static version of the problem, was adapted to the dynamic case and implemented on a parallel platform to increase the computational effort. Numerical results were reported using different request arrival rates, and comparisons are established with other heuristic methods.</p><p>Inspired by the above paper, Kergosien et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref> studied the transportation of patients in the hospital complex of the city of Tours (France). Some demands are known in advance and the others arise dynamically. Each demand requires a specific type of vehicle and a vehicle can transport only one person at a time. The demands can be subcontracted to a private company which implies high cost. The authors proposed a tabu search algorithm and evaluated computational experiments on a real-life instance and on randomly generated instances.</p><p>Attanasio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> studied the Dial-a-Ride problem (DARP), where users specify transportation requests between origins and destinations to be served by vehicles. In the dynamic DARP, requests are received throughout the day and the primary objective is to accept as many requests as possible while satisfying operational constraints. The article described and compared a number of parallel implementations of a tabu search heuristic previously developed for the static DARP. Computational results showed that the proposed algorithms are able to satisfy a high percentage of user requests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.2.">Various Neighborhood Search (NS) approaches, including Adaptive NS, Variable NS, Large NS, etc.</head><p>Gendreau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> proposed neighborhood search heuristics to optimize the planned routes of vehicles in a context where new requests, with a pick-up and a delivery location, occur in real-time. Within this framework, new solutions were explored through a neighborhood structure based on ejection chains. Numerical results showed the benefits of these procedures in a real-time context. The impact of a master-slave parallelization scheme, using an increasing number of processors, was also investigated.</p><p>Azi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> considered a vehicle routing problem where each vehicle performs delivery operations over multiple routes during its workday and where new customer requests occur dynamically. The proposed methodology for addressing the problem was based on an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic, previously developed for the static version of the problem. In the dynamic case, multiple possible scenarios for the occurrence of future requests were considered to decide about the opportunity to include a new request into the current solution.</p><p>Schilde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[133]</ref> considered the effect of exploiting statistical information available about historical accidents, using stochastic solution approaches for the dynamic dial-a-ride problem (dynamic DARP). The authors proposed two pairs of metaheuristic solution approaches, each consisting of a deterministic method (average time-dependent travel speeds for planning) and its corresponding stochastic version (exploiting stochastic information while planning). The results, using test instances with up to 762 requests based on a real world road network, showed that in certain conditions, exploiting stochastic information about travel speeds leads to significant improvements over deterministic approaches. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> examined grocery delivery and other home delivery problems that pose logistical challenges due to the unpredictability of demand coupled with strict delivery windows and low profit margin products. They proposed algorithms based on insertion heuristics, in which it is decided which deliveries to accept or reject as well as the time slot for the accepted deliveries so as to maximize expected profits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.3.">Insertion Methods. Campbell and Savelsbergh</head><p>Beaudry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> analyzed and solved a patient transportation problem arising in large hospitals. Requests were assumed to arrive in a dynamic fashion. The problem under study included several complicating constraints, specific to a hospital context. An insertion scheme was used to generate a feasible solution, which was improved in the second phase with a tabu search algorithm.</p><p>In the same spirit, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">99]</ref> examined the case where the vehicle breaks down on a scheduled trip, with one or more vehicles needed to be rescheduled to serve that trip and other service trips originally scheduled for the disabled vehicle. Lagrangian relaxation based insertion heuristics were developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.4.">Nearest Neighbor (NN). Sheridan et al. [138]</head><p>proposed a dynamic nearest neighbor (DNN) policy for operating a fleet of vehicles to serve customers who place calls in a Euclidean service area according to a Poisson process. Each vehicle serves one customer at a time, who has a distinct origin and destination independently and uniformly distributed within the service area. The DNN policy is a refined version of the static nearest neighbor (NN) policy that is well known to perform suboptimally when the frequency of customer requests is high. Simulations showed the DNN policy to be tangibly superior to the first-come first-served (FCFS) and NN policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.5.">Column Generation (CG).</head><p>Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> considered a DVRP with hard time windows, in which a set of customer orders arrives randomly over time to be picked up within their time windows. The objective is to minimize the sum of the total distance of the routes used to cover all the orders. They proposed a column-generation-based approach for the problem. The approach generates single-vehicle trips (i.e., columns) over time in a real-time fashion by utilizing existing columns, and solves at each decision epoch a setpartitioning-type formulation of the static problem consisting of the columns generated up to this time point.</p><p>Christiansen and Lysgaard <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> introduced a new exact algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands. This was formulated as a set partitioning problem and it was shown that the associated column generation subproblem could be solved using a dynamic programming scheme.</p><p>3.11.6. Genetic Algorithms (GA). Taniguchi and Shimamoto <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[143]</ref> used genetic algorithms for a DVRP that incorporated real time information using variable travel times. Dynamic traffic simulation was used to update the travel times. Results indicated that the total cost decreased by implementing the DVRP with real time information based on variable travel times as compared with that of a forecast model.</p><p>Barkaoui and Gendreau <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> introduced an adaptive evolutionary approach that used a genetic algorithm for the DVRP with time windows. The authors compared the adaptive version of a hybrid genetic algorithm with the nonadaptive one with respect to the robustness and the quality of the generated solutions. The results showed the ability to produce solutions that were superior to hand-tuning and to other adaptive methods with respect to performance sensitivity and robustness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.7.">Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Dan et al.</head><p>[39] studied the emergency materials dispatch problem. They modeled this problem into a series of static problems evolving in time. They considered a multiobjective model and designed an ant colony optimization algorithm to solve the problem. A numerical example was demonstrated the validity and feasibility of the proposed model and algorithm.</p><p>Similarly, Elhassania et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[168]</ref> decomposed the DVRP into a series of static VRPs and then used a hybridization obtained by combining an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm with a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm. The computational experiments were applied to 22 benchmarks instances with up to 385 customers and the effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated by comparing the computational results with those earlier presented in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.8.">Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).</head><p>Khouadjia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref> considered a DVRP and used methods based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) paradigms. The performance of both approaches was evaluated using a new set of benchmarks as well as existing benchmarks in the literature.</p><p>Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[161]</ref> studied the multiobjective distribution problem with time windows for online shopping express logistics as an extension of the VRP with time windows. To solve this problem, they designed a modified particle swarm PSO which can enhance the quality of the particle evolution and the speed of the original algorithm.</p><p>3.11.9. Waiting-Relocation Strategies. By the term "waiting strategies" one means that under some circumstances it may make sense for the vehicles to wait before the assignment to customers is made. For instance, Pureza and Laporte <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[128]</ref> investigated the impact of two strategies for dynamic pickup and delivery problems on the quality of solutions produced by insertion heuristics: (a) a waiting strategy that delays the final assignment of vehicles to their next destination and (b) a request buffering strategy that postpones the assignment of some non-urgent new requests to the next route planning. These strategies were tested in a constructivedeconstructive heuristic for a dynamic pickup and delivery problem with hard time windows and random travel times. The work of Branke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, already discussed in Section 3.4, also belongs to the same class of methods.</p><p>Alternatively, it may make sense for the vehicles to relocate to appropriately defined locations. An example is in Larsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[97]</ref>, who examined the TSP with time windows for various degrees of dynamism. They sought to minimize lateness and examined the impact of this criterion choice on the distance traveled and proposed a real-time solution method that requires the vehicle, when idle, to wait at the current customer location until it can service another customer without being early. In addition, they developed several enhanced versions of this method that might relocate the vehicle at a location different from that of the current customer based on a priori information on future requests.</p><p>In Ichoua et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>, dummy customers, representing forecasted requests, were made part of the problem input so as to construct provisional routes with a good coverage of the territory. This strategy was assessed through computational experiments performed in a simulated environment. A similar approach was followed in Ghiani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>: whenever the vehicle is temporarily idle, one option is to relocate it in anticipation of future demands. An optimal policy through a Markov decision process was determined and both lower and upper bounds on the optimal policy cost were developed.</p><p>More on Markov decision processes is in Section 3.11.10 that follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.10.">Markov Decision</head><p>Processes. An additional number of papers model DVRPs as Markov decision processes. For instance, Thomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[149]</ref> considered a dynamic and stochastic routing problem in which information about customer locations and probabilistic information about future service requests was used to maximize the expected number of customers served by a single uncapacitated vehicle. The problem was modeled as a Markov decision process and analytical results on the structure of the optimal policy were derived. Using the analytical results, he proposed a real-time heuristic and demonstrated its effectiveness compared with a series of other heuristics.</p><p>In the same vein, Secomandi and Margot <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[137]</ref> considered the vehicle-routing problem with stochastic demands. They considered a finite-horizon Markov decision process formulation for the single-vehicle case and established a partial characterization of the optimal policy. They also proposed a heuristic solution methodology named partial reoptimization, based on the idea of restricting attention to a subset of all the possible states and computing an optimal policy on this restricted set of states. They discussed two families of computationally efficient partial reoptimization heuristics and illustrated their performance on a set of instances with up to and including 100 customers.</p><p>3.11.11. Dynamic Programming (DP)-Based Approaches. These include adaptive DP, approximate DP and neuro-DP.</p><p>Secomandi <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[135]</ref> considered a single vehicle DVRP where customers' demands are uncertain. The objective was to minimize the expected distance traveled to serve all customers' demands. The paper used neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) in providing approximate solutions to the problem and compared the performance of two NDP algorithms: optimistic approximate policy iteration and a rollout policy, a result being that the former improved the performance of a nearest-neighbor policy by 2.3%, and that the computational results indicate that the rollout policy generates higher quality solutions.</p><p>Godfrey and Powell <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref> considered a stochastic version of a dynamic resource allocation problem. In this setting, reusable resources must be assigned to tasks that arise randomly over time. They solved the problem using an adaptive dynamic programming algorithm that used nonlinear functional approximations that give the value of resources in the future. The functional approximations were piecewise linear and provided integer solutions. They showed that the approximations provided near-optimal solutions to deterministic problems and solutions that significantly outperform deterministic rolling-horizon methods on stochastic problems.</p><p>Novoa and Storer <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[119]</ref> examined approximate dynamic programming algorithms for the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands. The methods extended the roll-out algorithm by implementing different base sequences (i.e., a priori solutions), look-ahead policies, and pruning schemes. The paper also considered computing the cost-to-go with Monte Carlo simulation in addition to direct approaches. The best new method found was a two-step look ahead rollout started with a stochastic base sequence, with a routing cost about 4.8% less than the one-step rollout algorithm started with a deterministic sequence. Results also showed that Monte Carlo cost-to-go estimation reduced computation time by 65% in large instances with little or no loss in solution quality.</p><p>3.11.12. Queueing-Polling Strategies. A polling system is a system of multiple queues accessed by a single server in cyclic order (see Takagi <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[145]</ref>). The paper by Huang and Sengupta <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref>, already mentioned in Section 3.2.4 in the context of the DTRP, adopts a polling strategy approach. The papers of Bertsimas and van Ryzin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> (see again Section 3.2.4), also take a queueing-theoretic approach, again in the context of the DTRP. The sheer number of possible approaches makes a statistical representation of the reviewed papers not very meaningful. However, and very much like the discussion of the objective function, a pertinent question is whether any of the above solution methods can be characterized as more "dynamic," that is, exhibit a distinct methodological difference vis-à-vis static approaches.</p><p>In our opinion, 4 of the 12 methodological classes examined (and specifically those in Sections 3.11.9 to 3.11.12) can be tagged this label. The rest, which actually represent the majority of papers, are adaptations, either straightforward or more intricate, of static approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION AND THE WAY AHEAD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Statistics vs Importance</head><p>We believe that our paper supports the general conclusion that DVRP research has grown substantially in the last 3-4 decades, and provides evidence of the specific areas that researchers in this class of problems have engaged in. Growth in the related literature has been strongest after 2000, with current growth continuing to be very strong.</p><p>It should be clarified that the statistics listed in several instances in this article serve no other purpose than to report the state of the art in this area, as viewed via the particular prism of this article, and not necessarily imply conclusions on importance. Thus, there is certainly no implication that if a majority of the papers deal with objective function X or method Y, then X or Y are considered more important. Making any statement on importance is difficult or impossible because it involves a high degree of subjectivity. Something along these lines would also be unfair, as what may have been considered important in 1980 or 1990 may not be any more 10, 20, or 30 years later. The opposite may also be the case: the importance of a particular paper may only be recognized many years after publication.</p><p>At the same time, we do believe that this article may conceivably help identifying research trends and possibly gaps that need to be closed. In our (subjective) opinion, methodological approaches such as those listed in Sections 3.11.9-3.11.12, even though belonging to the outliers set in terms of statistics, are of more interest, by virtue of being sufficiently different from adaptations of static approaches, which constitute the majority of work in this area. We believe that if dynamic vehicle routing is to be established as a class of problems with a distinct methodological base, more should be done in these areas. This is not to diminish the value of adaptations of static approaches, as many of the papers reviewed have shown that they can be quite effective in a dynamic environment.</p><p>Related to the above is that our taxonomy has shown that there are topics and subjects which we have not seen very much of in the literature. These may be ripe for future research for the DVRP. They include the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Walk Before Attempting to Run</head><p>We have seen that the DVRP literature over the last few decades is full of approaches that have tackled ever more complex variants of DVRPs. Yet, to our knowledge, what seems to be the simplest variant of these problems remains unresolved. This is the Dynamic TSP (DTSP), introduced in Psaraftis <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[124]</ref>. The DTSP is a dynamic and stochastic (DS) problem. It is defined on a given graph, with known inter-node transit times, and in which customer demands arrive at each node according to a Poisson process of mean arrival rate λ. These demands are to be serviced by a salesman who spends a fixed time of t 0 to service each demand. If the salesman is at node 1 at time 0, what should his optimal policy be? Optimal may be with respect to either the average number of demands serviced per unit time or with respect to the average expected time, over all demands, from the appearance of a demand until its service is completed. One could also consider other variants of the DTSP, such as for instance a version in which no probabilistic information on future demands is known (the DD version), or even a version in which probabilistic information is updated in a Bayesian fashion.</p><p>To our knowledge, the only work that is related to this apparently simple, yet still unresolved problem regards its Euclidean plane counterpart, and is due to Bertsimas and van Ryzin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in the context of the single vehicle DTRP. As already noted earlier, in the Euclidean version points were assumed to be randomly distributed on the Euclidean plane and a queueing theoretic approach was taken to investigate various policies, some of which were proven to be asymptotically optimal. However, not much is known about solutions for the version in which the problem is defined on a given graph. One can make a plausible conjecture that it may have similar properties with that of the Euclidean version. But how can one solve it exactly, or even what might be a good heuristic for it, are to the best of our knowledge still unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Alternative Objective Functions</head><p>As mentioned earlier, most objectives examined in the literature are similar to static objectives. Thus it would be nice to focus on objectives closer to a dynamic setting. These include infinite horizon objectives, in the "stochastic optimal control" sense, and are mostly relevant for stochastic and dynamic problems (SD). Examples are average per unit time served customers, average per unit time cost, average demand rejections per unit time, and so forth. The use of such objectives in DVRPs is, as it seems, rather scant. Several models use the rolling horizon concept, where the problem is optimized over inputs within a prescribed (rolling) horizon (see for instance Haghani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[169]</ref>).</p><p>One might also consider objective functions that put more weight into near-term events as opposed to those that may occur later. Discounted objectives, that is, those that place diminishing emphasis into later events, are very common in infinite horizon stochastic optimal control problems and have applications in many settings (see, for instance, Bertsekas <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). Yet, we have not seen such a different weighting scheme in the DVRP papers that we have reviewed. All events, or at least those within the rolling time horizon under consideration, if one exists, are being treated equally, even though near term events are more important.</p><p>We have also observed that none of the objectives in our taxonomy explicitly pertains to environmental considerations, for instance minimize vehicle emissions. This is discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Vehicle Speed and Environmental Considerations-Green DVRPs</head><p>One could imagine that an important option in a dynamic setting is to adjust vehicle speed so as to cope with dynamic demand and thus influence the objective function. Obviously adjusting vehicle speed would have cost implications and may in general entail additional constraints (such as for instance speed limits). It would also have environmental implications, as vehicle emissions depend on fuel burned which is a function of speed. Including the speed knob as an option may increase flexibility in the overall decision process in a dynamic setting, particularly if adding vehicles or rejecting customer requests is an undesirable or infeasible option. Vehicle speed optimization is seen in some VRPs with environmental considerations such as the Pollution Routing Problem, also known as the green VRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and in some maritime logistics problems (Psaraftis and Kontovas, <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[126]</ref>). However, these problems are typically in a static setting. Magirou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[105]</ref> treat ship speed in a dynamic setting, but include no routing considerations. In the recent book of Psaraftis <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[127]</ref> on green transportation logistics, the tradeoffs between economic and environmental performance of the logistical supply chain are discussed. Even though the green VRP is covered (Bektaş et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), no green DVRP is examined. In a chapter of that book, Geiger <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref> discusses the role of ICT in green freight logistics, including the concept of dynamic speed limits depending on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, but again no routing considerations are included. In short, we are aware of no DVRPs where vehicle speed is a decision variable or the objective function includes environmental terms.</p><p>Future research in this area would evaluate the tradeoffs between traditional and environmental criteria, as these can be applied in a dynamic setting. Knobs such as dynamic congestion pricing that could influence route choice or speed may be very relevant in that regard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">More Explicit Linkages of the Methodology to Technological Advances</head><p>In most of the papers that we have reviewed, linkages between methodology and technology seem to be elusive or ill-defined. Granted, advances in computing speed and data storage make DVRP calculations faster and easier to execute (with the limitations described in Section 2). However, and with some exceptions (see for instance papers by Cheung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and by Gomes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref> that refer to specific mobile telephony applications, the papers that exploit parallel computation, as per Section 3.11.1 and Talbi and Hasle <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[146]</ref> on the use of GPU in metaheuristics), we have seen a general lack of connection between methodology and technology, or a discussion of if and how the latter has, or may have influenced the former.</p><p>There are many opportunities for future research in related topics in our opinion. Areas include but are not limited to:</p><p>Big Data: As mentioned in Section 2, the use of Big Data in logistics is indeed an emerging topic. More analysis is necessary on how to better structure and use the data. Until now, companies have been using the data to expost confirm the decision they have taken and evaluate their decisions. Companies have to adjust to a new mindset mainly focusing on prediction. The large amount of data can be used to predict various inputs to DVRP models such as demand and travel time. Predictive analytics, another emerging field of OR, encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from modeling, machine learning, and data mining that analyze real-time and historical facts to make predictions about future, or otherwise unknown, events. Thus, the advances in the fields of big data and predictive analytics can open up new horizons and contribute to more efficient real-time route optimization.</p><p>Electric vehicle routing: Linde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[102]</ref> examined the routing of electric vehicles in the city of Copenhagen, in conjunction with optimal location of charging stations. But no dynamic scenarios were considered. A dynamic setting was considered in Adler and Mirchandani <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> in conjunction with optimal choice of battery replacement location. But theirs was more of an optimal path problem than a VRP. One would expect research in this area to grow, and also place more emphasis on environmental considerations.</p><p>Drone and unmanned vehicle logistics: Complementary to electric vehicles, technologies such as drones and unmanned vehicles for civilian use are likely to be seen in the years ahead, their uptake of course being uncertain and dependent on market and legal developments. With widespread use of wireless sensor-based and ICT solutions built-into these vehicles and into related infrastructure, the question is, how would this influence methods for efficient routing and fleet management in a dynamic setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Analysis of Worst Case or Average Case Performance of Heuristics</head><p>Even though most approaches for the DVRP are heuristic, much absent from the literature is the analysis of their worst case performance, that is, what is the maximum that a given heuristic algorithm may deviate from the theoretical optimum. In that sense, what has been a classical and essential ingredient of the analysis of static VRP heuristics is for all practical purposes not very present in the DVRP literature.</p><p>To be fair to researchers over the last 3 or 4 decades, the above may come as no surprise, given that even what constitutes an optimal, or exact, DVRP algorithm may be not very well defined. In the general (mostly computer science) literature of dynamic, or "online" optimization problems, it is customary to compare the performance of an on-line algorithm to that of an "offline" optimal (exact) counterpart (see, for instance, Sleator and Tarjan <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[141]</ref> and Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref>). The offline exact algorithm knows all inputs in advance, and is thus able to take advantage of such information to produce an optimal solution. The online algorithm, conversely, is unable to do the same as these inputs are made known to it only gradually. The gradual appearance of inputs may actually make the online algorithm look not very smart, as its solutions may look poor just by the appearance of additional inputs that arrive later. Worst case performance is then defined in terms of how much worse an algorithm A with dynamically revealed information could do as compared with an optimal algorithm with full information available. Algorithm A is then "optimal" if its worst case performance is as favorable as possible.</p><p>Karp <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref> presented some examples to explore an array of online problems in several settings, including paging problems in computer systems, list processing in data structures, multi-processor scheduling, interval coloring, the k-server problem, and others. He also discussed the advantages of randomized algorithms over deterministic ones.</p><p>To our knowledge, little of this nature has yet been performed for DVRPs. Some exceptions are:</p><p>1. In a robotics dynamic setting, Savla et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[132]</ref> proposed an algorithm with performance within a constant factor of the optimum for the worst-case point sets. 2. Fink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref> developed new lower bounds for the k-TSP on a plane, the k-TRP on a real line and the k-DARP using randomized strategies. 3. Wen at al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[154]</ref> studied the on-line TSP with deadlines and provided some insights by giving lower bounds for the competitive ratios, and quantifying the influence of advanced information. 4. Jaillet and Lu <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref> consider on-line versions of the TSP on metric spaces for which requests to visit points are not mandatory and provide worst case ratios for a variety of scenarios of these problems.</p><p>A parallel direction concerns the average case performance of DVRP algorithms, which is how much they would deviate from the optimum on an average, or probabilistic basis. But here the picture is very similar: little on this subject can be found in the DVRP literature. The closest is perhaps the work of Gendreau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> and of Tagmouti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[142]</ref>, as regards the value of off-line versus online information. Asymptotic analyses of competitive ratios were presented in Jaillet and Wagner <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">85]</ref> and Jaillet and Lu <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref>.</p><p>It is hoped that this article will stimulate further research in the DVRP area, by tackling some of the above problems. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIG. 1.
