<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>This note considers the robust distributed model predictive control (MPC) problem of large-scale dynamically decoupled continuous-time nonlinear systems. It is motivated by application scenarios where a group of dynamically decoupled agents need to perform a cooperative task or achieve some coordination through a distributed manner. In such scenarios, the cooperation or coordination can be achieved through a centralized cost function. Yet, on the one hand, the implementation of the centralized MPC (such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) might be hindered due to its computational inefficiency and/or the unavailability of a centralized control structure; on the other hand, the decentralized MPC may result in poor performance because of ignoring couplings among agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Therefore, the distributed MPC is adopted to approximate the centralized objective by designing a local MPC associated with each agent and exchanging information among agents. This type of study finds many practical applications such as multi-vehicle formation control and cooperative tracking control <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In the literature on distributed MPC, some promising results have been reported for large-scale linear systems, nonlinear systems, and their applications; see the survey paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the references therein. In particular, the results closely related with this study are reviewed as follows. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Dunbar and Murray develop a distributed MPC strategy to handle continuous-time decoupled nonlinear subsystems with coupled objective functions. Further, the discrete-time case is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. By considering the coupled term as a bounded disturbance, Franco et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> study the distributed MPC problem for discrete-time decoupled nonlinear agent systems with delayed information exchange. In addition, some application-oriented research has been reported. For instance, the distributed MPC is designed for the cooperative control of multiple vehicles with delays in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the distributed MPC problem is investigated for a vehicle platoon to achieve leader-follower formation control. Note that these aforementioned results are developed without considering external disturbances to the system under study.</p><p>In practice, however, the system is inevitably subject to disturbances. How to design robust distributed MPC for decoupled nonlinear systems with disturbances remains open. This motivates us to develop a robust distributed MPC scheme that can accommodate external disturbances. It is worth noting that, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the robust distributed MPC problem is investigated for decoupled linear subsystems subject to external disturbances and coupled input constraints. This note focuses on the robust distributed MPC design for general continuous-time decoupled nonlinear subsystems subject to energy-bounded disturbances and control input constraints. The coupling caused by the centralized objective is incorporated into the distributed cost functions. This study extends the framework in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in terms of incorporating the disturbances into the analysis and synthesis, and therefore, the proposed distributed MPC design can accommodate the ubiquitous system noise or modeling errors.</p><p>It has been pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that, the conventional MPC may not be robust against external disturbances, and the closed-loop system might be destabilized even for small perturbations. In order to design a distributed MPC framework which will be robust against the external disturbances, a novel strategy called robustness constraint is proposed in this note. In addition, a robust dual-mode distributed MPC scheme is designed, and the conditions of guaranteeing the feasibility of the designed distributed MPC and the stability of the overall system are established. It is shown that, the stability conditions of the overall large-scale system are essentially related to the bound of external disturbances, the sampling period and the cooperation matrices. The overall large-scale system is proven to converge to an invariant set under the established conditions.</p><p>Notation: The superscripts "T" and " 1" represent the matrix transposition and the matrix inverse, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>Consider a large-scale nonlinear system consisting of agents and the model of each agent is described as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is the system state of agent , is the control input and is the external disturbance. Here, the control input is constrained in a compact set as , 0018-9286 © 2013 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.</p><p>with . The external disturbance is assumed to be bounded in a compact set and . Note that like <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the agents considered are of the same dimension, and they represent systems of the same class (e.g., interacting vehicles). This type of agent systems can be used for formation control and cooperative tracking control.</p><p>There are fixed communication networks deployed among the agents. For each agent , denote its neighbors as the agents from which it can receive information. The index set of agent 's neighbors is denoted as . We assume that each agent has at least one neighbor.</p><p>For the overall -agent system, it is assumed that each agent has the same sampling period , and the synchronization is ensured, i.e., every agent measures the system state of itself, receive the state trajectories from its neighbors and apply the control signal at the same time instants ,</p><p>, where . The design objective of this note is to develop a robust distributed MPC framework for the -agent system to achieve cooperation by explicitly considering the disturbances.</p><p>For each agent model in (1), the following standard assumption is made <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>:</p><p>Assumption 1: (a) The function has continuous second derivative and satisfies ; (b) each subsystem has a unique, absolutely continuous solution for any initial condition , any piecewise right-continuous control , and any disturbance realization . In general, the design of conventional or distributed MPC schemes needs a local state feedback law in the terminal set <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. To describe such a state feedback law, consider the linearized system of (1) at origin, which can be derived as , where , . For the linearized system, it is assumed that there exists a such that is stable. Define the nominal system in (1) as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> For the system in (2), we have the following lemma to design the terminal set.</p><p>Lemma 1: For the system in (2) with any given symmetric matrices and , there exist a constant and a symmetric matrix , such that: (1) The set is a control invariant set with the control law , i.e., any initial state implies , and , ;</p><p>(2) for any , the inequality holds, where and . Proof: Since is a state feedback law for the linearized system, the system is stable. Therefore, for any given symmetric matrices , , there exists a unique symmetric matrix satisfying the following Lyapunov equation:</p><p>(</p><p>Using (3), the proof can be derived by following the similar lines as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Thus, it is omitted here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ROBUST DISTRIBUTED MPC</head><p>For the -agent system, a new constrained optimization problem associated with each agent at time is designed as follows.</p><p>Problem: is called the assumed control trajectory which is generated as follows: when , and when , . Remark 1: The novelty of Problem 1 lies in the robustness constraint in (iv), compared to the optimization problems in the existing distributed MPC schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The roles of the robustness constraint in (iv) are two-fold: (1) It serves as the terminal constraint as in the conventional MPC and the distributed MPC when , i.e., , which is central to analyze the stability of the overall system; (2) it provides a monotonically decreasing boundary to confine the -weighted norm of during . This will make the cost function decrease even the subsystem is subject to disturbances. Since the optimal cost function will be qualified as a Lyapunov function, the constraint in (iv) provides robustness for the distributed MPC.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">, subject to: (i) , (ii) , (iii) , ,<label>(iv)</label></formula><p>Remark: Intuitively speaking, the role of the coupling term in ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is to render the state of agent close to that of agent to achieve certain cooperation, which originates from the centralized objective. In comparison with the cost function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> where the coupling term is only imposed on the positions (i.e., partial system states) with a special form, the cost function in (4) imposes couplings in all system states of each agent with a more general form. Note that the coupling constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> that can be used, e.g., for collision avoidance in multi-agent systems are not considered in Problem 1, and the consideration of such constraints in Problem 1 deserves further research.</p><p>Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we also adopt the dual-mode MPC strategy. That is, for each agent , when its system state is outside the terminal set , the control action is applied using the solution to Problem 1; otherwise, the control input is . Due to the disturbances, the actual system state is not available when . So we use to determine whether the actual system state is in the terminal set or not. Before establishing the testing criterion, we make the following assumption.</p><p>Assumption 2: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>: For each agent , the system model satisfies the following condition:</p><p>, where is a constant. Claim 1: For each agent , suppose that Assumption 2 holds. For any , if</p><p>then .</p><p>The proof of Claim 1 can be derived by applying <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ANALYSIS</head><p>In order to prove the iterative feasibility by the induction principle, Problem 1 needs to be feasible at the initial time instant (i.e., there exists a control trajectory driving the initial state into the terminal set while satisfying all the constraints). This requirement can be fulfilled by choosing an appropriate prediction horizon . Like the conventional MPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and nominal distributed MPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the following assumption is made with regard to the prediction horizon.</p><p>Assumption 3: For the -agent system at time , with the initial state , assume that there exists a prediction horizon such that Problem 1 associated with each agent has a solution.</p><p>For each agent with a given prediction horizon , all the initial state for which Problem 1 has a solution, is called the feasible set and, denoted as . To prove the iterative feasibility, the feasible control trajectory candidate at time is constructed as follows: when , and when . Here, is called the feasible state trajectory candidate that is generated as , , with</p><p>. The feasibility results are summarized in the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 1: For the -agent system, suppose that Assumption 1-2 hold. Given , , and the sampling period satisfies for all agents. If Problem 1 is feasible at time , then it is feasible at time for all . Here (6)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(7) (8)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The core of proving Theorem 1 is to show the fact that is a feasible control trajectory at time . To do that, we first develop conditions to make (iii) in Problem 1 hold based on and then to fulfill the robustness constraint in (iv) by using . The main tool to establish the results are the triangle inequality and the Gronwall-Bellman inequality. The proof is provided in the Appendix.</p><p>Remark 3: From Theorem 1, it can be seen that the feasibility is related with the bound of the disturbances and the sampling period as long as are given. In practical applications, the condition on can always be satisfied by appropriately choosing design parameter , and . The condition on the disturbance bound can be met only for practical systems with relatively small disturbance bounds. A possible way to increase is to reduce and/or increase . The condition on the sampling period can always be verified if the conditions on and are met. This is because these conditions suffice to guarantee a non-empty interval by the proof. The stability results for the -agent system are reported as follows. Theorem 2: For the -agent system with the initial state , suppose that Assumption 1-3 hold and . Given the prediction horizon , if (a) the sampling period is designed such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> </p><p>(b) the cooperation matrices satisfies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where , are constants with , and ; (c) the disturbance bound satisfies , where with ; then the overall system state will converge to the convergence set . The proof of Theorem 2 involves two steps. In the first step, we will prove that the optimal value of the cost function can be qualified as a Lyapunov function such that the system state will enter the terminal set in finite time. In the second step, the state will be proven to converge to the proposed convergence set. The detailed proof is reported in the Appendix.</p><p>Remark 4: Theorem 2 explicitly illustrates that the stability depends on the bound of the disturbances, the sampling period and the cooperation matrices. The condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> can always be satisfied, if is designed appropriately and the disturbance bound is not too large as discussed in Remark 3. It is nontrivial to verify the condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> which is a nonlinear inequality of . However, the condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> may be satisfied by tuning the design parameter , , and . In practical design, one way of designing is as follows: Step a) choose some initial parameters , and to calculate and , and solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> to derive an interval for ;</p><p>Step b) solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> to derive another interval ; Step c) if or is empty, go to step a) to tune the parameters and do the procedure again; otherwise, derive as a feasible interval of , and choose a value from the feasible interval as the designed sampling period.</p><p>Remark 5: It is worth noting that the design of needs to consider a tradeoff between the cooperation performance and the convergence of the overall agent system. In particular, should be designed as large as possible to achieve strong cooperations among agents, but if is designed too large, the closed-loop system may be divergent as the cooperation term may prevent the decrease of the cost function.</p><p>The condition in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) provides a sufficient condition on how to design to ensure convergence. In practical design, one needs to first solve the second-order inequality in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) to obtain the solution set of . Then the largest value within the solution set is chosen as to achieve the strongest cooperation while guaranteeing convergence, and , for each , , for example, can be designed as a matrix with all eigenvalues equal to that largest value.</p><p>V. SIMULATION STUDIES Consider a three-agent cart-damper-spring system, and each agent is modeled as where is the displacement of the cart, is its velocity, is the linear spring factor, is the damper factor, is the mass of the cart, is the control force and is the external disturbance. Such a system has been tested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for a single nonlinear system using the conventional MPC. For simplicity, each agent has the same system parameters. The parameters are given as ; ; and the control force is required to be bounded as . Each agent can receive information from the others. For each agent , the parameters of the cost function are the same and determined according to (3) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>). Set and . The local state feedback control gain is given by . According to Lemma 1, the matrix is determined as and the terminal set level is . The constant is determined as 2.73 using Lemma 3.2 and 3.3 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. and which satisfies in Theorem 1 and in Theorem 2, where the lower bound is calculated as 0.4568. According to Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, is required as . Thus, we set . The constants and are given as 0.4 and 0.001, respectively. is designed as , and, thus , , which meet the requirements in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</p><p>. The bound of the disturbance is set as which is less than the theoretical disturbance bound according to Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. Based on these designed parameters, the robust dual-mode distributed MPC scheme is executed by using MATLAB. For comparison, we also run the simulations using the centralized MPC scheme and the decentralized MPC scheme for the same system with the same  parameters. Since the centralized result is the ideal one, we plot the errors of the distributed MPC (shown as DMPC in figures) and decentralized one with respect to the centralized one in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, respectively. The control inputs of the distributed MPC are demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, it can be seen that the proposed robust dual-mode distributed MPC achieves better performance than that of the decentralized one. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> reveals that the control input constraints are satisfied and the designed distributed MPC is feasible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>We investigate the robust distributed MPC problem for a group of decoupled constrained nonlinear agent systems with external disturbances. By introducing a robustness constraint, we design a new robust dual-mode distributed MPC scheme that can deal with bounded external disturbances. Based on the triangle inequality and the Gronwall-Bellman inequality, it has been proven that the feasibility of the robust dual-mode distributed MPC can be guaranteed if the sampling period is appropriately chosen according to the established condition and the external disturbances are bounded by some critical values. Furthermore, it has been shown that, the overall agent system can be stabilized into a robust invariant set, provided that the sampling period, the disturbances and the cooperation matrices satisfy the designed conditions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
