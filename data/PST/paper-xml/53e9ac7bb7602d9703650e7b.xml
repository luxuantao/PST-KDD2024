Typically, such constrained models have singularities. This paper analyzes the generic local bifurcations including those which are directly related to the singularity. The notion of a feasibility region is introduced and analyzed. It consists of all equilibrium states that can be reached quasistatically from the current operating point without loss of l o d stab%@. It is shown that generically loss of stability at the feasibiity boundary is caused by one of three different local bifurcations, namely the well-known saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations and a new bifurcation called the singularity induced bifurcation which is analyzed precisely here for the first time. The latter results when an equilibrium point is at the singular surface. Under certain transversality conditions, the change in the eigenstructure of the system Jacobian at the equilibrium is established and the local dynamical structure of the trajectories near this bifurcation point is analyzed. It is shown generically that the constrained system behavior becomes unpredictable at the singularity induced bifurcation. Global bifurcations do not directly affect stability of equilibria, and as such they cannot occur on the feasibility boundary. Physical phenomena connected with the bifurcations are analyzed with an eye on the limitations of the constrained model. The results presented in this paper are general and applicable to any differential-algebraic equations system, while being motivated here by the large power system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION HE dynamics of a large class of physical systems can</head><p>T be modeled by parameter dependent differential-algebraic equations (DAE) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> of the form C: li: = f ( z , y, p ) , 0 =9(2, Y, P ) , f : IR"+"+q ---$ IR"</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">g: IRn+m+q ~ " (1) (2) z € X C E " , y € Y C E " , p E P C l R 4 .</formula><p>In the state-space X x Y , dynamic state variables IC and instantaneous state variables 1~ are distinguished. The dynamics of the states IC are directly defined by (1) while the dynamics of the y variables is such that the system satisfies the constraints (2). The parameters p define a specific system configuration and the operating condition.</p><p>As an example, for the power system, typical dynamic state variables are the time-dependent values of generator voltages and rotor phases, and instantaneous variables are bus voltages and other load flow variables. The parameter space P is composed of system parameters (which describe the system topography, i.e., which lines, buses, etc., are energized, and equipment constants such as inductances, transformation ratios, etc.), and operating parameters (such as loads, generation, voltage set-points, etc.). The dynamics of the generators, control devices, and the load dynamics together define the f equations. Typically the constraints g = 0 are defined by the power balance equations of the transmission system. Differential-algebraic systems of the form C have also been used to model the dynamics of many other physical systems The path toward developing an overall theory for large system operation in constrained systems of the form C leads through the study of its state and parameter spaces by identifying suitable regions of operation in these respective spaces. This paper focuses on such a concept by defining a feasible operating region in the parameter space. The feasibility region as defined here has the property that the system operation at the locally stable equilibrium point can be shifted around anywhere within this region by slow parametric variations without losing local stability at the equilibrium. Apart from the local stability requirement, there exist additional criteria for constructing "secure" regions of operation in physical systems. The additional requirements include: 1) inequality constraints on state variables (the viability concept in the power system) and 2) conditions on the ability of the system to survive certain large disturbances (the notion of transient stability in the power system) <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Based on these concepts, a theorybase for secure operating regions has been studied in [6]- <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> for the large system C. This paper analyzes the feasibility regions (related to local stability) in detail as a first step toward developing suitable operating regions in a physical system.</p><p>The bifurcation theory provides a natural platform for studying the parameter space phenomena by establishing the dynamic mechanisms that effect changes in the system structure upon parameter variations. When the system parameters are varied, the dynamics of the system C changes continuously; however, topologically the structure remains unchanged under small (parametric) perturbations provided the system is structurally stable <ref type="bibr">([91, [lo]</ref>) at the given parameter value. Structurally unstable points then identify the parameter values where the structure or the type of the system undergoes changes. This concept of structural stability naturally leads to the notion of typal regions in the parameter space which can be defined as the connected components of structurally stable parameter values within the parameter space. It follows that the topology of the state space or of the phase portrait remains uniform within a typal region; hence, the same type of system operation prevails within any typal region. Therefore the parameter space is composed of typal regions (regions of structural stability) bounded by bifurcation surfaces (structurally unstable points).</p><p>An understanding of all the typal regions and their boundaries could therefore provide us with a comprehensive overview of the system operation clearly outlining the evolution of all significant dynamic phenomena. For smallscale systems, such a characterization of typal regions is indeed possible, and an example can be seen in (1 11 and [ 121 for a two-dimensional (n = 2) rudimentary power system model. At the present time, however, such a complete overview of the parameter space seems to be impossible even theoretically for large nonlinear systems. This is because the boundary of the typal regions consists of local and global bifurcations. Specifically the global bifurcations in general can themselves be dense in open sets of the parameter space (see [9], complex behavior), which then renders the problem extremely difficult to analyze even for system dimension three (n = 3), let alone the large system. For these reasons and as a first step, we restrict the analysis in this paper to the study of a simpler concept in the parameter space called the notion of feasibility regions.</p><p>Feasibility regions are defined as the union of certain typal regions with the property that the operating point is guaranteed to be locally stable under any quasistatic parameter variation within the feasibility region. Therefore within a feasibility region, as the parameters are varied, there may exist several structurally different system types; however, the local stability at the current operating point remains unaffected by crossing these interior typal boundaries. An example is a distant saddle point changing to say a source which is a local bifurcation, hence forming a typal boundary; however, this bifurcation is practically uninteresting and is ignored within the feasibility region. Thus the authors' analysis reveals a two-level cellular structure of the parameter space as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> (a similar structure emerges for the state space, but the latter will not be discussed here</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[6]-[8]).</formula><p>In Section I1 of this paper, the notion of feasibility regions is developed precisely, and we show that the feasibility boundary (the boundary of the feasibility region) has an inherently simple algebraic structure and hence can be easily computed even in very large scale systems. In Section 111, it is proved that generically the feasibility boundary for the DAE system C consists of the set of closures of three bifurcation surfaces, namely the well-known saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations and a new bifurcation called the singularity induced bifurcation [6].</p><p>Systems of the form C typically have singular points where the implicit function theorem for solving the constraints g = 0 is not applicable. When the constraints (2) are absent  <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>). For constrained models C, however, the feasibility boundary typically also contains another bifurcation segment named (by us) the singularity induced bifurcation which occurs when the system equilibrium is at the singularity. When this happens, it has been observed that some of the system eigenvalues may become unbounded ([11]-[ 171). This scenario is rigorously analyzed in [ 113 and [12] for a specific power system model with n = 2 and m = 1. For the general large system, under certain transversality conditions, we have proved [6] that the eigenstructure of the system Jacobian changes at this bifurcation point with one eigenvalue diverging to infinity. Here the analysis is extended to explore the geometry of the system trajectories near all three bifurcation boundaries. For the saddle-node bifurcation boundary, such an analysis was presented in [18] for certain unconstrained power system models.</p><p>The roles of Hopf [19] and saddle-node bifurcations [13] in understanding specific power system phenomena have been recognized recently. Hopf bifurcations have been observed in power system models connected with unstable limit cycles ([ll], [12], [20]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>). It has been observed that system transients near Hopf bifurcation points are oscillatory ([ 111, <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>); this will also be demonstrated in this paper for the large system using the center manifold theory. Currently, computational methods are being developed for locating the saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations in the parameter space</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">([251-[271).</formula><p>For the singularity induced bifurcation, it will be shown that generically even when the equilibrium is at the singularity, there exists an (n -1)-dimensional invariant manifold W r e g that passes through the singularity such that the dynamics E restricted to the invariant manifold is smooth. Moreover, this invariant manifold is locally "attracting" on one side of the singular surface and "repelling" on the other side, thereby providing a "conduit" for the trajectories from one side of the singular surface to cross over to the other side at finite speed, possibly either 1) diverging toward a new steady-state condition or 2) ending at the singular surface. The constrained model C itself does not provide sufficient information to distinguish between the two different types of behaviors near the singularity. In this sense, the singularity induced bifurcation denotes a true barrier to predictable behavior with the model C from a mathematical as well as an engineering viewpoint. Moreover, the loss of reliable system prediction using C at this bifurcation follows for any constrained model of the form C under certain generic transversality assumptions and is not related to specific modeling assumptions like the limitations of the quasistationary assumption in phasor power system models. More details will be given in Section V.</p><p>Global bifurcations have also been studied with much interest recently since some of these bifurcations may indicate chaotic system behavior ([ll], [12], [217, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>, [281- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[311)</ref>. For the reasons mentioned above, global bifurcations are not relevant to the study of the feasibility region and therefore this paper only deals with the generic local bifurcations for the large system E.</p><p>The organization of the paper is as follows. The definition and properties of the feasibility region are given in Section 11, and the principal local bifurcation structure of the feasibility boundary is analyzed in Section 111. The singularity induced bifurcation is established in detail in Section J Y .</p><p>Discussions on the physical implications of all the three generic bifurcations, namely the saddle-node, Hopf, and the singularity induced bifurcations, follow in Section V with special emphasis on the constrained nature (2) of the model E; some illustrative simulations are given in Section VI. Even though the illustrations are given for the power system, the results as stated are applicable to any system of the form E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">FEASIBILITY REGIONS</head><p>A notion of feasibility regions is introduced in this section by identifying the set of all equilibrium points which can be reached quasistatically (or in a stationary sense) from a given stable equilibrium point by continuous parameter variations without loss of stability. Roughly speaking, two stable equilibrium points belong to the same feasibility region if they are connected by continuous quasistatic parameter variations so that local stability is preserved all along the equilibrium locus connecting the two equilibria. This concept is made precise below by formally defining the feasibility region as a connected component of the set of all stable equilibria for the nonlinear system C .</p><p>For the constrained system C, define the set of all equilibria to be EQ and let OP denote the set of all stable equilibria defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">EQ = {(z, y, p ) E X x Y x P: f(z, Y, P) = 0, Y, P) = 0) ( 3 ) all eigenvalues o f J = ~, f -D,f(D,g)-lD,g have negative real parts}.</formula><p>(4) OP = {(x, y, p ) E EQ: D,gis nonsingular and Here D,., etc., denotes the matrix of partial derivatives of the components of f with respect to Z. All the topological definitions that follow are with respect to EQ. Note that the definition of OP above assumes the stability of the constrained model C within the full state space. That is, the "fast" y dynamics in the ambient state space around the constraint defined by g = 0 is assumed to be stable at the current operating point. Such a stability condition would depend on the system specifics, and for the large power system in general, it remains an open question under what conditions this property holds.</p><p>Note that the full Jacobian (2: %: , " , ) of the functions f and g in the x and y coordinates is nonsingular for all (z, y, p) E QP and therefore, by the implicit function theorem, the equations f(x,y,p) = 0 and g(z,y,p) = 0 can theoretically be solved uniquely for z and y as functions of the parameter p , locally near any equilibrium point in OP. Hence OP is a p-dimensional submanifold embedded in EQ C X x Y x P . Now we can formally define the feasibility region as follows.</p><p>Definition 1: Given a stable equilibrium (xo, yo) for parameter value p ~, the connected component F of O P which contains ( $ 0 , yo, p o ) is called the feasibility region of ( 2 0 , yo, PO). Its boundary (relative to E&amp;) is the feasibility boundary. cl</p><p>Note that the feasibility region is defined as a subset of X x Y x P, not as a subset of the parameter space. Typically only one solution will satisfy the viability requirements and hence qualify as an actual operating point. Therefore, typically the viable portion of the feasibility region has a well-defined projection into the parameter space.</p><p>It should be pointed out that different notions of feasibility have existed in linear control theory (in the context of robust stability) since the development of the root locus design methods (and in other engineering problem areas such as the feasible regions in optimization theory and load-flow feasible regions in the power system <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref>). Definition 1 of feasibility provides a convenient mathematical apparatus for analyzing the local stability properties in the nonlinear DAE system C in light of special nonlinear phenomena that may arise near the equilibrium point. The feasibility boundary theorem, which is presented next, proves that the feasibility boundary for the large system can be solved for as the common zeros (called zero sets hereafter) of three different sets of functions. In Sections I11 and IV, it is shown that these three zero sets, namely 1) Cs, 2) C;, and 3) C, defined in the theorem below, are each connected with a special nonlinear property, which are, respectively, 1) equilibria at the singularity, 2) proximity of multiple equilibria, and 3) birth of limit cycles, for the nonlinear system E. Moreover all the three zero sets generically correspond to loss of local stability as proved in Section 111-D. The proof of the theorem below is intuitive as seen from the eigenvalue loci shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>.</p><p>Theorem I (Feasibility Boundary Theorem): For a system defined in (1) and (2), the feasibility boundary of a feasibility region F consists of three zero sets where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d F = (dF n Cs) U ( d F n C z ) U (dF n C H ) (5) ~ I S l N G U M I N -1 SADDLE ~ NODE INDUCED \ - (a) (b) (C)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">Cs = {(z, y, p ) E EQ: det D,g = 0},</formula><p>(z, y, p ) E EQ: det Dyg # 0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Dxf Dyf det (Dxg D y g ) = O} and (z, y, p ) E EQ: det D,g # 0, Dxf Dyf det (Dsg D Y g ) # O7</formula><p>1 det [Hn-l(J)] = 0 but nonzero, eigenvalues. Zero eigenvalues occur in the set CZ. It follows from classical control theory that the Hunvitz determinant, Hn-l(J), vanishes at boundary points of F where the Jacobians D,g and J are nonsingular, and J has purely imaginary eigenvalues <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref>. Also, if Hn_1(J) = 0 at some point in d F , then, as there can be no eigenvalues of J in (I?, J must have eigenvalues on the imaginary axis (the presence of eigenvalues which are symmetric about the imaginary axis, not on the imaginary axis, is ruled out since J was stable). By construction, for the points in C H , J has no zero eigenvalues. Hence the points in d F n CH correspond to purely imaginary eigenvalues of J .</p><p>Q.E.D.</p><p>It is interesting to point out that when all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian J are in F, such as in the feasibility boundary, the occurrence of purely imaginary eigenvalues for the system Jacobian J can be detected as a zero set using the Hurwitz determinant <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref>. In the theorem above, this classical result from linear system theory nicely fits into the local stability analysis of a nonlinear system, proving that the feasibility boundary is composed of the three zero sets CS, C Z , and C H .</p><p>To analyze the structure of the feasibility boundary, we will analyze the principal segments of the boundary and show that each of the three sets corresponds to a specific codimension one bifurcation. The remaining lower dimensional subsets correspond to higher codimension bifurcations which generally are more difficult to analyze though they are of interest in originating global bifurcations ([9], [3 13).</p><p>corresponding to the coefficients ai of the characteristic polynomial of J and ah = 0 for k &gt; n. occur at all these points (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), namely a singularity induced bifurcation in Cs, a saddle-node bifurcation in Cz, and a Hopf bifurcation in CH. Moreover, generically these bifurcations constitute a dense subset of the feasibility boundary for (1) and (2). Saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations are well known in the literature [9], and their definitions will be summarized here for the reader's convenience. The singularity induced bifurcation will be analyzed in Section IV. </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">D z f D y f %f D x A D,A D p A has rank n + m + 1.</formula><p>The detailed analysis of the singularity induced bifurcation is presented in Section IV. It is proved that at the singularity induced bifurcation, the number of stable eigenvalues of the system changes by one when this eigenvalue becomes unbounded. For understanding the system transient behavior or the instability mechanisms near this bifurcation, it is necessary to develop a detailed analysis of the system dynamics, which will be presented in Section IV-D. Based on these mathematical results and with an understanding of the limitations of the constrained model, we proceed to explore the physical system behavior near the singularity induced bifurcation in Section V-A.</p></div>

Saddle-Node Bijkrcation</head><p>The saddle-node bifurcation is well understood mathematically and has been much studied in the power system literature. A saddle-node bifurcation occurs when a system has a nonhyperbolic equilibrium with a geometrically simple zero eigenvalue at the bifurcation voint and additional transversalitv conditions are satisfied (Sotomayor's Theorem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[35]</ref>). By definition, the points in the set Cz are not singular, i.e., det (Dyg) # 0.

Hopf Bifurcation</head><p>A Hopf bifurcation occurs at points where the system has a nonhyperbolic equilibrium connected with a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues, but no zero eigenvalues, and additional transversality conditions are met (Hopf Theorem, [9]).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Loss of Stability Theorem</head><p>It is clear that the three bifurcation types discussed above arise when additional independent inequality constraints are imposed on points in the sets Cs, C Z , and C H . These conditions are relatively open in the respective zero sets and generically will be satisfied on dense subsets. In other words, the following assumptions are generic:</p><p>D1) The set of points where {(SIl), (5'12), (S13)) are satisfied is oDen and dense in C S . In this paper, loss of stability denotes the parametric condition where the local stability does not persist for some nearby parameters. That is, we say that the equilibrium point (50, yo, PO) undergoes parameter initiated loss of stability, when there exist small parameter variations such that no stable equilibria exist for the new parameter values. Note that a saddle-node bifurcation at the equilibrium point leads to loss of stability since there exist no equilibria locally for parameter values on the "wrong" side of the bifurcation point. On the other hand, degenerate bifurcations where the system eigenvalues "touch" the imaginary axis for some parameter values only to return to the open left-half plane under parameter variations may qualify as interior segments of the feasibility boundary and are not connected with loss of stability in this sense.

By the singularity induced bifurcation theorem proven below ([6] and Section IV), the saddle-node bifurcation theorem [9] and Hopf bifurcation theorem [9], each of the three bifurcations corresponds to loss of stability.

Thus loss of stability occurs at every feasibility boundary point, and the three principal bifurcations are the 1) saddlenode, 2) Hopf, and 3) singularity induced bifurcations. These are also the principal (i.e., codimension one) segments of the feasibility boundary. Degenerate feasibility boundary segments which arise as the mutual boundaries of these three principal bifurcation manifolds such as the saddle-node-Hopf intersections B ~N n BH n d F are not studied here; however, these can be related to the birth of certain global bifurcations such as saddle connections <ref type="bibr">([91, [31]</ref>) and hence are of interest in analyzing complex system phenomena. Moreover, note that the loss of stability as defined here strictly corresponds to the equilibrium losing its local stability and the resulting system behavior depends on the specific bifurcation boundary. For instance, we will see in Section V-C that Hopf feasibility --boundary segments correspond to the transition of system operation from stable equilibria to stable sustained oscillations when the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical.</p><p>For computational purposes, a result from algebraic stratification theory is presented below which exploits the property that general power system models only contain polynomials and polynomial functions of sinusoidal functions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Iv. ANALYSIS OF THE SINGULARITY INDUCED BIFURCATION</head><p>When the steady-state solution or an equilibrium point in EQ approaches the singularity S , it has been observed that some eigenvalues of the system Jacobian at the equilibrium point may become unbounded ([ 1114 171). In [ 111 and [ 121, it was shown that for a two-dimensional system, this case generally is "equivalent" to a transcritical bifurcation ("exchange of stability" bifurcation [9]). In the large system, however, it is no longer related to the transcritical bifurcation. In this section, we analyze this scenario for the general system (1) and (2), when the equilibrium approaches the singularity. As the change in the structure is due to the presence of the singular surface, we call this bifurcation a singularity induced bifurcation. Note that when the equilibrium is at the singularity, the</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Jacobian J := D, f -D, f (D,g)-'D,g is not well defined because D,g is singular.</formula><p>Intuitively it is clear that the Jacobian J might have some unbounded eigenvalues near the bifurcation point, because J involves the inversion of a singular matrix D,g. From an engineering point of view, the critical questions then are: 1) Does the equilibrium "survive" the bifurcation (unlike in the case of the saddle-node bifurcation)? and 2) Do the real parts of the (unbounded) eigenvalues at the equilibrium change sign? A change in the sign of the real parts of the eigenvalues is significant because then the stability status of the equilibrium would undergo a change at the bifurcation point. The singularity induced bifurcation theorem to be presented in this section proves that generically the equilibrium exists near the bifurcation and the stability status of the equilibrium undergoes a change with exactly one eigenvalue becoming unbounded at the bifurcation point. Hence this bifurcation corresponds to a loss of stable operation at the current stable equilibrium point as defined above.</p><p>For the large power system, we need to be careful in interpreting the results near the singularity because the validity of the phasor dynamic model C hinges on the quasistationary assumption, namely that the speeds of the states II: and 1~ are slow as compared to the carrier signal (of frequency 60 Hz in the US). It can be shown that the error caused by the quasistationary approximation is zero at the equilibrium since the speeds are zero there but the error grows in magnitude away from the equilibrium. Typically the quasistationary assumption serves as an excellent approximation everywhere within the state space except near the singular segments where the error becomes unbounded <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Specifically local arguments such as stability of the equilibrium point based on the model C are applicable near an equilibrium as long as the equilibrium is away from the singularity. Therefore, the local stability results of the mathematical model C are physically valid locally near the equilibrium everywhere, except possibly at the bifurcation point itself when the equilibrium is at the singularity. Of course, the size of the neighborhood in which these results are applicable may and typically will shrink to zero as the singularity induced bifurcation point is reached. Here we note that since the equilibrium becomes unstable after the bifurcation and is away from the singularity in the model C as will be proved in the theorem, the equilibrium in the actual system does indeed become locally unstable upon crossing the singularity induced bifurcation boundary. Irrespective of the modeling issues discussed above, physical system operation at the current operating state ends before the singularity induced bifurcation boundary. In other words, the singularity induced bifurcation segment of the feasibility boundary corresponds to a true physical boundary (quite predictable) for stable system operation at the current operating point. Caution should be exercised in analyzing the exact nature of the transients diverging from the unstable equilibrium because of the failing quasistationarity near the singular surface. A detailed analysis of the transients follows in Sections IV-E and V-A.</p></div>

An interesting question comes up naturally. Note that at the singularity induced bifurcation point, the equilibrium point is at the singularity. Since at an equilibrium point all velocities must be zero, for any smooth dynamical system, by continuity, we expect that the dynamics near an equilibrium point will be slow. On the other hand, the dynamics are extremely fast near the singular surface. In fact, according to the model C, the velocities are typically unbounded [see (19)l. When the equilibrium is at the singularity, there is a contradiction of sorts, and the natural question is which of the two behaviors is to be expected physically. Does the infinite slowing down near the equilibrium dominate over the extremely fast behavior of the trajectories near the singularity? In other words, does the singular behavior get "cancelled" by the equilibrium behavior? Let us look at a simple example.</p><p>1, 2, .have nonzero real parts.</p></div>

When p = 0, the system equilibria coincide with the singular points at ( f l , 0) and the dynamics are smooth over L with Z = (x2 -1, zy).

U</p><p>The question on the speed of the states is especially significant for the large power system because, if the dynamics near the equilibrium at the singularity were slow, then the problems raised by the quasistationarity disappear and the results from the phasor model can be directly interpreted for the physical system even at the singularity induced bifurcation. Unfortunately, such is not the case as will be shown in the next section. The singularity induced bifurcation stands as a true barrier for predictable system behavior using the phasor model E. For the large system, it will be proved that generically both equilibrium and singular behaviors "coexist" when the equilibrium is at the singularity. On the one hand, it will be shown under certain inequality assumptions that, when the equilibrium is at the singularity, the system is smooth (hence slow) near the equilibrium when restricted to an ( n -1)-dimensional invariant manifold. On the other hand, it is also shown that there also exists the singularity as an (n -1)-dimensional manifold passing through the equilibrium, such that near this singular manifold the C dynamics is extremely fast. Therefore caution must be exercised in drawing conclusions about physical system behavior near the singularity induced bifurcation. First we prove some basic mathematical results which will aid us in the analysis to follow in Section IV-E.</p></div>

Moreover the local dynamic properties at the equilibrium point on the manifold Wreg remain unchanged before and after the occurrence of the singularity induced bifurcation. On the other hand, there exists another onedimensional invariant manifold called W s z n g in the theorem which is associated with the eigenvalue that becomes unbounded (with a change in the sign of its real part) at the bifurcation point where the change in stability status at the equilibrium point takes place. In other words, the next theorem proves the existence of two invariant manifolds WTeg(n -1 dimensional) and W s z n g (one-dimensional) which together determine the local dynamic features of the equilibrium point at the singularity induced bifurcation.</p><p>Note that while such results on invariant manifolds are natural for smooth systems from the center manifold theory, the existence of such invariant manifolds in the singular system C is highly nontrivial. The trick in proving this result is to first develop the invariance results for the transformed smooth system ZT using the center manifold theory and then to carefully translate the results for the DAE system 2. Specifically the proof of the next theorem exploits results from the singularity induced bifurcation theorem on the eigenproperties of Z and ZT at the singularity induced bifurcation. The main structural features of the system C near the singularity induced bifurcation are presented in the next theorem.

A single parameter p is considered again, and it follows that R is an [ ( n -1) + 11-dimensional submanifold of the singular set S . It can be shown [6] that at any transverse singular point, say z , there exist precisely two trajectories of C which either converge to z at infinite speeds transverse to the singular set R or originate from z at infinite speeds transverse to R. The set of transverse singular points where two trajectories are converging corresponds to the case when (D,A)r; is negative and the latter when (DyA)lc is positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>. Therefore the set of transverse singular points can be divided into transverse sinks Our analysis of the DAE dynamics in this section (quoted from [421) provides an explicit characterization of the forward impasse points (the set Rst) and the backward impasse points (the set Rs0) for the DAE system C based on the geometric analysis of Z T . Moreover note that the impasse nature of the transverse singular points is true for any constrained model of the form C and is not related to the quasistationary issues in power system models. For the power system models, however, the infinite speeds near the transverse singular points would also contradict the underlying quasistationary assumption, again leading to the same conclusion that the model C breaks down at the singularity.</p><p>The next result will prove that the regular manifold W r e g separates two different transient behaviors near the singularity induced bifurcation. Trajectories which originate near WTeg on one side of WTeg will be shown to reach the transverse singular points thus resulting in the breakdown of the model C. Trajectories starting near WTeg on the other side of W T e g , however, diverge away smoothly leaving a local neighborhood of the equilibrium, so the constrained model C would not face the impasse situation. Unfortunately, using the model C, it is not possible to distinguish between the two types of transients near the singularity induced bifurcation, and hence the model C breaks down for analyzing the transients near this bifurcation.</p><p>2) Pseudoequilibria and Semisingular Points: The transverse singular points R introduced above emerge as the most nondegenerate subset of the singular points S when the inequality condition (DyA)6 # 0 is imposed.

Note that the pseudoequilibria in Q are special in the sense that they are actually equilibria of ZT as seen from the definition of ZT; however, the pseudoequilibria generally are not equilibria for the DAE system 2, hence, the name pseudoequilibria. The equilibrium nature of Q for ZT is thus related to the nonuniqueness of solutions of 2 at the pseudoequilibria.

In Section IV-D, Theorem 4 proved the existence of two invariant manifolds Wreg and Wszng which play pivotal roles in determining the local dynamics near the singularity induced bifurcation. From Theorem 4, it follows that the flow on the (n -1)-dimensional manifold Wreg is smooth and remains topologically unchanged at the bifurcation. The change in local stability of the bifurcating equilibrium occurs along the one-dimensional manifold Wszng so that the flow on Wszng undergoes a structural change (trajectories reverse directions) at , U = PO. In this section, we relate these results to the state-space singularity structure from Theorem 5 to draw conclusions on the time-domain behavior of trajectories of the DAE system C near the singularity induced bifurcation.</p><p>Recall from Section IV-E3) that the singularity S divides into three subsets, namely the subset R of transverse singular points, the subset 9 of pseudoequilibrium points, and the subset S of semisingular points.

Assumption SE) enforces a rigid geometric structure at the bifurcation point essentially for guaranteeing that the pseudoequilibria Q' defined by g = 0, A = 0, and K = 0 form a ( n -2)dimensional smooth manifold near the bifurcation point by assuming that the gradients of these functions are linearly independent at (0, 0, pa).

Also by SI6), semisingular points do not exist near (0, 0, p) hence the singularity S contains only transverse singular points and pseudoequilibria near the bifurcation point (0, 0, pug).</p><p>Using these properties, in the next theorem, we prove that the local singular dynamic structure near the singularity induced bifurcation is better organized than what was proved in Theorem 4. We prove that the invariant manfiold Wreg has the property that Wreg n S = 9 and moreover all the pseudoequilibrium points strictly lie on Wreg. Therefore, the singularity S contains only transverse singular points R outside Wreg which are either forward (R,i) or backward (R,,) impasse points from Section IV-El). We also prove that there are both types near the bifurcation so that in fact S = R,, U 9 U R,, for each p near po with Wreg n S = 6.</p><p>More precisely it follows that Wreg separates the singularity S into transverse sinks R,, on one side of Wreg and transverse sources R,, on the other side of WTeg.</p><p>In summary, Assumptions SI1)-SI6) so far guarantee the ( n -1)-dimensional smooth manifolds Wreg and S intersect along the ( n -2)-dimensional smooth manifold 9 for the parameter values p near po. For geometrical nicety, we require this intersection of Wreg and S to be transversal since this simplifies the analysis of the trajectories near the two manifolds. Recall from the proof of Theorem 4 that the manifold W = U, W r e g ( p ) is chosen to be the center manifold C associated with the (n -1) + 1 (the nth zero eigenvalue is from the parameter dependence equation , h = 0) zero eigenvalues of ZT at (0, 0, PO). Hence the tangent space of W is explicitly characterized by the eigenvectors corresponding to these ( n -1) + 1 zero eigenvalues. Moreover the singularity S is a ( n -1) + 1 manifold at (0, 0, pug) from SI5) which has the gradient Jsa as its normal vector. Therefore the condition on the transversal intersection of W and S at (0, 0, po) can be easily developed as an algebraic criterion first in suitable local chart coordinates using the relevant eigenvectors and then restated as a rank condition on a Jacobian such as Jga in the original coordinates. The construction though technical is straightforward and the following rank condition S17) guarantees that indeed W and S intersect transversely at S17) The Jacobian Jga has rank m + 1 at (0, 0, po) after the elimination of the column ( D g * g ) where y, is so chosen that (Dzg D,g) has rank m after the elimination of the column D,$g.</p><p>Next using center manifold theoretic arguments, it is shown that the invariant manifold Wreg is itself locally attracting or repelling trajectories on the two sides of the singularity S.</p><p>Therefore for each p near po, the two (n -1)-dimensional manifolds, 1) the singularity S and 2) the manifold Wreg, divide a local neighborhood into four connected components C1, Cz, C3, and C4 so that there exists a different timedomain behavior in each of these four components.

To prove the second statement in LD4), first note from the proof of Theorem 4 that the dynamics for ZT on W = C is of the form ZT = Z'A and A = 0 corresponds to the singularity on C.

The three bifurcation segments of the feasibility boundary discussed in this paper are physical boundaries in the parameter space where stable system operation ends as the parameter crosses the boundary segment. There is a need for understanding how the instability develops in the state space around the operating point when such boundaries are encountered in real system operation. Such an understanding will help us in developing some intuition on the type of instability which the system may face at a particular feasibility boundary segment and for on-line identification of imminent trouble in real system operation so that suitable countermeasures can be initiated. Hence the discussion in this section is aimed at an engineering analysis of the bifurcations (unlike the rigorous mathematical treatment in the previous sections) for developing the qualitative evolution of the state space dynamics near the feasibility boundary segments. The analysis of the saddle-node bifurcation segments was developed in [18] motivated by the voltage collapse phenomena in a large (unconstrained) power system model based on certain assumptions on the parameter variation. Here we will proceed to consider all the three boundary segments in sequence for the constrained system E. The variation of a single p a m e t e r p will be considered to simplify the presentation, but the results naturally extend to the full set of parameters p with the transversality assumptions as stated in Section m.</p><p>For the saddle-node and Hopf feasibility boundary segments, namely for Bsp,~ n d F and BH n d F , the structural changes which lead to the bifurcation phenomena (in other words the instability mechanisms) are well understood in nonlinear dynamics <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> and are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">5</ref> (saddle-node bifurcation) and Figs. 6 and 7 (Hopf bifurcations), respectively. In general, it can be shown that near these feasibility boundary segments, the system transients are locally characterized by the trajectories on the associated center manifold denoted C in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">5</ref><ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref>. Specifically, if the system operation is outside the feasibility region near the saddle-node bifurcation segment, then the transient will move toward the center manifold at a fast rate, and near the center manifold C, it will move along the center unstable trajectory as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">5(c</ref>). Therefore, the saddle-node type instability mechanism for the large power system can be interpreted as a monotonous movement locally along the direction of the center manifold. exist over a period of time can lead to permanent damage in expensive power equipment; hence these boundary segments are important. The case a &gt; 0 of subcritical Hopf is more interesting as an instability phenomenon. Outside the feasibility region, the transients locally converge to the center manifold C at exponential speeds, and near the center manifold, they diverge away from the unstable equilibrium in an oscillatory fashion as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7(c)</ref>.</p></div>

Specifically for power system models, the existence of the smooth manifold W T e g is physically significant because the phasor equations are still applicable on the invariant manifold W T e g . The trajectories can cross over from the component C--C+ along W T e g in finite speeds. But then in C+, they may either diverge away (e.g., along the WSing(po) n C, trajectory, hence, a monotone divergence, from (42), Theorem 4) or reach the singular surface, depending on which side of W r e g they emerge. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that Theorem 4 proves analytically that the transients near the singularity induced bifurcation can be smooth, showing no signs of fast or violent system behavior. A simulation example in Section IV-A2) of a rudimentary power system illustrates the results in this section.</p></div>

ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES</head><p>The results in the previous sections are valid for the large DAE system C with no restrictions on the size of the system or the model complexity, as long as the functions f and g in the models are smooth. In this section, simulations of a simple two bus power system model (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>) are used to illustrate the results conceptually.

Two types of voltage control are studied, namely the excitation control at the generator end and an SVC (Static VAR Compensator) control at the load end. Since there is only one inertia in this system, the angle is a free variable in this simple system and the voltage dynamics can be isolated from the angle dynamics (refer to [ l l ] and <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> for more details on the modeling assumptions). Using a simplified one axis generator model (55) and a first-degree excitation control dynamics (56), which is a simplification of the IEEE Type 1 model of the excitation control, the model for this rudimentary case can be stated as the DAE model shown below <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>.

The other notations are conventional. In the notation of this paper, the state-space dimensions are n = 2 and m = 1. For the excitation control, the state space consists of z = {E', E f d } and y = {E}, where E' is the generator internal voltage [(55) is the flux decay equation], Efd is the field voltage [(56) is the field excitation control equation], and E is the load bus voltage [(57) is the power balance equation]. Similarly for the SVC control, the state space is composed of z = {E', B,} and y = { E } where B, is the SVC admittance. Even in this rudimentary system, the parameter space is high dimensional consisting of several equipment and line constants and various control parameters. Among the parameters, { Z d , z&amp;, z, Tio} and {P, Qo, H , B , K , T , E,, Eyd} can be distinguished as, respectively, the system parameters (which typically are constants) and the operating parameters (which can vary during system operation).

It can be shown [12] that this rudimentary system has at most two equilibria, say Xh and xt, corresponding to highand low-load bus voltages. So there are two sets of local bifurcations connected, respectively, with the high Xh and low xe voltage equilibria along with the saddle-node bifurcation where these two equilibria meet and annihilate each other. Therefore, for either equilibrium point, feasibility ends at the saddle-node bifurcation, unless it ended elsewhere before.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">9</ref>(a) and (b) outline all the bifurcations (local and global) for the rudimentary system within the windows of the respective plots. These then are by definition the typal boundaries, i.e., loci where state-space topology changes. Feasibility, however, is defined over the region where a specific stable equilibrium point has persistent local stability. Hence, when identifying the feasibility boundary and region for the high equilibrium Xh, only bifurcation surfaces connected with the stable high equilibrium x h are relevant as shown by heavy lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">9</ref> Moreover, for a general nonlinear system, there may exist many feasibility regions connected with different stable equilibria. For the rudimentary system, indeed there exist two feasibility regions related to the two equilibria Xh (discussed above) and xe. The feasibility boundaries for these two regions, that is, for the high voltage x h and the low voltage xe equilibria will be different and are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">1O(a</ref>) and (b) for the excitation control and SVC control cases, respectively. In Fig. <ref type="bibr">lO(a)</ref>, the feasibility region is larger for the lower equilibrium xe compared to that of x h at heavy loads (above D) and vice versa. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10(b)</ref>, however, the feasibility region for the high voltage equilibrium x h is always larger compared to that of the low voltage equilibrium Xe. Interestingly, these two types of control for this example result in diagrams which are both quite different in detail yet rather similar in their overall structure. Moreover, caution is in order while assessing the practical validity of the feasibility region related to xt for this rudimentary system because of other related issues such as viability concerns (possibly resulting in too high line currents) and stability requirements in the sense of overall system dynamics which are not considered in this paper.</p><p>Details of these occurrences are available in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>.

In some cases, such degenerate bifurcations also lead to the birth of interesting global phenomena [31] as seen by the presence of the global bifurcation called the saddle connection bifurcation BSC (related to homo-clinic orbits [9] in the state space) in Fig. 9(a) near point A. Moreover, such internal (degenerate) feasibility boundary segments are covered by the closures of the three principal bifurcation segments namely the saddle-node, Hopf, and the singularity induced bifurcations in Figs. 9(a) and ll(b). These results, therefore, are consistent with the statement of Theorem 2.</figDesc></figure>

Phase portraits near the saddle node bifurcation point on the feasibility boundary for the rudimentary system in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> with SVC control <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref>. Parameters are as in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> the trajectories 0-and p+ diverge away from the now unstable equilibrium z? so that the dynamics in the manifold Wszng is unstable (statement LD2) in Theorem 4). Therefore, dynamically the change in the stability status of the equilibrium z~ can be seen by the reversal of the trajectories in the invariant manifold Wszng. The local decomposition observed here directly dictates the system behavior near the bifurcation point as analyzed in Section IV-E.</p><p>Let us consider the power values P &gt; 0.5. All the trajectories near the regular manifold Wreg in the component C-[the trajectories y-in Fig. <ref type="figure">1 l(c)</ref>] move toward the manifold Wreg and converge to the special singular point $. By Theorem 4, the movement on the manifold Wre9 itself is smooth even at the singularity. In other words, the union of the trajectories y-, the point $, and the trajectory rf forms a smooth trajectory for this system. The same result can also be seen by considering the limits of the speeds along the trajectories approaching the special singular point $ called the pseudoequilibrium point in <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. Therefore, the speed along the trajectories yand 7 : at the point $ is finite, so the quasistationary assumption for the power system is not violated while crossing the singularity at $. The trajectory y : itself, however, is repelling in the sense that the trajectories are moving away from y : in the component C+ (statement LD5.3) in Theorem 4).</p><p>The trajectories diverging away from y : display two drastically different behaviors as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">1 l(c</ref>). The trajectories which originate below y : reach the singularity, therefore leading to the collapse of the model E. On the other hand, the trajectories which start near y : above y : converge to the stable equilibrium xi, hence, are possibly transient stable.</p><p>Therefore the trajectory 7 : (which is the Wreg manifold for this example) divides the component C+ into two subsets namely CI (above 7 ;</p><p>) and C2 (below 7 :</p><p>) so that there exist drastically different behaviors in C, (leaves a local neighborhood) and C2 (transverse convergence to the singularity Rsz) near the regular manifold Wreg (analytically this follows from Theorem 6). But as for as all the trajectories near ywhich reach $ (at finite speed) are considered, there is no way to determine (with the model C) whether the trajectory after crossing $J would emerge above or below 7 :</p><p>. There is a loss of uniqueness of solutions for C at the point $. Therefore, using the model C, there is no way to predict the nature of all the local transients near the singularity induced bifurcation, as/ claimed in Section V-A.</p><p>Also note that there still exists the possibility that after the bifurcation itself, a transient may display quite smooth behavior, settling down to a different steady state as is the case for the transients above y$ in C1 c C+. When the equilibrium moves from Cto C+ (say quasistatically), we expect that the actual system transient would move from C--C+ possibly through the invariant manifold Wreg. But upon the transient reaching the singular surface (the point $ in this simple case), system predictability is lost. By Theorem 6, these results are valid for the general large DAE system E.</p><p>2) Saddle-Node Bifurcation: The saddle-node bifurcation appears on the feasibility boundaries in both control types in Fig. <ref type="figure">10(a)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(b)</ref>. For convenient graphical illustration, we choose the SVC control in Fig. <ref type="figure">10(b</ref>) and consider the parameter value K = 1.5. The local transients near the saddlenode bifurcation segment of the feasibility boundary can be demonstrated as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref>. Note that there exist two equilibria in Fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref>(a) which meet in Fig. <ref type="figure">12(b)</ref> annihilating each other so that there exists no equilibria in Fig. <ref type="figure">12(c</ref>). In all three cases, near the saddle-node feasibility boundary segment, the dynamics on the center manifold C determines the eventual behavior. Specifically after the bifurcation, in Fig. <ref type="figure">12(c</ref>), the trajectories move fast toward C and then slowly diverging along C toward the singularity in Fig. <ref type="figure">12(c)</ref>.</p><p>3) Hopf Bifurcation: Hopf bifurcation (the subcritical type) occurs on the feasibility boundary of the equilibrium I C ~ (%e) in Fig. <ref type="figure">10(a)</ref> [Fig. <ref type="figure">10(b)</ref>]. In this case, since the system dimension is two (n = 2), the center manifold C for Hopf bifurcation is simply the whole state space and there exists no To illustrate the center manifold nature of the local dynamics (such as the fast movement toward C and slow divergence along C in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), the system dimension needs to be at least three, and owing to space limitations, such examples are not presented in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The paper analyzes the local dynamical behavior of large differential-algebraic systems near the three generic local bifurcation segments which are the principal constituents of the feasibility boundaries, namely the saddle-node, Hopf, and the singularity induced bifurcations. Transients near the saddle-node bifurcation segments diverge monotonously while the transients near the Hopf bifurcation boundaries diverge away from the unstable equilibrium in an oscillatory fashion. Transient behavior of the constrained system C cannot be predicted near the singularity induced bifurcation segments. Analytically it is shown that the system may display smooth behavior near the singularity induced bifurcation, yet the actual system behavior will be unpredictable near this bifurcation for the DAE model C . More detailed system models are necessary for further analysis. Bifurcation phenomena connected with global bifurcations and other interior feasibility boundary segments need more investigation for large systems.</p></div>			</div>
