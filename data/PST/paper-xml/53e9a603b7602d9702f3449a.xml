<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recently, Semantic Wikis showed reasonable success as collaboration platforms in the context of social semantic applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach, that interprets the concept of Semantic Wikis as a knowledge engineering environment, that effectively help to build decision-support systems. We introduce the Semantic Wiki KnowWE, that provides the possibility to define and maintain ontologies together with strong problem-solving knowledge. Thus, the wiki can be used to collaboratively build decision-support systems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the last decades, the application of intelligent decisionsupport systems showed their advantages in many domainsexamples of successful uses are described in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. When building such systems, the most critical challenge is the development and maintenance of the knowledge bases. In the past, this challenge has been primarily tackled by the introduction of comprehensive methodologies describing the structured construction and application of the knowledge; examples are Com-monKADS <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, the On-To-Knowledge Methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, DILIGENT <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and the Agile Methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Corresponding tools are often tailored to the specific methodologies, and they usually limit the developer to a specific knowledge representation to be applied when building the system, for example Protégé <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, OntoEdit <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, and KnowME <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>Today's knowledge engineering projects, however, often face the challenge that knowledge is present at different levels of formalization. Knowledge appears in different representations ranging from technical documents, construction plans, sheets, and experiences of human experts, but also in the explicit form of rules and models. Moreover, we see that the problem of knowledge formalization to one specific representation has not been solved sufficiently, i.e., the knowledge acquisition bottleneck still exists today.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Dilemmas of knowledge engineering</head><p>In our opinion and experience over the last years many projects failed because of conflicting options, that we call knowledge engineering dilemmas:</p><p>1. The Single/Multiple Experts Dilemma. The motivation and sophistication of single domain specialists is often the driving force of successful knowledge acquisition and evolution. Although high-quality experts can guarantee the construction of a high-quality knowledge base, these persons are often short in time and endurance. The distribution of the workload over a number of specialists would decrease this problem, but would also increase the risk of reducing the overall quality of the formalized knowledge. Furthermore, the collaboration among a group of specialists is not supported sufficiently in many (industrial) systems concerning the distributed development of a knowledge base. Here, the dilemma exists of favoring a distributed over a monolithic development processinvolving multiple experts instead of a single expert. 2. The Flexibility/Productivity Dilemma. Current state-ofthe-art tools are often tailored to a specific knowledge representation and acquisition interface for developing the knowledge base. In consequence, these tools are not sufficiently flexible to map the mental model of the domain specialists, that are responsible for formalizing the knowledge in the project. Additionally, knowledge appears in diverse representations, such as textual and tabular data, but also, for example, as explicit rules.</p><p>On the one hand, the mapping of the particular mental model of the specialists to the provided knowledge representation and interfaces, respectively, often turned out to be difficult and time-consuming. On the other hand, a tool having the maximal flexibility, regarding the user interfaces and provided knowledge representations, typically would increase the complexity of its use and therefore decreases the productivity of the developers; this principle was also described in general as the Flexibility-Usability Tradeoff <ref type="bibr">[32, p. 86]</ref>. In consequence, we face the dilemma of demanding a tool with maximal flexibility vs. a tool with maximal productivity.</p><p>Certainly, these dilemmas cannot be easily solved, but lightened by the introduction of agile and extensible tools, that adapt to the present situation. We motivate, that an extensible Semantic Wiki is an appropriate basis for building a new generation of knowledge engineering environments. It allows for the integration of knowledge at different levels of formality, and therefore tries to weaken the flexibility/productivity dilemma described above. The use of a Semantic Wiki additionally helps to target the first dilemmathe single/multiple experts dilemma. Due to its open and web-based implementation, a Semantic Wiki naturally allows for the distribution of the development process over a group of domain specialists. Collaboration is supported by many standard features of wikis, for instance distributed editing, versioning, rights management, and discussion pages. However, the dilemmas can only be lightened by providing a technical platform for a collaborative engineering process. Thus, a Semantic Wiki can be easily used within one of the methodologies mentioned above by serving as the primary development tool. For instance, in CommonKADS the documentation of the collected models can be naturally integrated into the system. In collaborative methodologies, such as DILIGENT, the Semantic Wiki can be used to support the agreements and discussions about the development process.</p><p>In this paper, we propose the Semantic Wiki KnowWE as a knowledge engineering environment for decision-support systems. The wiki is extended by the possibility to capture and share strong problem-solving methods for the classification task. Thus, it not only provides interfaces for the engineering of ontologies, but also interfaces for more expressive knowledge such as rules and fault models.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we introduce the wiki KnowWE in more detail: We show its functional organization, and we motivate how strong problem-solving knowledge is integrated into the ontological layer of a Semantic Wiki. We also briefly describe the reasoning architecture of KnowWE. One distinguishing component of KnowWE (in comparison to other Semantic Wikis ) is that it provides textual markups to describe strong problem-solving knowledge for the classification task. Section 3 shows useful markups of KnowWE for the definition of rules, decision trees, and set-covering knowledge in more detail. The system is already used in industrial and scientific projects. We demonstrate the possible use of KnowWE in Sect. 5 by showing the development of a commercial medical decision-support system. The work is concluded with a discussion in Sect. 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Wikis for knowledge engineering</head><p>In the last years, wiki systems have shown their benefits as simple and versatile web-based content-management systems; users can add and modify tacit knowledge in form of text and multimedia in a flexible manner. As the most prominent example, Wikipedia attracts a large number of users, that are willing to create and maintain informal "world knowledge" through the wiki system. While wikis demonstrated their benefits for creating and sharing knowledge in open web environments, they are also successfully used in companies and universities as general knowledge management tools. The key feature of a wiki is its ability to change and refine content in a fairly simple way: Every wiki article is presented in a web browser in the corresponding view mode. The user can easily modify/extend the content of the article by changing into the edit mode of the article, which is usually possible due to a mandatory Edit button placed on the page. After saving the modifications, the changes are directly updated in the view mode.</p><p>Due to their simplicity, standard wiki systems show limitations when actually using the included knowledge. For knowledge retrieval, only a simple full-text search is available, and knowledge connected across different articles cannot be aggregated in a unified manner. This motivated the development of Semantic Wikis <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, that provide the possibility to enrich the wiki content by semantic annotations, thus formulating explicit knowledge. The annotations correspond to ontological concepts, and knowledge reuse is improved by semantic search and semantic navigation. At the same time, Semantic Wikis successfully serve as ontology development tools, that offer a simple and webbased interface to build semantic applications. Current examples of Semantic Wiki implementations are, for instance, IkeWiki <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, KnowWE <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, MoKi <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Semantic Medi-aWiki <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and SweetWiki <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>The knowledge in a Semantic Wiki is typically organized as follows: Every wiki article represents a concept of the ontology, and the content of the article informally describes the concept. Properties of the concept are defined by explicit semantic annotations within the article, where the annotations often link to other articles and concepts, respectively. In general, most Semantic Wiki systems are capable of developing and maintaining ontologies with the expressiveness of a subset of OWL <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Whereas this level of expressiveness is sufficient in many domains, some applications need the integration of knowledge beyond the power of OWL. In our case, the development of (diagnostic) knowledge systems requires the representation of strong problem-solving knowledge, such as (production) rules, decision trees, or fault models. In this section, we introduce the Semantic Wiki KnowWE, that is extended by markups and interfaces to develop and share strong problem-solving knowledge. In consequence, KnowWE can be used as a web-based knowledge engineering tool for building (diagnostic) decision-support systems.</p><p>With the extension of a Semantic Wiki by strong problemsolving methods a number of implications arise:</p><p>-Concerning the internal layers of the system -Representation of the problem-solving knowledge in the semantic layer. -Processing the problem-solving knowledge by extended inference methods. -Concerning the user interface -Interfaces for the acquisition and evolution of problemsolving knowledge. -Appropriate interfaces for using the knowledge.</p><p>In the following, we discuss these implications in more detail, and we show how these issues are mapped to the implementation of the system KnowWE. To the knowledge of the authors, KnowWE is the first implementation of a Semantic Wiki that integrates strong problem-solving knowledge into the wiki context.</p><p>We first motivate the use of the wiki by a small example, and then we discuss the underlying architecture in more detail. Throughout the rest of the paper, we use a simplified diagnosis system for car faults as the running example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">KnowWE by example</head><p>In this section, we introduce the basic features of KnowWE by using a simple example application for diagnosing car faults. The basic idea is, that possible causes of a car faultthe solutions of the problem-are represented by corresponding wiki articles. The wiki contains, for instance, articles about flat battery, clogged air filter, and bad ignition timing.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, a page of the wiki is shown, describing the solution bad ignition timing. Besides standard text describing the problem in more detail, also explicit problem-solving knowledge is included on the page. At Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>-(1), two heuristic rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> of the rule base are displayed, that describe derivation knowledge of the solution. The first rule states, that the solution Bad ignition timing will receive a negative score, if the user enters for the symptom engine start that it neither does not start nor barely starts. A negative score decreases the evaluation score of the solution in the given case. The second rule states the derivation of the solution with respect to observations regarding the engine noises: The solution will receive a positive score, if the engine noise was observed by the user as ringing or knocking. In total, the example rule base for the solution Bad ignition timing comprises 11 rules. Besides the representation of rules, we also allow for the inclusion of model-based knowledge and decision trees; cf. Sect. 3 for more details.</p><p>We see that the derivation knowledge of a solution is locally defined and maintained together with the corresponding article of the solution; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> for an example, where a rule base is edited in the article. This allows for a simplified update of informal (e.g., text) and explicit knowledge (e.g., rules) about one entity.</p><p>Although the wiki is mainly used as a tool for knowledge engineering, it also provides interfaces for interactive problem-solving. We give an example of the problemsolving process in the following: Some parts of the text are related to concepts of the knowledge base, and thus have a meaning for the problem-solving process. Specific semantic annotations relate these text parts with the concepts. In the view mode of the wiki the user is able to click on the annotated text and can enter findings based on the corresponding concept. We call this approach inline answers for problemsolving in wikis. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref><ref type="figure">2</ref>) the text phrase "engine noises" was annotated by the corresponding concept Engine noises available in the knowledge base. In the given example, the value knocking for the concept Engine noises was entered by the user. As we explain in the following sections, the distributed reasoning process of KnowWE enables, that all registered knowledge bases contained in the wiki are notified about this new finding, and suitable states of the solutions are derived. In the solutions pane of the wiki-see Fig. <ref type="figure">1-(</ref>3)-we see that the solution Bad ignition timing is derived with a high certainty, whereas the alternative solution Clogged air filter was also derived and is considered as a possible solution. Both solutions were derived on the basis of this finding and previously entered findings. By click-Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> A wiki article describing the solution bad ignition timing in the context of a car diagnosis application ing on the solution Clogged air filter in the solutions pane, we quickly can navigate to the wiki article describing the corresponding article. In this example, we see that not only the knowledge of the current article is used for problemsolving, but all knowledge bases in the wiki contribute to this process.</p><p>Alternatively, the user is able to download an executable version of the knowledge base by clicking the download button, see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref><ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref>). Then, the knowledge base of the article is provided as download in the d3web format. The system d3web is a freely available runtime engine written as opensource toolkit; see SourceForge <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for more details. This way, the knowledge bases can be developed using the wiki and can be exported later to an external application if required.</p><p>In the following sections, we describe the underlying processes of creating and using knowledge bases within the Semantic Wiki KnowWE. First, we show how parts of the wiki article are compiled into executable knowledge bases. Second, we discuss the representation of the knowledge in the ontology layer of the wiki, and we finally sketch the distributed reasoning process, that enables the derivation of solutions over the entire wiki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Transformation of wiki articles to knowledge bases</head><p>Usually, Semantic Wikis formalize one ontology that is distributed over the wiki: Every concept is represented by one distinct wiki article and properties between the concepts are usually defined by semantic annotations within the wiki articles.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> After saving a wiki article, the knowledge is transformed and compiled into an executable format. The wiki repository holds the compiled knowledge bases together with the application ontology, the original wiki articles, and the general task ontology For the development of problem-solving knowledge we extend this approach by a slightly more distributed architecture. When saving the currently edited article, the content is saved as a standard wiki page. Semantic annotationsincluded in the text-are identified and the domain ontology is updated accordingly. Additionally, dedicated parsers process the problem-solving knowledge found in the text into an executable knowledge base. We discuss specific markups in more detail in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>.</p><p>With this workflow, every concept of the ontology is represented by a distinct wiki article. However, the problemsolving knowledge related to this concept is externalized to a compiled knowledge base. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the described workflow is depicted, showing that an article is stored in the wiki repository in multiple ways: First, the repository saves the raw article in the Wiki Articles section of the repository (Fig. <ref type="figure">2-1</ref>). Second, ontological concepts and properties, included in the article by semantic annotations, are stored/updated in the Application Ontology (Fig. <ref type="figure">2-2</ref>). The compilation of the problem-solving knowledge contained in the article is filed to the Knowledge Bases section of the repository (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>). The foundational layer of all represented knowledge is the Task Ontology, that is used to connect the described concepts and the problem-solving knowledge elements. The functioning of the task ontology is described in the next section.</p><p>We see, that the knowledge is redundantly stored as original text in the article repository, as ontological concepts in the application ontology repository, and as compiled knowledge base in the knowledge base repository. That way, we provide the knowledge in all formats that are required by the particular reasoners. For example, we use OWLIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for OWL reasoning and the d3web engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for processing the problem-solving knowledge. This redundant storage of the data and knowledge, respectively, helps to effectively use it for the later tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">A task ontology for problem-solving knowledge</head><p>The foundation of all wiki articles is the task ontology: Here, the fundamental concepts of a Semantic Wiki integrating problem-solving knowledge are represented; examples are the relations between ontological concepts and text paragraphs in articles, but also principle concepts of the problem-solving task, such as user input, solution, and the connecting property derives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Fundamental concepts of the task ontology</head><p>The task ontology of KnowWE is the foundation of the system, since it represents the general entities of all applications built with the system. For example, it includes the definitions of findings and solutions, that are the basic elements of a problem-solving task, i.e., findings are used to derive particular solutions.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> shows the most important concepts of the task ontology: As the key concept Finding holds a Value, that is assigned to an Input. Different inputs are structured into meaningful groups by the concept Questionnaire. Besides text and date inputs, the two main subclasses of Input are Choice Input and Numeric Input; they define attributes with discrete (named) values and numerical value ranges, respectively. An appropriate class of values for every input is defined by subclassing the concept Value, accordingly. The concept Solution denotes a special type of Choice Input in the hierarchy of inputs. The state of a solution is represented by a discrete finite value domain (Solution Value ); its current value is not entered by the user but derived by problem-solving knowledge. The value range of a solution is restricted to one of the individuals Established, Suggested, Undefined, and Excluded. Further, the appropriate subclasses of Value are restricted to the corresponding Input subclasses; for instance, a Solution Value is restricted to be assigned only to instances of Solution concepts. Similarly, Numeric Values are assigned to Numeric Inputs. These and further property restrictions were omitted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> in order to obtain a better overview of the basic concepts. We discuss these restrictions in more detail in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Interweaving the task ontology and the application ontology</head><p>For a new knowledge engineering project the domain specialist defines the basic concepts (findings and solutions), that are relevant for the application domain. Ontological knowledge can be defined by semantic annotations included in the wiki article. When saving an article, the included concepts (together with corresponding properties) are stored in the application ontology or-when already existing-are updated accordingly. For instance, input concepts of the application ontology are automatically aligned as subclasses of Input and Value, respectively. Analogously, solutions of the domain are described as subclasses of Solution. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the task ontology (in orange rounded rectangles) extended by parts of an application ontology for the car diagnosis domain (in blue rectangles). We see that the concepts Clogged air filter and Flat battery are added as children to the concept Technical problem, which itself is a subclass of Solution. Also, the concept Exhaust fumes is defined as a choice input together with a corresponding concept Exhaust fumes values, that represent its possible value domain.</p><p>As we describe in Sect. 3, we provide explicit markups to define concepts of the application ontology. Thus, we are able to automatically align application concepts, specified in an article, as subclasses of an concept of the task ontology.</p><p>For example, the concept Exhaust fumes is automatically aligned as a subclass of Choice Input. The interweaving of the task ontology with the application ontology is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> in more detail. As described before, the property assignedTo between Value and Input is restricted in subclasses of both concepts. Thus, for instances of Choice Value only instances of Choice Input can be connected by the property assignedTo. During the construction of the application ontology, these restrictions are driven even further: For example, an instance of the concept Exhaust fumes values is limited to be assigned only to instances of the concept Exhaust fumes. In this manner, the particular values can be only assigned to the appropriate inputs. Further, we limit the alternatives of possible values for Choice Inputs by using a closed class for the corresponding Value concept: Only black, blue, and invisible are allowed as instances of the concept Exhaust fumes values. The use of universal quantification and closed classes guarantees only reasonable instances of a Finding concept during a problem-solving session. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> It is important to notice, that the described ontological assertions between the task ontology and the application ontology are created/updated by the parsers when processing a modified wiki article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Problem-solving sessions</head><p>The wiki allows for concurrent problem-solving by many users. Then, a distinct instance of PSSession is assigned to each user. The structure of the problem-solving process is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref> by an example: A concrete problemsolving session (here with the name user1 ) is represented by an instance of the concept PSSession. Facts, entered by the user, are mapped to created instances of Finding (Value instances assigned to Input instances); derived solutions are represented as instances of solution values assigned to a specific instance of Solution. Currently, the system mostly utilizes external reasoners (rule engines, model-based systems, etc.) to derive solutions; due to a broker the state of externally derived solutions is synchronized with the Solution instances of the corre-sponding PSSession instance (see Sect. 2.4 for more details). The reasoning processes of different users are independent from each other, since every user is represented by a distinct instance of PSSession. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref> an example is given for the session instance user1: The problemsolving session instantiated two findings entered by the user (Exhaust fumes=black and Fuel=unleaded). Also, one solution was derived, that is represented by the instance Clogged air filter = Established. It is worth noticing, that for each fact a new instance only for the concept Finding is created; the actual input and value concepts are statically used as singletons. Related approaches The use of different layers for taskspecific and domain-specific knowledge is commonly suggested in the knowledge engineering research. Studer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> give an overview of principles and methods, that follow this distinction, for instance the Expertise Model of Com-monKADS <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> or the ontology layers of Protégé-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. More recently, Crubezy and Musen <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> propose a similar approach: Here a method ontology specifies the required inputs/outputs of the problem-solving method and a domain ontology holds the application-specific knowledge. When compared to our approach, their use of the method ontology and domain ontology can be mapped to the task ontology and application ontology, respectively. Their framework, however, provides more flexibility due to the use of a separate mapping ontology. Whereas our approach automatically connects the concepts of the task ontology with the application ontology, these links are defined explicitly by a mapping ontology in their approach. In consequence, our approach requires less efforts due to the automatic alignment of the concepts, but limits the knowledge acquisition to diagnostic reasoning.</p><p>In the following section, we describe how new facts are derived by problem-solving knowledge, and how new derivations are mapped to new instances of Finding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Distributed inference</head><p>The distributed inference system of the wiki processes facts between the user and the available knowledge bases. New facts are added to the application ontology either in the form of findings entered by the user or due to solutions that are derived by knowledge bases. Every time, a new finding is entered by the user, the entry is mapped to a newly created instance of Finding. The new finding instance is stored in the application ontology, and a propagation of this new fact is started through the alignment service of the wiki. The alignment service maps the facts to corresponding entities, that are included in the knowledge bases. For example, the instance Exhaust fumes = black is mapped to the corresponding knowledge base object Exhaust fumes, that has the possible value black.</p><p>Based on this alignment the new fact is propagated to all registered knowledge bases. Some knowledge bases are able to use this fact to derive new facts, that are again propagated to the broker for further distribution. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref> this distributed reasoning process is depicted.</p><p>That way, entered findings are not only processed by the knowledge base of the currently open wiki article, but also by all existing knowledge bases of the wiki. Therefore, all solutions-that are represented in the wiki-can be derived anytime as it was motivated in Sect. 2.1.</p><p>Although this reasoning process is simple, its effectiveness depends on the quality of the alignment service. Currently, we implement a simple alignment of ontology concepts based on their naming and structure, i.e., concepts of the knowledge bases with the same name and the same value range are mapped to each other as equivalent classes. In the literature, however, more powerful approaches are described <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. These can be added easily to the KnowWE system when required. Distributed reasoning offers a number of benefits when compared to a traditional monolithic problemsolving process: Due to the use of a collection of individual knowledge bases, the addition, modification, and exchange of single knowledge bases becomes easier. In principle, this architecture also allows for a spatially distributed reasoning process, i.e., the knowledge bases are situated on different, locally distributed servers.</p><p>However, in the context of knowledge engineering for decision-support systems it is often reasonable to control the problem-solving behavior of the edited knowledge bases. Thus, KnowWE provides the possibility to define a specific article as the master of the wiki: Here, a large coherent knowledge base is defined on the basis of imports of knowledge bases contained in other wiki articles. This master can be separately tested and exported as a single knowledge base. Further, we are able to define variants of knowledge bases by defining different masters importing varying collections of wiki articles. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>, an example of two </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Knowledge acquisition with textual markups</head><p>The knowledge acquisition interface always strongly depends on the problem-solving engine and knowledge representation used. KnowWE provides multiple markups to define problem-solving knowledge inline with the text, a mapping of the entered knowledge to the application ontology, and an integration of the reasoning results into the ontology and wiki interface (e.g., for showing derived solutions to the user). We integrated the open-source reasoning engine d3web <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> into the wiki, since it implements multiple reasoners for diagnostic inference and allows for a flexible adaptation of the knowledge engineering process with respect to the project requirements. As described in Sect. 2.3, the reasoning engine takes Finding instances from the application ontology and writes derived solutions/findings into the ontology again.</p><p>Due to the extensible architecture of KnowWE, it is possible to add further engines besides d3web, such as Prolog or JESS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>; the architecture of the wiki was described in more detail in Reutelshoefer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>In the following, we introduce markups to define terminological concepts, rules, decision trees, and set-covering models. The syntax of the particular markups should be as simple as possible in order to allow for an intuitive creation and evolution of the knowledge together with the standard wiki text. In the best case, motivated wiki users are capable of understanding and using the markup with only little training. With this ability, we enable an ad-hoc knowledge engineering process <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>For an effective use, we propose to seamlessly integrate the acquisition of problem-solving knowledge into the standard authoring process of the wiki. For this reason, we embed the knowledge formalization into the edit pane of the wiki article, i.e., specialized textual markup is used to enter explicit knowledge inline with the wiki text. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> shows an example, where a rule base is included in the wiki article: Besides standard wiki markup for defining the content of text and images (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9-(1)</ref>), also a rule base for deriving the solution Clogged air filter is included, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9-(2)</ref>.</p><p>It is possible to structure the wiki by solutions, i.e., each solution or group of related solutions defines a distinct wiki article. Besides standard wiki text and multimedia concerning the solutions, we also recommend including the corresponding problem-solving knowledge in the articles. The definition of the terminology is an exceptional case; here, we propose to define the possible inputs and their structure on a page, that is different from the pages describing its solution's derivation knowledge. That way, every article of a new solution can reuse the terminology for describing the problemsolving knowledge. Additional inputs-proprietary for a specific solution-can be either added ad-hoc on the solution's page or (after consulting the wiki admin) added to the distinct terminology page. Analogously, the taxonomy of solutions can be defined on a special page. Otherwise, every solution-not connected into a taxonomy-is added as direct subclass of the concept Solution, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Terminology definition</head><p>In the previous section, we introduced the concept of the application ontology, that describes the basic entities of the considered domain. As for all other types of knowledge, the application ontology is defined within the edit pane of the wiki. We provide two hierarchies to define the elementary facts of the diagnostic task: (User) inputs and solutions. Both hierarchies are defined by so-called dash-trees. A dash-tree is a textual notation of a tree, where the successors of a node Above, two hierarchies are depicted as dash trees. In fact, we see that the dash-trees give an excerpt of the application ontology already shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The left side shows an input-tree, where inputs along with their values are defined. As required in the task ontology, inputs are grouped into questionnaires, and thus the root of every input tree denotes the name of the questionnaire the inputs are referring to. In the example, Observations is defined as a questionnaire containing the inputs Fuel, Exhaust fumes, Current fuel consumption, and Average fuel consumption. The first input Fuel is defined with the values unleaded and diesel. The marker [oc] denotes, that this input is defined as a Choice Input, i.e., an input with a discrete value range, where only one value can hold at a time. Analogously, the inputs Current fuel consumption and Average fuel consumption are defined as Numerical Input by the marker <ref type="bibr">[num]</ref>.</p><p>The right side of the markup example shows the definition of the solution taxonomy. With Technical problem as the root solution, we define is-a relations to other solutions by dashes. For instance, the solutions Clogged air filter and Battery problem are subclasses of Technical problem, whereas Battery problem has the two subclasses Flat battery and Defect battery cell. Since Technical problem is not connected as the child of another solution, it is automatically sub-classed by the concept Solution by default, see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. We see, that the dashes have different semantics for the input trees and the solutions trees; they represent the most common organization property for each hierarchy (contains vs. subClassOf).</p><p>The terminology of inputs and solutions can be defined anywhere in the wiki article, but both trees have to be wrapped by the tag %% Questions ...% and %%Solutions ...%, respectively, so that the system can identify the explicit terminology definitions. In the following sections, we introduce markups to define problem-solving knowledge, that is used to derive solutions based on given values of inputs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Semantic annotations</head><p>In KnowWE, semantic annotations are defined inline with the wiki text. The markup for those annotations was inspired by the syntax of Semantic MediaWiki <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and ontological concepts can be simply linked by the definition of ontological properties. The general syntax of the markup connects a text phrase of the wiki text with a concept using an ontological property.</p><p>[Bad ignition timing is a technical problem &lt;=&gt; subClassOf:: TechnicalProblem] that can be solved... In the example shown above, the text phrase "Bad ignition. . . problem" is annotated, stating, that the concept represented by this article is a subClassOf the concept TechnicalProblem-the relation is also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The annotation itself states, that the annotated text phrase documents/justifies the given relation.</p><p>By this type of annotation many useful ontological relations can be defined inline the wiki text. All annotations are represented in the application ontology and can be queried using a SPARQL <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> endpoint. SPARQL queries are embedded into the wiki text, and the results of the queries are shown in the view mode of the article.</p><p>Moreover, inline annotations also are used to define user inputs facilities. When using the asks annotation, the wiki renders access points to enter facts at the defined place. For example, the following annotation shows an excerpt of the edit pane corresponding to the wiki article shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>!! Typical Symptoms</head><p>Bad ignition timing can have multiple symptoms: For example, ... or weak acceleration. Furthermore, bad ignition timing frequently causes [engine noises &lt;=&gt; asks:: Engine noises], such as ringing or knocking.</p><p>In the second-last line, we see that the text phrase "engine noises" is annotated by the property asks with the concept Engine noises as value. This annotation yields the popup menu shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where the user can enter a new finding instance related to the concept Engine noises.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Rules</head><p>KnowWE provides a specialized markup for the definition of rule-based knowledge. Rules are certainly the most popular knowledge representation for building knowledge bases. A rule r = r.c ⇒ r.a derives facts as defined in its consequent (rule action) r.a, if the specified rule condition r.c is satisfied. Facts derived by the rule can be interpreted as solutions, or as further inputs, that are used in conditions of other rules. The rule condition r.c typically consists of a combination of conjunctions and/or disjunctions constraining the values of inputs. For the sake of simplicity, we distinguish two basic types of rules, that can be used in the wiki:</p><p>1. abstraction rules for deriving new instances of findings, and 2. scoring rules for deriving a new state of a solution instance.</p><p>Abstraction rules simply define an input in their rule action, that is assigned by either a pre-defined value (for choice inputs) or is assigned by a numeric value. The numeric value can be either a static real value or can be computed by a formula given in the rule action.</p><p>In scoring rules we use scores to qualitatively derive solutions with a symbolic confirmation weight. These weights state the degree of confirmation or disconfirmation of a particular solution. Thus, a symbolic weight expresses the strength, for which the satisfied rule condition will confirm/disconfirm the solution. The definition and semantics of scoring rules goes back to the INTERNIST/QMR project <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and the D3 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Analogous to the representation of the d3web rule system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> we distinguish seven positive weights (P1, . . . , P7) and seven negative weights (N1, . . . , N7). Here, the weight P7 stands for the categoric derivation of a solution, the counter-weight N7 yields the categoric exclusion of a solution. The remaining weights are defined in a way, so that the aggregation of two equal weights results in the weight of the next higher weight, e.g., N3 + N3 = N4; two equal weights with opposite sign nullify, e.g., N3 + P3 = 0.</p><p>Due to the textual acquisition within wikis, the readability and intuitiveness of the markup is crucial for the effectivity of its application. Therefore, we decided to not use an already existing standardized markup for (horn clause) rules like RIF <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref> or the languages SWRL/RuleML <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, but to promote a more compact and human-readable notation. In the following example two rules in the proposed markup are given: The abstraction rule r1 derives the fuel consumption with respect to the usual fuel consumption in percent. Here, the value is computed by a formula including the values for Average fuel consumption and Current fuel consumption. The scoring rule r2 adds the weight P4 to the score of the solution Clogged air filter, if the user instance of Fuel Evaluation exceeds the value 140. Rules can be defined anywhere in the wiki article, but every coherent group of rules has to be wrapped by %%Rules ...%, so that the system scans this section for rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Decision trees</head><p>The representation of classification knowledge using decision trees is very popular in machine learning research <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, but is also widely used for the manual definition of decisionsupport knowledge. The markup for the decision tree is very similar to the markup of the input terminology, as introduced in Sect. 3.1. The paths of the decision tree are represented by dashes indenting the particular inputs and values. Moreover, a decision tree also defines successors of input values to express, that the specified inputs are asked in case the input value was entered into the system.</p><p>The following example shows a simplistic decision tree for the derivation of a clogged air filter. Internally, decision trees are represented by questionnaires, so Check air filter is the questionnaire corresponding to the decision tree. The first question of the decision tree is related to the input Fuel, where the next input Exhaust fumes is asked when the instance Fuel = unleaded is present. If the follow-up input Exhaust pipe color then is answered with the value black, the solution Clogged air filter is derived with the value established; the categorical derivation is specified by the (!) annotation. Alternatively, scores-like introduced for scoring rules-can also be used (Sect. 3.3). If these scoring weights are used instead of the categoric derivation, then we call the tree a heuristic decision tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>It is important to notice, that one decision tree can call other decision trees in its leafs instead of-or in addition to-deriving a solution. For example, the decision tree Check diesel problems is called, if the instance Fuel = diesel is present. The activation of other decision trees allows for the modularization of larger knowledge bases.</p><p>Also, decision trees do not only define knowledge for the derivation of knowledge, but also specify an interview strategy for a dialog with the user: Possible values of an input are denoted in an extra line of the markup. If such a value is followed by a user input with an indent increased by one, then this input is interpreted as a follow-up input to be presented, when the previous input was answered with the given value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Check air filter -Fuel [oc] --unleaded ---Exhaust fumes [oc] ----black -----Exhaust pipe color [oc] ------black -------Clogged air filter (!) ------grey ----blue ----invisible --diesel ---Check diesel problems</head><p>Check diesel problems -Age of your car (in years) [num] --&gt; 10 ---... --&lt;= 10 ---... Decision trees with the shown size are very easy to understand and to maintain. For larger decision trees, however, it is recommended to partition the tree logic into a set of sub-trees and refer to these sub-trees from a main tree. For example, the two decision trees from above-Check air filter and Check diesel problems-are refining trees, that are called from a main tree. The main tree itself is responsible for locating the coarse problem field and calling appropriate sub-trees.</p><p>Decision tree knowledge can be defined on arbitrary places in the wiki article, but they have to be wrapped by the terminology markup %%Questions ...%.</p><p>Since trees can be easily formulated using XML, it would have been an obvious approach to also represent the decision tree by an XML structure. Although this would yield a reduced compilation effort due to the existence of wellestablished XML parsers, the resulting markup appears to be too verbose and complex for standard wiki users. In contrast, the proposed markup is by far more compact and less vulnerable to syntax errors made by the user when formulating the decision tree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Set-covering models</head><p>Decision trees and rule-based knowledge-as introduced above-consider the deductive derivation of solutions, which is common for the definition of classification knowledge. In some domains, however, it is preferable to use an abductive approach to formalize the derivation knowledge. Setcovering models <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> are a prominent example of an abductive knowledge representation. Albeit their basic representation is fairly simple, such models can be incrementally refined in order to improve the expressiveness of the knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The definition of the knowledge is very compact: Solutions are described by a group of findings, that are typically observed when the solution is present. We call these findings the expected findings of a solution. During the problemsolving process the best-matching solution is derived, i.e., the solution that computes the largest intersection between its expected findings and the currently present findings.</p><p>For the use of set-covering models in wikis we propose the application of set-covering lists. For each solution a collection of findings is defined, that are typically observed/entered when the solution is appropriate; the findings are enclosed in braces. The following example shows a setcovering list for the solution Clogged air filter: Typical user inputs are listed, that are expected to be observed for the solution Clogged air filter, e.g., for unleaded gasoline we expect a black exhaust fume and pipe. A special markup is used with [--] in the last line of the list: This annotation states, that the solution is excluded from the derivation, if the given finding is observed, i.e., the color of exhaust fumes is not black.</p><p>The lists can be defined anywhere in the wiki article, but they have to be wrapped by the tag %%SetCoveringList ...%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Design and evolution of textual markups</head><p>In the previous sections, we briefly introduced the possibility to define the terminology, rules, decision trees, and set-covering knowledge. KnowWE provides extended syntax to refine these types of knowledge, but also offers further markups, e.g., for the definition of decision tables. We refer the interested reader to the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> for a more detailed discussion of available markups. In general, new markups and corresponding problem-solving knowledge can be easily added due to the plug-in architecture of KnowWE.</p><p>The markups-as presented in this article-underwent a continuous evolution in the past, where the system was used in case studies with students building toy systems. We observed typical errors and misunderstandings of the (little trained) users when applying the markup for building their knowledge bases. According to the identified issues we gradually refined and simplified the markups to their current state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Management and evaluation of knowledge bases</head><p>Up to that point, we described the concept of wiki-based knowledge engineering and we introduced suitable markups to define strong problem-solving knowledge. For the application of realistic knowledge engineering projects the management and evaluation of knowledge are critical issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Management</head><p>In the experienced development projects the size of the team was usually very small, ranging from 2 to 8 persons. Thus, a strict management approach was not necessary. In general, many projects developing strong problem-solving knowledge do not grow to a size that is greater than 5 people, and dedicated process models may complicate the overall task. With a growing team size, however, the implementation of project management rules becomes important, as they are known in ontology engineering, e.g., DILIGENT <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, in open-source software engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and in general design <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Independently from the team size, the specification of user roles during the project is helpful. In recent projects, a typical four-fold classification of roles was natural: Domain specialists, knowledge engineers, wiki champions, and users. Of course, for some persons some of the roles overlap. Here, domain specialists create and maintain the knowledge base together with the knowledge engineers, that provide support regarding its formalization and structure. The overall structure and evolution of the system is monitored by a wiki champion. The champion bears responsibility for the definition of the master articles and their quality, the deletion of pages, and the management of wiki contributors (creation and exclusion of wiki users). The definition of access rights for the particular user roles is supported by the built-in rights management of standard wiki software. In KnowWE rights are granted for read and write on page level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation</head><p>Suitable evaluation methods heavily depend on the applied knowledge representation and the degree of formalization. In general, the characteristics of knowledge-as presented here-are special as to the following aspects:</p><p>1. Knowledge is distributed as fragments over the wiki articles. Different fragments may be owned by different persons. 2. The formalization degree of knowledge can vary between the particular fragments. 3. Different variants of the knowledge base are assembled by the definition of different master articles (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>).</p><p>In such a setting, it is not reasonable to jointly evaluate the knowledge of the entire wiki, but to run separate evaluations on the respective masters defined in the wiki. For each master, we commonly expect the knowledge to be at a uniform formalization level-an assumption that we cannot make for other variants of the knowledge.</p><p>For the validation of the knowledge, we provide a plugin for empirical test runs, i.e., the execution of (sequential) test cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> shows a screenshot of the empirical testing plugin of KnowWE, where 100 test cases of the Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> Empirical testing with test cases in KnowWE; the results of the executed test cases can be visualized by DDTrees car diagnosis domain have successfully passed with a precision/recall of 1. A generated visualization of the test results can be also downloaded and used for manual inspection (as show on the right top of Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>). Test cases can be defined within the wiki and are executed together with a predefined master knowledge base. The verification of knowledge checks for inconsistency and other types of anomalies. Currently, KnowWE does not offer a built-in verification of the specified masters, but masters can be exported as knowledge bases. These knowledge bases are then verified using the workbench KnowME <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, that offers a variety of anomaly testing tools and uses the same file format for knowledge bases. Certainly, the tight integration of verification methods into the wiki is planned for future work, where also distributed methods are implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Case study: the Digitalys CareMate system</head><p>The system is currently used in a number of (partly industrial, partly academic) projects, ranging from simple recommender systems to complex decision-support systems for technical and medical devices.</p><p>For example, KnowWE provides a technical platform to support a biological community within the BIOLOG Wissen<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> project (formerly LaDy). BIOLOG Wissen <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> serves as a web-based application for the collaborative construction and use of a decision-support system for landscape diversity. It aims to integrate knowledge on causal dependencies of stakeholders, relevant statistical data, and multi-media content. In another recent project, KnowWE is extended by diagnostic workflow knowledge in the context of the CliWE project. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> By this extension, the wiki is used to collaboratively develop clinical guidelines, that are integrated as compiled knowledge bases into next-generation medical devices. A first prototype of this extension is reported in Hatko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we describe the medical decision-support system Digitalys CareMate, that is currently maintained using the Semantic Wiki KnowWE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Medical decision support with CareMate</head><p>The decision support system Digitalys CareMate is commercially sold by the company Digitalys<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> as part of an equipment kit for medical rescue trucks. It is used as a consultation system during medical rescue missions, when the problem definition of a particular rescue service is complex and a second opinion becomes important.</p><p>The major goals of the project were the rated derivation of suitable solutions and the implementation of an efficient interview technique for busy rescue service staff in the emergency car. Thus, the user can be guided through an interview focussing on relevant questions of the current problem. With more questions answered the current ranking of possible solutions improves in relevance, and the interview strategy targets the presentation of reasonable follow-up questions. The interview strategy follows official school guidelines for emergency medical technicians in Germany.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Structure and engineering of the knowledge base</head><p>In the context of the CateMate project one of the most prominent assets of a (Semantic) Wiki was its freedom to structure the knowledge base. Thus, a wiki does not impose any restrictions on how to organize the knowledge base over the wiki articles. In this spirit, KnowWE also does not limit the developers with respect to the knowledge structure. For this reason, it became necessary to decide about the structuring of the CareMate knowledge at the beginning of the project. In the past, we experienced it to be natural at first to identify the core entities of the application domain; in a second step we try to structure the knowledge base according to instances of the identified entities.</p><p>For the CareMate project, the core entities are the cardinal symptoms, i.e., coarse findings describing vaguely the problem of the currently examined patient. The organization according to the cardinal symptoms is motivated by the observation, that in practice the emergency staff also tries to divide the problem by first identifying the cardinal symptom. Subsequently, the applicable domain knowledge can be easily partitioned with respect to the cardinal symptoms. The domain specialist provided the domain knowledge (interview strategy and solution derivation/rating) for each cardinal symptom in form of MS-Visio diagrams.</p><p>Each cardinal symptom is represented by a distinct wiki article, where-in the first step-the MS-Visio diagrams are uploaded as attachments and documentation/explanation is added as free text in the corresponding wiki articles. In the second step, the knowledge is formalized stepwise using the knowledge formalization pattern heuristic decision tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>; the markup for decision trees was introduced in Sect. 3.4. The use of heuristic decision trees was appropriate, since the dialog logic and the derivation behavior-as described in the MS-Visio diagrams-could be easily transcribed into a decision tree logic. An intermediate rating of solutions during the interview was possible, since heuristic decision trees allow for a scoring of solutions not only at the end of a dialog, but also in between the tree paths.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">11</ref> shows a screenshot of the main screen of the CareMate development environment. We see entry points for the 10 cardinal symptoms ("Leitsymptome"), for instance neurological problems ("Neurologie"), chest pain ("Schmerzen im Brustkorb"), and disturbed consciousness ("Bewusstseinstrübung und Bewusstlosigkeit"). Each cardinal symptom defines a decision tree that can be branched into subsequent decision trees. In their leafs, some trees link to other cardinal symptoms, when the interview progression shows, that another cardinal symptom is more relevant for the diagnostic process. A sophisticated interview strategy is implemented within the tree, so that an effective diagnosis can be made.</p><p>Thus, the wiki article of every cardinal symptom contains free text with documentation and explanations, the original knowledge source in form of MS-Visio diagrams, and the formalized knowledge fragment. For larger cardinal symptoms, there are further pages linked from the original article, where modular parts of the decision tree are formalized. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12</ref> the wiki article of the cardinal symptom stomach pain ("Bauchschmerzen") is shown. Here, the wiki text describes that the decision tree logic was divided into two decision trees handling the diagnosis of stomach pain for women and for men, separately. For both decision trees an image is shown (can be enlarged on click), that gives an overview of the general structure of the questionnaire and the inference. The lower part of the browser window also shows an excerpt of the formalized knowledge base, where first the sex ("Geschlecht") of the patient is asked.</p><p>Whereas the semi-formalized specification of the workflows as MS-Visio diagrams took several weeks, the stepwise formalization as heuristic decision trees was done within some days. The developed knowledge base was validated and verified using the DDTree visualization approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The wiki-based validation using test cases and its corresponding verification using the DDTree visualization is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>.</p><p>At the current state of development, the knowledge base contains about 260 findings distributed over 33 questionnaires. There are about 145 distinct solutions represented by the system, where their derivation is logically organized by 10 cardinal symptoms. The compiled knowledge base resulted in a (merged) decision tree having 2051 possible diagnostic paths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Export for a runtime version</head><p>Since, the knowledge base is running in a touch-screen application on a rough-sized notepad, releases of the knowl-edge base need to be exported from the wiki into the runtime. Therefore, we provide a deployment feature in KnowWE, where-on a separate wiki page-a number of paragraphs of other wiki articles can be defined, that should be integrated into a compile process. More technically, we define paragraphs of wiki articles, that should be included into this new wiki article. By including the relevant parts of the knowledge definitions spread over the wiki, we are able to define a view of the entire knowledge base on this one wiki page. This join of knowledge bases was introduced as masters of the wiki previously in Sect. 2.4. The compiled knowledge base of this master article is exported for external use.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> shows a screenshot of the runtime application running the CareMate knowledge base. The center pane of the screen shows the currently active input to be answered by the user; previously answered inputs are automatically scrolled on top. In the bottom pane of the system, an ordered list of possible solutions is displayed. The list is updated incrementally when new findings are entered into the system. Since the application is installed on touchscreen tablet computers, the size of the buttons is increased appropriately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Reflections on the benefits of using a Semantic Wiki</head><p>Semantic Wikis became prominent because of their support of community-driven knowledge engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. In a community-driven knowledge engineering approach, many people contribute to the distributed knowledge base.</p><p>Whereas this approach fits especially for general domains, for instance travel <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, this may not always work in more specialized domains such as medical or biological science. Consequently, the presented project was traditionally developed by a single domain specialist as the principal knowledge contributor and another specialist for reviewing the knowledge base. The more specialized a knowledge base is, the more advantages of a principal contributor exist. Often, the development of medical knowledge bases follows this approach, where a dedicated domain specialist or a small group of experts formalize their expertise in a particular domain.</p><p>Nevertheless, even for traditional development processes the use of Semantic Wikis supporting problem-solving Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> Screenshot of the runtime application running the CareMate knowledge base. The center shows an auto-scrolling sequence of suitable inputs to be answered by the user. Current inputs are "Pain in a leg?" ("Schmerzen in einem Bein?") and "Bilateral respiratory sound?"

The bottom pane shows an incrementally updated list of possible solutions, here with spontaneous pneumothorax ("Spontanpneumothorax") as the currently most probable solution. Due to the intended use of a touchscreen tablet the size of the buttons is enlarged (original screenshot depicted in German language) knowledge is superior when compared to classic development environments. We sketch some of the advantages in the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Flexible organization of the knowledge: A Semantic</head><p>Wiki provides articles as logical organization units. In a particular project the wiki makes no restrictions on how to fill this logical units and allows for any possible structure as long as it fits a partitioning into articles. In the presented project, we used the cardinal symptoms of the domain (neurological problems, chest pain, etc.) as the logical structure. This partitioning was reasonable with respect to the applied knowledge representation; we defined one or more heuristic decision trees for each cardinal symptom. In another project, the partitioning with respect to solutions can be more appropriate, i.e., defining an article for each solution, where the problem-solving knowledge for this solution is also embedded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Interweaving explicit and tacit knowledge:</head><p>In comparison to standard development tools for knowledge systems, a Semantic Wiki offers a simple combination of explicit knowledge, such as rules or decision trees, with tacit knowledge, for example text and images. Additional information represented in the wiki article can serve in many ways: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> as startup document at the beginning of a project to informally collect knowledge about the domain, (2) as documentation of the knowledge engineering decisions taken, (3) as underlying tacit knowledge expressing the informal counter-part, and (4) as pursuing information for concepts represented by the article. In our project, the knowledge base was originally defined using MS-Visio documents. After the formalization, the documents were attached as underlying tacit knowledge explaining the decision tree representation in an alternative way. The files can be easily attached, and new versions of the documents do not overwrite older ones, but nicely integrate due to the automatic version control of the wiki. Thus, older versions can be reviewed and compared to the current state at any time. Moreover, the articles incorporated an informal documentation of the development process. 3. Simple administration and rights management: Many development tools require the installation of proprietary software on the client-side. With the use of a Semantic Wiki only a standard web-browser and an internet/intranet connection is necessary to start with the development process. Furthermore, this ability frees the knowledge engineers from the dependency of a particular computer; the development can be stopped and continued on any computer with a web-browser and an internet connection. Also, wikis provide a build-in rights management by default, that allows to restrict the read/write access of specific articles to a user or user group. Thus, parts of the wiki can be closed for the public, for example, because the knowledge engineering work is not finished there. Also, any content-knowledge or data-is held under version control, and thus changes and revisions can be safely performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>Intelligent systems demonstrated their successful application in many domains. The costs of building and maintaining such systems, however, are still a critical problem. In this paper, we identified two dilemmas, that often prevent successful knowledge engineering projects: The single/multiple domain specialists dilemma and the flexibility/productivity dilemma.</p><p>We claim that a flexible Semantic Wiki tailored to knowledge engineering tasks can help to relax these dilemmas. The paper introduced the Semantic Wiki KnowWE, which is an extended interpretation of standard Semantic Wikis by also providing the possibility to represent and use strong problem-solving knowledge for classification tasks. We showed, how classification knowledge is integrated into the semantic layer of the wiki, and we described the combined reasoning process of the ontology with the problemsolving knowledge. Integral components of KnowWE are the markups to represent variants of classification knowledge such as rules, decision trees, and set-covering models. The textual markups are embedded into the standard wiki text to formalize the problem-solving knowledge. We provided alternative formats and knowledge representations, respectively, to be able to flexibly adapt to possible project requirements. Technically, KnowWE was built on top of the wiki clone JSPWiki (http://www.jspwiki.org).</p><p>Besides classification problems, further classes of knowledge systems exist addressing, for instance, configuration and scheduling. When adapting the presented approach to tasks other than classification, we need to consider customizing the task ontology (Sect. 2.3) and the markups for the particular problem-solving knowledge (Sect. 3.3ff) together with an appropriate reasoning engine.</p><p>The system is used in some industrial and scientific projects; we demonstrated the application of the wiki by the engineering process of the Digitalys CareMate system-a medical decision-support system for emergency units. We discussed the use of a Semantic Wiki with respect to traditional development processes and we identified a number of advantages in comparison to classic development environments.</p><p>In the future, the evaluation and the evolution of knowledge in Semantic Wikis need to be considered more thoroughly. The evaluation task is not well-understood in the context of combining distributed problem-solving knowledge and ontologies. Both parts-expressive knowledge bases and ontologies-have been investigated in the past, but little research is available for a combined approach. Recently, the verification of ontologies with rules was investigated in Baumeister &amp; Seipel <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, but no framework for the combination of general problem-solving knowledge with ontologies is known at the moment. Besides the verification of distributed knowledge, e.g., see Baumeister &amp; Nalepa <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, also the validation of the knowledge needs to be considered in more detail. In addition, the evaluation of the explicit parts of the knowledge base in combination with the informal parts (text, multimedia) is also an open issue, that has not been solved sufficiently. Besides formal evaluation methods, the integration of socially-inspired evaluation approaches is an interesting issue, for example the application and the analysis of (advanced) user ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, experiences show that the maintainability of a knowledge base is critical for the longterm success of a system. In consequence, the evolution of distributed knowledge is an important research issue for the future, especially its evolution at different levels of formality. The current state-of-the-art provides separate works for ontology evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>, and for the evolution of more expressive knowledge bases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Little work, however, has been done in the field of the combined evolution of knowledge at different levels of formality. Semantic Wikis provide the possibility to synchronously represent knowledge at different levels, for example in textual form and as a rule base. For the evolution of knowledge it appears natural, that also a combined approach for the modification of all existing knowledge elements can be provided.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig.3Task ontology: Integrating problem-solving knowledge into a Semantic Wiki.
