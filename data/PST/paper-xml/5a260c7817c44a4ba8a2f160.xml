<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Although image watermarking schemes based on singular value decomposition (SVD) demonstrate high robustness and imperceptibility, they are exposed to the false positive problem (FPP). This drawback mostly occurs when embedding steps depend on singular values while singular vectors are used as secret keys. In this study, a new reliable SVD-based image watermarking scheme that uses integer wavelet transform (IWT) is proposed to overcome FPP and fulfill all watermarking requirements. Unlike in other schemes, the S and V matrices of the watermark are used as secret keys, whereas the S singular vector of the watermark is embedded into the singular values of the host image. The additional secret key is obtained from the watermarked image during the embedding process to increase security and avoid FPP completely. To improve the robustness, as well as achieve balance between robustness and imperceptibility, multi-objective ant colony optimization (MOACO) is utilized to find the optimal scaling factors, namely, multiple zooming factors. Results of the robustness, imperceptibility, and reliability tests demonstrate that the proposed IWT-SVD-MOACO scheme outperforms several previous schemes and avoids FPP completely.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Diverse computer and communication technologies have resulted in new opportunities to process and distribute multimedia information. These technologies include powerful software and devices (e.g., scanners, printers, and digital cameras) that enable users to create, manipulate, duplicate, and distribute images easily and economically. Moreover, the development of multimedia networks and the availability of numerous content distribution applications on the Internet (e.g., peer-to-peer file sharing and file transfer protocol) significantly contribute to facilitating the exchange and distribution of multimedia content, even among unauthorised users <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Protecting the intellectual property rights (IPR) of content, verifying the origin of content, and identifying authorised parties who initially distribute images to unauthorised parties are gaining attention. Several techniques have been generated to address these issues. Watermarking technology is an approach to IPR protection.</p><p>Digital image watermarking protects content by embedding a signal; imperceptible information (i.e., copyright protection information) into the host image without a noticeable degradation in visual quality. Consequently, a watermarked image is developed and marked as public or sent to end users. Extracted or detected watermarks can be used for copyright protection and content authentication <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Researchers interested in digital image watermarking are facing challenges in creating new algorithms with suitable properties (requirements) to serve their intended applications. The essential requirements for any watermarking technique are robustness, imperceptibility, capacity, and security. The performance of a given watermarking scheme can be assessed based on these properties. Robustness is the capability of a scheme to maintain the validity of including a watermark even after being subjected to geometric or non-geometric attacks. Imperceptibility is the property to indicate that the watermarked data (image) should retain the quality of the original one as closely as possible. Capacity refers to the number of bits that can be embedded into an image. A trade-off always exists among robustness, capacity, and imperceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. For example, enhancing watermark robustness will reduce its imperceptibility because of the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>high watermark energy placed on a cover image <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Moreover, a high capacity will compromise imperceptibility because numerous modifications in the cover image are required to embed the watermark. The fourth essential property, namely, security, refers to the resistance of the scheme against hostile attacks. Invisible watermarks ensure that attackers cannot access secured data to remove or alter them.</p><p>The current challenge is to achieve trade-off among the requirements of robustness, imperceptibility, and capacity. Most Watermarking technologies prioritize robustness and imperceptibility, which are the major requirements that differentiate watermarking from other data protection technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. The watermarking techniques are classified into spatial domain and transform domain techniques according to the embedding domain. Spatial domain techniques are the simplest; however, they suffer from several drawbacks. They provide low embedding capacity and the watermark can be easily removed using image processing operations. By contrast, transform domain techniques provide higher embedding capacity, more robust, and can preserve the imperceptibility. They are gaining popularity and provide accurate aspects of the human visual system model because of multi-resolution analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, redundant DWT (RDWT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, integer wavelet transform(IWT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, redistributed invariant discrete wavelet Transform (RIDWT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and lifting wavelet transform (LWT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> are examples of wavelet transforms.</p><p>Most image watermarking schemes improve their performance by combining two or more transforms; such schemes are referred to as hybrid schemes. This idea concept is based on the assumption that combining two or more transforms can make up for the defects of an individual transform, thereby resulting in an effective scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. The incentive for developing hybrid schemes is to use the properties of the incorporated transforms and achieve the required goals of the intended application. The success of hybrid schemes in achieving the desired goals depends on the appropriate selection of the involved transforms. Several robust hybrids of digital-image watermarking schemes based on singular value decomposition (SVD) in the wavelet domain were developed a few years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. A matrix in SVD is decomposed into three matrices: U , S and V T . These matrices have the same size as the original matrix as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A = U SV T (1)</formula><p>where S represents the singular values, and U and V T are the left and right</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T singular vectors. Various embedding strategies of SVD-based watermarking schemes are based on the involved U , S, and V matrices. Most researchers prefer to embed the watermark into S. Although the robustness and stability of such SVD-based watermarking schemes are good when embedding is performed in S, these schemes face a high probability of encountering the false positive problem (FPP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Recently, avoiding FPP has become one of the active research topics in the area of watermarking. FPP in SVD-based watermarking schemes occurs because both the U and V matrices are adopted as secret keys. The suggested solution for these kind of schemes is to propose an embedding technique that consider only one of the singular vectors as the secret key. Furthermore, an optimization method is used to select multiple scaling factors (MSF) instead of a single scaling factor (SSF) to maintain the trade-off between robustness and imperceptibility. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have played a major role in the watermarking field to improve the performance of schemes by optimizing scaling factors. Several optimization algorithms have been adopted and used in SVD-based watermarking schemes to achieve acceptable imperceptibility and robustness against most common attacks. Ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE), artificial bee colony (ABC), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are examples of optimization algorithms for AI techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, a new optimized SVD-based image watermarking scheme in the IWT domain is proposed. We propose a new embedding strategy where the singular vector (U wa ) of the watermark is embedded into the singular values of the first level of the IWT host image (S LL ). The novelty of this proposed scheme is using the singular vector (V wa ) and singular values (S wa ) as secret keys. Moreover, an extra secret key from the watermarked image is also generated in order to use it during the extraction process to achieve more security and completely avoid the FPP. Multiple objective ACO (MOACO) algorithm is used to select the optimal multiple zooming factors(MZF) to preform the proposed embedding strategy and maintain high visual quality of the host image. This scheme is called as IWT-SVD-MOACO. The proposed scheme demonstrates high robustness against different types of attacks as well as good imperceptibility. This scheme can solve the security issue attributed to FPP, and thus, it can be used for copyright protection.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers an explanation of the FPP; its reasons, modes of attack, and suggested solutions are presented. Section 3 briefly describes the preliminaries used in the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>In Section 4, the proposed IWT-SVD-MOACO scheme is explained. The experimental setup and results (i.e., imperceptibility and robustness tests, FPP reliability test and comparative analysis) of IWT-SVD-MOACO are presented in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are provided in Section 6. The abbreviations that used in this paper are summarized in   Due to the mathematical properties of SVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, most SVD-based image watermarking schemes display high robustness against image processing attacks and geometrical attacks while preserving good imperceptibility. Recently, SVD is preferred to be implemented with other transforms because it requires extensive computations when applied on its own. SVD-based digital watermarking schemes embed a watermark by modifying either the singular values (S) or the singular vectors (U and V ). Each embedding method has advantages and disadvantages. Most researchers prefer to embed into S given the stability and properties of S. Despite the stability and robustness of SVD-based image watermarking schemes that embed the watermark by altering S, these schemes fail to resolve the issue of rightful ownership because they are vulnerable to FPP. In this problem, a counterfeit watermark is detected from a content which a different watermark <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Two embedding methods lead to such problem. The first type of embedding method that is vulnerable to FPP is identified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S + αW = U W Host S W Host V T W Host (2)</formula><p>where S is the singular value matrix of the host image; W is the watermark; and U W Host , S W Host , and V T W Host are the matrices obtained after</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>applying SVD to the result of the previous embedding operation. (S W Host ) represents the singular values of the watermarked image (i.e., the image in which the watermark has been embedded), whereas (U W Host , V T W Host ) are the singular vectors. Examples of schemes that adopts such embedding method are <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. The second method is identified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S W atermarked = S + αS watermark<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In this embedding strategy, the watermark is subjected to SVD, and then U watermark , S watermark , and V T watermark are obtained. S and, S watermark are the singular values of the host and the watermark, respectively. The embedding process is achieved by altering S by adding S watermark to it after multiplying it with a scaling factor (α). S W atermarked represents the watermarked data. Ganic and Eskicioglu <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and Rastegar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed schemes that followed the embedding method described in Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><p>The observed flaws of the aforementioned embedding methods that are addressed using Equations ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and( 3) result from using (U and V ) as side information or secret keys for the extraction process. The U and V matrices include major information on the structure of an image. Thus, FPP occurs because an attacker can claim rightful ownership by using these secret keys in different manners (attacks). Three potential attacks are applied to any watermarking scheme using Equation (3) or Equation (2) as the embedding method. These attacks have been discussed and addressed in Zhang and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, Rykaczewski <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and Xiao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. To explain how these attacks operate, they are tested on the embedding method indicated by Equation (2). Moreover, similar attacks may occur using the embedding method described in Equation (3). The attacks are as follows according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1. Attack 1</formula><p>This type of attack (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) is interpreted as an ambiguity on the part of the owner. Suppose the owner has O as the host image and two different watermarks W 1 and W 2 . The owner applies the watermark embedding method twice. In the first, W 1 is embedded into O, which yields O 1 W as the watermarked image and (U 1 and V 1 ) as the secret keys. In the second, W 2 is embedded into O, which yields O 2 W as the watermarked image and U 2 and V 2 as the secret keys. FPP occurs during the extraction process when the owner extracts a watermark W 2 * from the O 1 W using the incorrect secret keys (U 2 and V 2 ). W 2 * is visually similar to W 2 . This result is considered to be a corrupted</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T watermark because W 1 is the correct embedded watermark in O 1</formula><p>W . A similar problem may occur when a watermark W 1 * is extracted from O 2 W using the incorrect secret keys (U 1 and V 1 . Thus, the owner extracts the corrupted watermark indicated as W 1 * , which appears similar to W 1 . However, the correct embedded watermark is W 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Attack 2</head><p>In this type of attack, two parties are considered, namely, the real owner and the attacker. The real owner embeds the watermark W into the host image O. O W is the obtained watermarked image and U W and V W are the secret keys used by the owner to prove ownership. When the owner publishes O W , an attacker can easily obtain it and then embed a forged watermark W F into O W using a similar embedding procedure. O W F is the watermarked image obtained by the attacker, and U W F and V W F are the secret keys that will be used by the attacker to claim rightful ownership. The attacker then succeeds in extracting the forged watermark with a high normalized correlation (N C) value from the watermarked image of the owner O W using U W F and V W F . Thus, to be declared as the rightful owner, both the real owner and the attacker can claim ownership of the same image O. This attack is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Attack 3</head><p>In this type of attack, the owner embeds the watermark image W into the host image O to obtain O W as the watermarked image. At the end of the watermark embedding process, U W and V W are obtained and can be used to extract the watermark at a later period, thereby proving ownership. FPP is detected in this type of attack when W X is successfully extracted from an arbitrary image X using U W and V W . W X is similar to the correct watermark W . Thus, the owner can claim ownership for X without embedding W into X. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, presents the diagram for this attack.</p><p>Several solutions have been proposed to address the security issue caused by FPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Loukhaoukha <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> adopted the embedding strategy denoted by Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) and suggested two solutions for FPP. In the first solution, a one-way hash function is applied to U watermark and V watermark to protect them. During the extraction process, a safety test is performed to verify the received U watermark and V watermark (which can be altered by an attacker) and compared with the hash values stored during the embedding</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Owner , O 𝑊 1 𝑊 2 Owner, O The Watermark Embedding Process 𝑈 1 𝑉 1 Owner, O W 1 Secret Keys 𝑈 2 𝑉 2 Owner, O W 2 Secret Keys 𝑈 2 𝑉 2 Owner, O W 1 Secret Keys 𝑈 1 𝑉 1 Owner, O W 2</formula></div>

If the values are matched, then they are authenticated and the extraction process is continued. Otherwise, the extraction is stopped. The second solution proposed in Loukhaoukha <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> involves encrypting the watermark before applying SVD on it and embedding S watermark into S. The obtained U watermark and, V watermark are for the encrypted watermark. There-   fore, the watermark should be decrypted during the extraction step to obtain the real watermark. If the received keys (U watermark and, V watermark ) are correct, then the watermark is correctly obtained. Otherwise, a random-like image is obtained. Similar to that in Loukhaoukha <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, Gupta and Raval</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a signature algorithm to check the received secret keys before doing the extraction process. Meanwhile in the Makbol and Khoo <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> scheme, the watermark itself is embedded into the S of the host. Equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is adopted to perform the embedding process. In addition, different signature algorithm is proposed for authentication of the secret keys to solve the security issue caused by FPP. All the aforementioned schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> have demonstrated high robustness against geometrical and non-geometrical attacks as well as good imperceptibility, particularly the Makbol and Khoo <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> scheme which outperforms the other schemes. The limitations of such these schemes that still have probability to FPP since the U watermark and, V watermark are used as secret keys. In addition to, the extra authentication process before the extraction is performed.</p><p>The second trend in solving FPP involves completely avoiding the occurrence of this problem. The adoption of matrices U and V as secret keys for the extraction process is source of the flaw. Hence, the idea to avoid adopting U and V as secret keys, and consequently, prevent FPP, has emerged. The first SVD-based image watermarking that adopted this idea was reported in Jain et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to solve the problem addressed by Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. A new pure SVD-based image watermarking method was proposed. In Jain et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> SVD was applied on the host image A, and the matrices U , S, and V were obtained. Similarly, SVD was applied on watermark W , and then U watermark , S watermark , and V T watermark were obtained. The same embedding method presented in Liu and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> was adopted; however, FPP was eliminated by minimally altering the Liu and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> proposed scheme. ((U watermark × S watermark )) was embedded instead of only S watermark , as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, into the S of the host. ((U watermark × S watermark )) is called the principal component. Jain et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> ensured that only the singular vector V watermark would be the secret key for the extraction process. Hence, even if it falls into the hands an attacker, he/she will not be able to utilize it to attack the image.</p><p>Although the problem caused by FPP identified by Equation (3) has been solved in Jain et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> by embedding the principal components of the watermark into the host, another significant problem will occur if only one scalar value of SSF is used in such reliable SVD-based watermarking scheme. A small SSF value achieves imperceptibility for the scheme but reduces its robustness to several common attacks; moreover, a high scaling factor improves robustness but negatively affects the imperceptibility. The problem is attributed to the lack of an algorithm that can select suitable scaling factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Factors are mostly selected through the trial-and-error method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Run et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> overcame such drawback by developing two SVD-based image watermarking schemes according to Jain et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. These schemes involve embedding the principal components of the watermark into the host image in the transform domain using a nearly optimum MSF. The MSF is implemented using an efficient optimization algorithm. Based on that, the researchers still looking for different embedding processes and adopt different optimization algorithms with low computation and high efficiency in order to implement their watermarking schemes.</p></div>

In many applications(e.g., image compression and processing), the input data contain integer samples. All classical transforms assume that the input data are floating point values even if they are actually integers. These floating point values represent the wavelet coefficients, which are then rounded to integer values. Hence, they lose their perfect reconstruction property. One of the significant features of lifting schemes is that they can be altered into a transform, that maps integers onto integers without rounding errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. This process is called IWT. IWT is reversible, and thus, it can ensure a perfect reconstruction property. It is more efficient and faster than LWT. Its properties can be utilized to enhance robustness and preserve imperceptibility. Similar to any lifting transform, the main procedure of IWT consists of three steps which are split, predict, and update as explained in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p></div>

An SVD of I can be identified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">I = U I S I V T I = r i=1 u i * s i * v T i<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">U I = [u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u R ] (5) A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T V I = [v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v R ]<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">S I =      s 1 s 2 . . . s R     <label>(7)</label></formula><p>U I and V I are orthogonal matrices of R × R , in which u i and v i , (1 &lt;= i &lt;= R), respectively, represent their column vectors. U I and V I , respectively known as the left and the right singular vectors. S I represents the singular values of I. It is a diagonal matrix of R × R. SVD is widely used in a variety of applications. This is due to the following properties:</p><p>1. The singular values (S I ) specify the luminance of the image, while the singular vectors (U I and V I ) represent the geometrical properties of the image. 2. A good stability of S I , indicates that the singular values of the image will not change fast, if a small perturbation is added to them. 3. Singular values are in descending order and many of them have smaller values than the first singular value. Updating or ignoring such small values during the reconstruction stage leads to a slight and non-noticeable effect on image quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">ACO Principle</head><p>The ACO algorithm was introduced by Dorigo <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> as a new metaheuristic to solve difficult optimisation problems.</p><p>ACO is inspired by the behaviour of ants species when they explore the area surrounding their nest to search for food <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. If they find food, then they evaluate the trail to and from the food source and they leave a chemical substance, called a pheromone trail, on the ground. Other ants can smell the pheromone and follow trails with a high pheromone concentration. They communicate and find the optimal path between the nes1t and the food source through the pheromone. So, they are able to transfer food effectively to their nest. The first point that should be considered is how the colony is represented within the ACO algorithm. For continuous variables, a colony of M ants is represented as a matrix A of M × N , where A = [X 1 , X 2 , ..., X M ] and X = [x 1 , x 2 , ..., x N ] t represent a vector of N variables that corresponds to a single ant. Considering how to model the pheromone communication</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>scheme is also important. For continuous model implementation, Socha and Dorigo <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> used a normal distribution, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">f pheromone = exp( -(x -x min ) 2 2σ 2 ) (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>x min represents the optimal point found in the design space, whereas the standard deviation σ is the index that indicates the aggregation of ants around the current minimum. x min and σ should be defined to initiate the ACO algorithm. The x min is randomly selected using a uniform distribution, whereas σ is chosen to be greater by at least by three times the length of the design space to uniformly locate the ants inside it. The values of each design variable for all the ants in the colony are updated at each iteration of the ACO algorithm. Finally, the distribution of pheromone over the design space is updated by the collecting the information gained throughout the optimisation steps. The pheromone is modeled using Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">8</ref>), and updating x min and σ as follows is necessary:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">σ = std(colony)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where std(colony) uses the colony of ants, i.e., the candidate solution, to retrieve a vector that contains the standard deviation for each design variable. Pheromone accumulation is increased within the vicinity of the candidate to achieve the ideal solution. However, to avoid premature convergence, negative updating procedures are not disregarded. Therefore, a simple method that consists of dissolving the pheromone is utilized. The principle of this method is to publish the amount of pheromone by modifying the current standard deviation (for each variable) according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">σ new = γ.σ old<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where the dissolving rate is (γ &gt; 1).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">MZF-MOACO</head><p>As explained in Section 1, the reliable hybrid SVD-based watermarking schemes are achieving a bad imperceptibility if one scalar value of the scaling factor is used.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Moreover, a high scalar value of SSF will improve robustness but negatively affect imperceptibility. This situation poses a major problem because no algorithm for selecting a suitable SSF is yet available, and many algorithms are based on the trial-and-error method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>In the proposed scheme in this study, the singular vector U wa of the watermark will be embedded into the S LL of the host image. In general, the values of U or V are too significantly smaller than the values of S, and thus zooming up or enlarging factors are used. Cox et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed that MSF or MZF would be preferred over SSF to achieve trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness. Cox et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> illustrated that SSF might be unsuitable for altering all the pixel values of the host image, and thus, MSF (MZF) would be used instead <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The term MZF is used to indicate that MZF includes values for zooming up, where Z is referred to as the zoom. A difficult problem lies in determining the optimal values of the MZF that achieves the highest imperceptibility and robustness, which is considered as an optimisation problem. As explained previously, different optimisation algorithms can be used to find and select the near optimum MSF or MZF. MZF is used instead of SSF to achieve the best possible robustness with high visual quality. The performances of these optimisation algorithms vary depending on the embedding and extraction watermarking algorithms. All of these optimisation algorithms exhibited good results, and the optimal scaling factors in their watermarking schemes have been obtained. Therefore, in our proposed scheme, Multi-Objective ACO (MOACO) is used to obtain the optimal MZF values. This algorithm is selected because of its low computational costs. On the basis of the preceding discussion, the embedding equation can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">E new = E +    α 1,1 α 1,2 • • • α 1,m . . . . . . . . . . . . α n,1 α n,2 • • • α n,m    * W (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where E is the principal component, n, and m are the image dimensions, and (α 1,1 , α 1,2 ,........α n,m ) are the MSF values that are used to control and satisfy the requirements of robustness and imperceptibility. The steps of applying the MOACO algorithm to the IWT-SVD-MOACO scheme to generate the optimal MZF are explained as follows:</p><p>1.

An initial population of ants similar to that in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">8</ref>) is randomly generated. This population will include a set of potential solutions. Each ant is named as X. The generation process is explained in Section 3.3. 4. For each individual X with length D in the population, the following are considered: i. The embedding process is applied using X as MZF as shown in Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. ii. The N C between the host (I) and the watermarked image (I W ) is Computed. iii. A set of selected attacks is applied on I W to produce T different attacked watermarked images { I W } for each original watermarked images {I W }. iv. The watermarking extraction process is applied to extract watermark W i from the attacked watermarked image I W . v. For each extracted watermark W i , the normalised correlation between the extracted watermark W i and the original watermark W is computed; that is, N C(W, W i ). vi. The vector of the objective values, F (X), is construct and defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">F (X) = ( 1 N C(I, I W p ) 1 N C(W, W ) 1 N C(W, W p1 ) 1 N C(W, W p2 ) ... 1 N C(W, W pT ) )<label>(12</label></formula><p>) vii.

The test is conducted by exposing the proposed scheme to three potential attacks that may lead to FPP. These attacks are called attack 1, attack 2, and attack 3, as illustrated in Section 2. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, and 3 represent the descriptions of these attacks. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7,</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref>, and 9 show the reliability results after applying attacks 1, 2, and 3 of FPP on the IWT-SVD-MOACO scheme. Thus, FPP is avoided completely in our proposed IWT-SVD-MOACO scheme. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a</ref> shows the watermarked Lena image when the cameraman watermark is embedded into it as watermarked image for owner 1. Meanwhile, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7c</ref> A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T shows the watermarked Lena image when the women watermark is embedded into it as watermarked image for owner 2. From the proposed scheme, the embedding procedure can be represented as follows. For owner 1, the secret keys are S wa(cameraman) , V wa(cameraman) , and S new LL(cameraman) . Owner 1 will find U wa(cameraman) , and then use it to extract the watermark that should be the cameraman watermark image. For owner 2, the secret keys are S wa(women) , V wa(women) , and S new LL(women) . Owner 2 will find U wa(women) , and then use it to extract the watermark that should be the women watermark image. On the basis of attack 1, owner 1 will use the secret keys of owner 2, and vice versa. Therefore, the final extraction equation at the side owner 1 (Equation <ref type="formula">25</ref>) will be as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>Extracted watermark owner 1 = U W (cameraman) * S wa(women) * V T wa(women) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> and that for the side of owner 2 will be as follows:</p><p>Extracted watermark owner 2 = U W (women) * S wa(cameraman) * V T wa(cameraman) (30) With U holding important information, the extracted watermarks of owners 1 and 2 are illustrated in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7b</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7d</ref>, respectively. Similar to attack 1, attack 2 can occur to the proposed scheme. In attack 2, the owner has its watermarked Lena image (cameraman inserted) as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">8c</ref> and its secret keys are S wa(cameraman) , V wa(cameraman) , and S new LL(cameraman) . The attacker follows the same embedding procedure on the other side and embeds a fake watermark image (women) into the Lena image to obtain the fake secret keys S wa(f ake) , V wa(f ake) , and S new LL(f ake) . These fake secret keys will be used in the final extraction equation (Equation <ref type="formula">25</ref>) as follows:</p><p>Extracted watermark attacker side = U W (cameraman) * S wa(f ake) * V T wa(f ake)</p><p>(31) The result of the fake extraction equation is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">8f</ref>. Finally, the proposed scheme may be exposed to attack 3. On the basis of the embedding procedure, the S wa(cameraman) , V wa(cameraman) , and S new LL(cameraman) secret keys are obtained when the cameraman watermark is embedded into the Lena  host image. When the attacker sends an arbitrary image (i.e., an unwatermarked Barbara image) to the receiver, the receiver can still extract the original watermark because he/she receive the same secret keys (S wa(cameraman) , V wa(cameraman) , and S LL(cameraman) of the real owner. However, this attack is avoided in this proposed scheme by developing S new LL(cameraman) , as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_39">SV D(LL * W (arbitrary) ) = U * W LL<label>(</label></formula><p>With U holding important information, the extracted watermark based on Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> is shown in 9b.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>A novel reliable SVD-based image watermarking scheme in the IWT domain that used MOACO was proposed in this study. In this scheme, a new embedding strategy was proposed in which the values of U wa of a greyscale watermark image were embedded into the singular values S LL of the LL subband of the host image. Hence, the idea to devise SVD-based schemes that avoid FPP by not adopting U and V as secret keys, which include major information of the image, emerged. The proposed scheme embedded U wa in the S LL of the host while S wa and V wa were used as secret keys, thus the FPP was avoided. In addition, the scheme is blind, which improves the security issue. Therefore, the proposed scheme is reliable and the security requirement has been satisfied. Furthermore, this scheme achieved trade-off between robustness and imperceptibility where multiple factors were obtained and used as scaling factors to achieve the highest possible robustness without losing imperceptibility. MOACO optimization algorithm was used within the proposed scheme to obtain the optimal values of MZF to achieve the imperceptibility target. The proposed scheme exhibited high resistance against geometrical and non-geometrical attacks, and provided high imperceptibility. The scheme succeeded in achieving imperceptibility, robustness, and security because of the blind issue and reliability. Thus, it can be used for different watermarking applications such as copyright protection and authentication.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Comparative analysis</head><p>Table <ref type="table">9</ref> summarizes the similarities, differences, and some highlighted points of the proposed IWT-SVD-MOACO scheme and several other schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. From the comparison table shows that the embedding sub band of the proposed scheme is LL 1 ( the first decomposition level), unlike the other schemes that embedded the watermark into LH 3 (the third decomposition level). All the schemes in the table satisfy the security issue caused by FPP. The schemes have eliminated FPP which has occurred as a result of exposing the watermark to the SVD addressed by Equation (3). ACO is the optimisation method used in the proposed scheme to obtain the optimal MZF. ACO is selected because of to its low computational requirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. ACO was also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, whereas Loukhaoukha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> used GA and Loukhaoukha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> used PSO. However, the embedded watermark of the proposed scheme is a 256 × 256 greyscale image (i.e., high capacity), the scheme exhibits high imperceptibility as compared to other schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> that embedded a binary watermark image with size of 32 × 32. Thus, the proposed scheme outperforms the other schemes in terms of imperceptibility, capacity, and security. Furthermore, high robustness results are also achieved by the proposed scheme in different image processing and geometrical attacks. In terms of time complexity, the wavelet transforms incur lesser time complexity due to nice features of space-frequency localization and multiresolutions, especially the IWT O(N) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The time complexity of the optimization algorithms depends on their iteration and their step. Overall, the ACO is considered as one of the low time complexity algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. </p></div>			</div>
