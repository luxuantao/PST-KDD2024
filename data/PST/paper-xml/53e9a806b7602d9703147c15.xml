<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N mobile communications, high speeds of terminals and/or scatterers cause Doppler effects that could seriously affect the performance. To understand this problem, we need accurate models of the Doppler-affected or time-varying (TV) channels, whose channel taps vary with time. A common approach is to describe the channel taps statistically by their Doppler spectrum, which typically is bathtub-shaped <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, bell-shaped <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, or a combination thereof. The statistics assumed in these channel models are usually based on physical propagation parameters such as the path delays, path phases, path frequencies, path angles of arrival, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Despite their accuracy, these statistical models are generally bulky and difficult to handle. Therefore, many existing works resort to a parsimonious channel model such as the basis expansion model (BEM).</p><p>The BEM that is optimal in terms of the mean square error (MSE) is the so-called discrete Karhuen-Lo√®ve BEM (DKL-BEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which is, in essence, a reduced-rank decomposition of a certain type of Doppler spectrum, e.g., the bathtub-shaped or bell-shaped spectrum. The problem though is that if the assumed channel statistics deviate from the true scenario, which is very likely in practice, the DKL-BEM will perform suboptimally. As a compromise, one can derive a BEM that is based on a general approximation for all kinds of channel statistics. For instance, the discrete prolate spheroidal BEM (DPS-BEM) corresponds to the DKL-BEM with a rectangular spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It is featured by a set of orthogonal spheroidal functions that are perfectly band-limited but have maximal time concentration within the considered interval. Note that it is also possible to construct BEMs that are not per se dependent on the channel statistics like the so-called complex-exponential BEM (CE-BEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Its basis functions are complex exponentials that have a period equal to the length of the considered interval. The CE-BEM gained a great deal of attention thanks to its algebraic ease [8]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, but induces a larger modeling error. As we understand, the CE-BEM can actually be viewed as a special DKL-BEM but based on a white spectrum. An improved modeling performance is obtained by the so-called generalized CE-BEM (GCE-BEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which employs a set of complex exponentials that are more closely spaced in the frequency domain than those related to the traditional CE-BEM. Finally, a great deal of attention goes to the polynomial BEM (P-BEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which models each tap as a linear combination of a set of polynomials. Its modeling performance is rather sensitive to the Doppler spread though it has a better fit for low Doppler spreads than for high Doppler spreads. Note that it is also possible to combine the aforementioned BEMs for different purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Apart from the BEM, another modeling approach is to use a Gauss-Markov process to simulate the channel dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Such a model is interesting for sequential time-domain processing. When we deal with block transmission/precoding schemes, such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), it is often more convenient to use a block-based channel model such as a BEM.</p><p>Focusing on the estimation of channels that are modeled by a BEM, we basically only need to estimate the BEM coefficients, which are usually smaller in number than the total number of channel unknowns. References <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> belong to the few works that focus on blind BEM channel estimation. References <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> propose pilot-assisted channel estimators based on different BEM assumptions, where commonly, pilots are clustered in the time domain such that the channel estimation can be realized without interference from neighboring data symbols. For frequency-domain communication systems such as OFDM, it is not clear what is the "optimum" strategy to place the pilots. This is due to the Doppler spread, which corrupts the orthogonality among the subcarriers and induces intercarrier interference (ICI). The receiver can find no subcarrier that solely depends on pilots and thus is not contaminated by data symbols. For this reason, many existing works view the frequency-domain channel matrix either as diagonal <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> thus ignoring the ICI completely, or strictly banded as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> that relies on a CE-BEM assumption. Apparently, these approaches suffer from a large estimation error for channels with a high Doppler spread, but admit a clustered pilot scheme in the frequency domain, which is adopted in many OFDM standards, e.g., terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. A different approach is to view the frequency-domain channel matrix as a full matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which reflects the true situation, but generally requires the pilots to occupy a whole OFDM symbol.</p><p>In this paper, we study the clustered pilot scheme in the frequency domain and at the same time view the frequency-domain channel matrix as approximately banded, which implies that we consider yet a full channel matrix but with most of its power concentrated around the main diagonal and degrading rapidly from the diagonal to the margin. This view complies with the observations made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and can be represented by most BEMs except for the CE-BEM, which results in a strictly banded frequency-domain channel matrix. However, the bandwidth of such an approximately banded channel matrix is hard to define and if we artificially select a clear-cut bandwidth, the out-of-band entries will give rise to interference. This paper will show that by taking this interference wisely into account in traditional estimator designs, such as the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator or the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), we can improve the estimation accuracy. This is in contrast to the least squares (LS) estimator, which requires the interference to be as small as possible. In other words, the amount of interference we take into account has a significant impact on each estimator. This effect will be analyzed in this paper and a criterion to select the optimal amount of interference for different types of channel estimators will be proposed.</p><p>Recently, an increased interest has emerged in low-complexity equalization of TV channels for OFDM systems, many of which rely on the strictly banded assumption of the channel matrix in the frequency domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Undoubtedly, for the data model introduced in this paper, the out-of-band interference can compromise the performance of such equalizers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposed receiver windowing to suppress this interference, but they have not considered how this will affect the channel estimation performance. In a nutshell, now that the channel is reshaped by the window, both the channel estimator and the BEM design must be adapted accordingly. To motivate the latter briefly, it is not hard to imagine that if the channel changes due to the windowing, the traditional BEM design needs to be adapted also to maintain a tight fit. Notably, the CE-BEM forms an exception and should remain unaltered irrespective of the existence of windowing.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents how a windowed TV channel can be approximated by a proper BEM and accordingly establishes the OFDM system model. Section III formulates the data model that we will apply to channel estimation. In Section IV, we propose three channel estimators and their optimization. Simulation results are exhibited in Section V, and we conclude the paper with Section VI.</p><p>Notation: We use upper (lower) bold face letters to denote matrices (column vectors).</p><p>, , and represent conjugate, transpose, and complex conjugate transpose (Hermitian), respectively.</p><p>stands for the expected value with respect to the random variable . and represent the Kronecker product and the Schur-Hadamard (elementwise) product, respectively. represents the pseudoinverse.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. OFDM System Model</head><p>Let us consider an OFDM system with subcarriers, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The th OFDM symbol is used to modulate carriers as , where stands for the point unitary discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix with . Making abstraction of the digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversions, is next concatenated by a cyclic prefix, sent over the channel, stripped from the cyclic prefix, and reshaped by a windowing filter. The resulting data stream can then be summarized as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where represents the time-domain window and and denote the channel matrix (noise) in the time domain without and with windowing, respectively. Let us now define and as the th channel tap at the th time instant without and with windowing, respectively, and let us assume that and have finite order , i.e., for or and for or . If we then assume that the length of the cyclic prefix satisfies , both and are "pseudocirculant" with and Note that by means of an appropriate window , a banded approximation of is more accurate than the corresponding banded approximation of . Therefore, low-complexity equalization schemes that exploit the banded assumption of the channel matrix in the frequency domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> will have an improved performance when appropriate windowing is employed. In the sequel, we will refer to the windowed channel as "the channel," unless otherwise stated.</p><p>The received samples are afterwards demodulated by the DFT matrix , resulting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> with denoting the channel matrix (noise) in the frequency domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Windowed BEM Channel Model</head><p>In this section, we will try to accurately model the time-domain channel by using a BEM. Collecting the TV behavior of the th channel tap within the th OFDM symbol in the vector , we can express as</p><p>where is an matrix that collects orthonormal basis functions as columns, represents the BEM coefficients for the th tap of the th OFDM symbol, and represents the corresponding BEM modeling error, which is assumed to be minimized in the MSE sense. Stacking all the channel taps within the th observation block in one vector we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where and . Denoted as , various traditional BEM designs have been reported to model the unwindowed TV channels, e.g., the CE-BEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; the GCE-BEM with <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>; the P-BEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>; and the DKL-BEM, which employs basis sequences that corresponds to the most significant eigenvectors of the autocorrelation matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> with <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where we assume that is identical for each channel tap up to a scaling. The DPS-BEM is constructed in a similar fashion, but based on a special that is associated with a rectangular Doppler spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The question arises as how to choose an appropriate BEM in case of windowing. Basically, we have the following two options:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i) ii).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">6</ref>), we add a square matrix to ensure that the columns of are orthonormal. Its usage is in general not mandatory but can simplify the analysis as will be clear later on. We observe in (6) that option i) ignores the window in the BEM design and sticks to the traditional "unwindowed" BEMs to model the windowed channels whereas option ii) includes the knowledge of the window in the BEM design. We will show in Section V that option ii) generally yields a tighter fit. This is because the window itself brings some additional time-variation on top of the unwindowed channel, which probably requires more basis functions for the traditional "unwindowed" BEM to maintain a tight fit. However, the time-variation due to the window is totally predictable and, hence, can be counteracted by simply absorbing it in our BEM design. The CE-BEM is an exception especially for channels with high Doppler spreads, in which case it is better to use option i). This is because the window is usually designed to make the frequency-domain channel matrix as banded as possible, and the CE-BEM yields itself a perfectly banded frequency-domain channel matrix. As a result, it is not necessary to include the window in the CE-BEM design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. OFDM System Model Based on BEM</head><p>From now on, we can describe the OFDM system model derived previously in light of the BEM. Since all the algorithms in this paper will be based on a single OFDM symbol, we drop the block index in the sequel. Substituting (4) in ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), we obtain after some algebra (7) where denotes the error vector induced by the BEM fitting error , is a circulant matrix whose first column is the frequency response of the th basis function <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> and is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal is the frequency response of the BEM coefficients corresponding to the th basis function <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Here, stands for the first columns of the matrix . Note that (7) subsumes the expression for time-invariant (TI) channels, in which case and becomes a scaled identity matrix. For TV channels, the nondiagonal entries of are in general not zero any more. This leads to a loss of orthogonality among the subcarriers known as ICI.</p><p>Before going on further, we will make the following assumption: a1) the BEM approximation holds perfectly, i.e., or . This assumption is motivated by the fact that we will mainly focus on BEMs that allow for a very good fit. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> For other BEMs that fail to capture the time-variation adequately, such as the CE-BEM for instance, we should actually take the modeling error into account. This topic is partly treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. However, even if we include this error term to derive the best estimator possible, we still do not have a reliable channel estimate simply because the BEM itself is not capable of fitting the true channel. This suggests that it makes not much sense to take the modeling error into account and explains why we apply a1) for all possible BEMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DATA MODEL FOR CHANNEL ESTIMATION</head><p>Instead of estimating the true bulky channel matrix , we will estimate the BEM coefficients in with the aid of pilots. We assume there are pilot clusters of length denoted as , , as indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. All these pilot clusters stacked together form the pilot vector . The pilot clusters are interleaved with information symbols, which can be collected in the information symbol vector . It is not clear what is the optimal pilot placement for TV OFDM systems. References <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> claim that equidistant pulse-shaped pilot clusters are optimal based on a CE-BEM channel assumption, while equidistant pilot clusters also find their practical advantage in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> though the channel follows the bathtub-shaped Doppler spectrum in that case. Despite its significance, we will not discuss this issue here but allow our re-ceiver design to be applicable for any frequency-multiplexed pilot placement scheme.</p><p>For a certain frequency-multiplexed pilot placement scheme, it is up to the receiver to decide which of the received samples must be used for channel estimation. This is crucial for a TV OFDM system since, due to the ICI (or in other words, the nondiagonal entries of ), the pilots' power is spread out over the whole frequency band. A judicious choice of the observation samples will enhance the channel estimation performance.</p><p>Generally speaking, is approximately banded suggesting that the ICI primarily comes from adjacent subcarriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. An extreme case occurs with the CE-BEM channel model, where the corresponding is an identity matrix but circularly shifted over columns, which implies that only the neighboring subcarriers give rise to interference.</p><p>To clarify the notations that will come forth, we plot the structure of in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, where the columns of are related to the positions of the pilots and data, which operate on through the diagonal matrix . The rows of are related to the observation samples. For the th pilot cluster , where stands for its begin position, let us consider the following vector consisting of observation samples:</p><p>It can be imagined that if were strictly banded with only nonzero diagonals, would be the vector of maximal length that exclusively depends on the pilot cluster . In this sense, could be interpreted as the assumed bandwidth of , as suggested in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. However, we must be cautious with this interpretation, because is not strictly banded for most BEMs. As a matter of fact, actually provides a handle on the amount of interference that we want to take into account. More importantly, is not confined to positive values as we will see later on, in which case the bandwidth physical interpretation cannot be directly accounted for.</p><p>To formulate the previous discussion in mathematical expressions with notations indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where is an matrix, representing the hatched parts of in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>; is an diagonal matrix, which is carved out of corresponding to the pilot-carrying subcarriers; is an matrix, representing the shaded parts of in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>; is an diagonal matrix, which is carved out of corresponding to the data-carrying subcarriers; finally, stands for the noise related to . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, we have thus uncoupled the effect of the data from the pilots, and put it in a separate term . This term, which poses a nuisance to channel estimation, is in general not zero since is not strictly banded. Let us rewrite <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> as a function of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> with and Here, collects the rows of corresponding to the positions of the pilots. Further, we want to underline that the interference term carries also channel information as can be seen from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> with and</p><p>. Here, collects the rows of corresponding to the positions of the information symbols.</p><p>Repeating the previous operations for all the observation vectors and introducing the notations , , and</p><p>, we obtain The afore described interference analysis is not restricted to any specific BEM. However, note that for the CE-BEM is strictly banded, and thus . Apparently, this leaves no vagueness about , which should then be set to . This case is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CHANNEL ESTIMATION AND OPTIMIZATION</head><p>In this section, we will discuss channel estimation based on the data model that has been established in the previous section. We make the following assumptions: a1) time-domain noise prior to windowing is assumed to be zero-mean white Gaussian with variance ; a2) data are assumed to be zero-mean white with variance and uncorrelated with the noise , i.e., . We will propose three channel estimators in this section: the LMMSE estimator relies on the statistics of , while the LS estimator and the BLUE treat as a deterministic variable. The performance of each channel estimator is sensitive to . This can be understood from ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, where the pilot-related is an matrix, and the interference-related is an matrix. Intuitively, one would reduce the interference term by setting as large as possible. The same idea is adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> though the authors address the problem from a different point of view. To explain this using the physical interpretation of , a larger corresponds to a more accurate band approximation of , and thus to a smaller interference. On the other hand, a larger , giving rise to a "fatter"</p><p>, is often detrimental if we are to deploy a linear channel estimator. We will examine the effect of individually for each estimator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. LMMSE Estimator</head><p>The LMMSE estimator treats as a stochastic variable. To be more specific, we introduce the following assumption: a4) channel vector is assumed to be uncorrelated with the noise and the information symbols , i.e., and . We seek a linear filter such that the MSE between the estimated BEM coefficients and the true BEM coefficients is minimal. In other words, we solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> It can be shown that <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> In deriving <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, we make use of assumptions a3) and a4), and introduce the following covariance matrix notations , , and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Relation between the pilots and the received samples.</p><p>, whose computation is given in Appendix A. Equation ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) leads to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> where . Note that although <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> bears a similar form to the classical LMMSE estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, it has the extra task to process the interference term , which contains the information of itself. For this purpose, the proposed LMMSE treats as stochastic and resorts to the assumed statistics of and . However, these statistics are difficult to retrieve in practice and not always reliable if, for instance, the Doppler spread is only roughly known or the assumed Doppler spectrum deviates from the true value. In such cases, the proposed LMMSE estimator is suboptimal. We will show some examples in Section V.</p><p>We want to use to reconstruct the BEM channel, and examine how close it is to the best BEM fit of the real channel. To this end, we adopt the MSE criterion as trace trace <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> The last equality holds since we have designed to have orthonormal columns [cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>]. Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> suggests that the channel fitting MSE equals the MSE of the estimated BEM coefficients. Therefore, the MSE resulting from the LMMSE channel estimator can be expressed as trace <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> Obviously, depends on . Later on, we will show how to find the optimal to minimize .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. LS Estimator</head><p>The LS estimator treats as a deterministic variable. It is straightforward to obtain such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> The LS estimator is the most robust estimator, requiring no knowledge about the channel and noise statistics. However, it performs inferior when the interference is prominent: we show in the simulation part that the LS estimator suffers from a large performance gap in comparison with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) (derived in Appendix B). In addition, the performance of the LS estimator relies heavily on the condition number of as we can see from the resulting MSE trace trace trace <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> which is again a function of .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Iterative BLUE</head><p>From ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), we can find an expression for the BLUE following similar steps as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr">Appendix 6B</ref>] by treating the interference and noise as a single disturbance term such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> where denotes the covariance matrix of the disturbance. Here, is again viewed as a deterministic variable and, therefore,</p><p>. Due to a3), we have with , whose derivation can be found in Appendix A.</p><p>However, ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) is not implementable since its computation entails the knowledge of itself. A recursive approach can be, therefore, applied: suppose at the th iteration, an estimate for is available denoted as . Next, we use this estimate to update the covariance matrix , which in turn is used to produce the BLUE for the next iteration and so on Note that a similar idea is adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> though applied in a different context.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Optimization of</head><p>In this section, we will optimize the number of observation samples used for channel estimation, or in other words seek the optimal that will minimize the estimator variance given in ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, and (25) for the LMMSE, LS, and BLUE, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> It is difficult to find a closed-form solution for <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, especially for the BLUE. An alternative is to evaluate (26) exhaustively, which is feasible since there is only a limited range for the possible values of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> as we recall that is the number of pilot clusters and is the size of each pilot cluster. Clearly, the lower bound of is due to the fact that the number of observation samples cannot exceed the number of subcarriers . The upper bound is associated with the rank condition of . To have a good performance in the absence of interference and noise, all considered channel estimators require to have full column rank. Despite its importance, it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss sufficient conditions for to have full column rank, which will depend on the choice of a specific BEM, the pilot pattern, and . Note that the full column-rank condition can be always checked offline. However, a necessary condition for to have a full column rank is that it should be tall or at least square, which posts a lower bound of .</p><p>Fortunately, even the exhaustive search might be avoided as will become evident from the simulations, where the MSE-versus-curves for each channel estimator often exhibit a monotonous trail, although not necessarily in the same direction. For the LS channel estimator, the curve is monotonously descending and thus the optimal must be chosen as large as possible. To explain this, we recall that a larger leads to a more accurate band assumption of the channel matrix and, hence, to a smaller out-of-band interference power as suggested in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4(a)</ref>. This is beneficial to the LS estimator, which is not good at suppressing the interference due to the lack of statistical knowledge. Opposed to the LS estimator, the LMMSE estimator and BLUE require the to be as small as possible. For practical setups, this often implies a negative , in which case the observation samples outnumber the pilots as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4(b)</ref>. We can see that some of the observation samples, e.g., in the two boundary areas, will suffer a very low signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) because for these observation samples the unknown data are magnified by the high-power diagonals of the channel matrix and, hence, are much more prominent than the pilots. However, this casts no serious problem to the LMMSE estimator and BLUE since both of them can take the interference into account in a positive way. We will come back to this issue in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we consider an OFDM system with subcarriers, where roughly 80% of the subcarriers are used for transmitting data symbols. The remaining subcarriers are reserved for pilots, which are grouped in equidistant clusters, each containing pilot tones. Inside each cluster, we adopt the scheme referred to as "frequency-domain Kronecker delta" (FDKD) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where a nonzero pilot is located in the middle of the cluster with zero guard bands on both sides.</p><p>The proposed channel estimators will be cast to TV channels, whose variation is described by the Doppler frequency normalized to the subcarrier spacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> where denotes the "virtual" velocity, the carrier frequency, the OFDM symbol duration, and the speed of light. Note that in case of a moving terminal, the "virtual" velocity equals the terminal velocity, whereas in case of a moving scatterer, the "virtual" velocity equals twice the scatterer velocity. To be able to approximate the TV channel by a CE-BEM, we use the standard rule of thumb to satisfy the Nyquist criterion. In the following test cases, we set such that could be adequate, but in order to reduce the impact of the BEM modeling error we select . For other BEMs, a different number of basis functions could lead to a better modeling performance. However, to make a comparison for a fixed estimation complexity, we will fix for all BEMs. In the following test cases, we will restrict ourselves to a moving terminal with many uniformly distributed scatterers in the close vicinity of the terminal, leading to the typical bathtubshaped Doppler spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We will follow the algorithms given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> to generate TV channels conform to such a Doppler spectrum. Further, we assume the channel to be a finite-impulse response (FIR) filter with taps, which are independent random variables with an exponential power intensity profile. More specifically, we take in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> with</p><p>. In short, we will characterize the TV channel with BEM coefficients. Test Case 1. The BEM Justification: We first list the modeling performance (e.g., the channel fitting performance in the absence of noise) of the DKL-BEM, CE-BEM, GCE-BEM, and P-BEM for a range of s. The DKL-BEM is constructed based on the bathtub-shaped Doppler spectrum but fixed at , and is thus suboptimal for other s. The BEM-modeled channel is compared to the true channel after windowing in terms of the modeling error . For the window design, we adopt the "MBAE-SOE" window presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which is a sum of three complex exponentials. We examine the modeling performance for two BEM designs: the first BEM design follows option i) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, which is the traditional BEM design ignoring the windowing; the second BEM design follows option ii) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and is adapted to the windowing. From the results that are sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, we can observe that by taking the windowing into account, the BEMs following option ii) yield in general a tighter fit with the windowed channel, with the only exception of the CE-BEM, which, by following option i), performs better within the tested Doppler frequency range. Further, it can seen that the DKL-BEM and P-BEM have the smallest modeling error at low Doppler frequencies but lose track if the channel varies faster. Apparently, for the DKL-BEM, the mismatch due to an underestimated Doppler frequency is much more harmful than the mismatch due to an overestimated Doppler frequency. The GCE-BEM that is virtually independent of the Doppler frequency is more robust in this sense.</p><p>For the following simulations, we will concentrate on TV channels at the following two Doppler frequencies: 1) and 2)</p><p>. For the LMMSE estimator, we will use the DKL-BEM and allow for a mismatch by assuming , which means that the mismatch will be induced not only in the BEM, but also in the estimator design. For the LS estimator and the BLUE, we will just use the GCE-BEM since both the channel estimators and the BEM are independent of the channel statistics. In addition, we will also compare our results with the channel estimation method for the CE-BEM presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Note that this method resembles our proposed LMMSE estimator (without mismatch) but uses a data model that is only applicable to the CE-BEM, i.e., the channel matrix is viewed as strictly banded.</p><p>Test Case 2. Seeking the Optimal : First, we need to find an optimal for the different channel estimators. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, is bounded by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> For these values, we evaluate the MSE of the LMMSE estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 10, 20, 30, and 40 dB, and depict the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. We observe that at low SNR, the effect of is not pronounced, whereas at high SNR, a smaller corresponds to a smaller MSE. This is especially true for , where the ICI is still severe in spite of windowing. Tuning is of greater importance in that case. Therefore, we choose as the optimal value, which implies that the whole OFDM symbol will be invoked for channel estimation.</p><p>The results for the LS estimator are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, where we observe that must be chosen as large as possible, i.e., . For the BLUE in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, a smaller always yields a lower MSE just like the LMMSE estimator and we should also take . However, complexity plays a crucial role in this case, because the BLUE has to be computed recursively and the procedure must be repeated for every OFDM symbol (note that the LMMSE estimator is in essence time-invariant and can thus be precomputed and stored offline). In practice, a smaller often requires more iterations to reach convergence, and during each iteration, it inflicts a larger computational effort because more observation samples have to be processed. Observing that  the MSE curve descends only slowly for , we select as a good compromise between complexity and performance for the BLUE.</p><p>Test Case 3. The Estimator Performance: Having determined for the LMMSE estimator, for the LS estimator, and for the BLUE, we inspect their channel estimation performance for a wide range of SNRs. Next to the MSE defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, which we will refer to as the "BEM MSE," we will also look at the so-called "channel MSE" which we define by - <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> Note that the channel MSE differs from the BEM MSE in that it explicitly takes the BEM modeling error into account, whereas the BEM MSE merely indicates how close the estimated channel is to the best possible BEM fit. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> depicts the performance  in terms of the BEM MSE, whereas Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> depicts the performance in terms of the channel MSE. We observe that these two performances are in general very close to each other, which suggests that assumption a1) brings no harm to channel estimation. Further, we remark that the LMMSE estimator, which is suboptimal due to the Doppler frequency mismatch, performs much better under TV channels with than with . This suggests that underestimating the Doppler frequency is more harmful than overestimating it.</p><p>The BEM MSE is also compared with the CRB (see the derivation in Appendix B) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The CRB is based on and obtained using the Monte Carlo method, thereby exploring the channel statistics. We observe that the performance of the BLUE is very close to the CRB.</p><p>Test Case 4. Equalization Performance Based on the Estimated Channel: For this test case, we will transmit quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)-modulated data symbols, and the channel will be equalized by the banded LMMSE equalizer proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, although other banded equalizers can be employed as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In short, the equalizer can be described as <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> where is the banded approximation of the original channel matrix, with being an matrix whose main diagonal, subdiagonals, and super-diagonals are ones, and the remaining entries are zero. Thanks to the banded approximation and a simple banded decomposition of , the complexity of the banded LMMSE equalizer is . Not disclosed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, a regularization term is added to the expression of , which serves to prevent performance degradation at high SNR. This performance degradation is caused by the following: i) the band approximation error and ii) the fact that the "pseudocirculant" channel matrix itself is extremely ill-conditioned. To determine in practice, we can first apply (31) by setting , then observe from which SNR the BER curve begins to saturate, and finally choose based on that SNR.</p><p>To examine the influence of the channel estimation error on the equalization, we construct the banded LMMSE equalizer utilizing the estimated channel obtained from our LMMSE estimator, LS estimator, and BLUE, respectively. We choose in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. As a comparison, we also list the equalization performances, which are based on the estimated CE-BEM channel and the perfect CSI. It can be seen that due to the Doppler diversity the equalizer renders a better performance for faster TV channels, but it is plagued by a higher BER floor. Comparing the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> with those in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>, we can conclude that the equalization performance is in consistence with the corresponding channel estimation performance for each Doppler frequency. Take the DKL-BEM and the CE-BEM at , for instance; the channel estimation for the CE-BEM is better at low SNR but worse at high SNR than that for the DKL-BEM. We can make a corresponding observation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>. which leads to the following Fisher information matrix (FIM):</p><p>(39) Adapting the results given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, we can formulate the real FIM as , we want to formulate as a function of . This is achieved by realizing that (41) with defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. Following the derivative rules given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, we have To work out the last equation, we realize that in the matrix , only the th until the th diagonal entries are associated with , with the coefficients . Therefore With the obtained FIM, we find a lower bound on the channel estimator's variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> trace trace <ref type="bibr">(45)</ref> which is also a lower bound on the MSE of the BEM channel, as can be seen from ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, the TV channel is modeled by the BEM, which takes possible windowing into account. We view the resulting channel to be approximately banded, and, hence, the interference comes primarily from the out-of-band part of the channel matrix, which is combated by an LMMSE estimator, an LS estimator, and an iterative BLUE. It is worth underlining that using these channel estimators, we recover the full frequency-domain channel matrix, instead of its banded approximation (unless we use a CE-BEM assumption).</p></div>
