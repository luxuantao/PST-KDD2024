<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing (JSDM) is a downlink multiuser MIMO scheme recently proposed by the authors in order to enable "massive MIMO" gains and simplified system operations for Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) systems. The key idea lies in partitioning the users into groups with approximately similar channel covariance eigenvectors and serving these groups by using two-stage downlink precoding scheme obtained as the concatenation of a pre-beamforming matrix, that depends only on the channel second-order statistics, with a multiuser MIMO linear precoding matrix, which is a function of the effective channels including pre-beamforming. The role of pre-beamforming is to reduce the dimensionality of the effective channel by exploiting the near-orthogonality of the eigenspaces of the channel covariances of the different user groups. This paper is an extension of our initial work on JSDM, and addresses some important practical issues. First, we focus on the regime of finite number of antennas and large number of users and show that JSDM with simple opportunistic user selection is able to achieve the same scaling law of the system capacity with full channel state information. Next, we consider the large-system regime (both antennas and users growing large) and propose a simple scheme for user grouping in a realistic setting where users have different angles of arrival and angular spreads. Finally, we propose a low-overhead probabilistic scheduling algorithm that selects the users at random with probabilities derived from large-system random matrix analysis. Since only the pre-selected users are required to feedback their channel state information, the proposed scheme realizes important savings in the CSIT feedback.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) is one of the core technologies expected to be adopted by the next generations of wireless communication systems. Its basic information theoretic principles are grounded in the well-developed theory of vector Gaussian broadcast channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, representative of a downlink scenario where a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas serves a number of wireless users. A considerable amount of effort has been dedicated to study the performance of such schemes in the presence of various practical constraints, including non-ideal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the overhead incurred by downlink channel probing and CSIT feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the extension to joint precoding over clusters of multiple BSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and the regime of very large number of antennas at the BS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In Frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems, where uplink and downlink transmissions occur in separate bands, CSIT is made available to the transmitter through explicit downlink training and uplink feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Analysis shows that for an appropriately designed feedback scheme, the channel estimation error due to feedback is negligible compared to the channel estimation error due to downlink training <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, the amount of downlink transmission resources (signal dimensions per time-frequency channel coherence slot) consumed by downlink training is proportional to the number of BS antennas, and the amount of CSIT feedback uplink transmission resources is proportional to the number of active users in the the system. Hence, in order to be able to exploit the advantages of a very large number of BS antennas, as done in time division duplexing "massive MIMO" systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, some channel dimensionality reduction technique must be employed.</p><p>Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing (JSDM) was proposed by the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to enable massive MIMO gains also for FDD systems. Exploiting the fact that the channel between a user and BS is spatially correlated, the key idea of JSDM lies in partitioning the users into groups with similar channel covariance eigenspaces and split the downlink beamforming into two linear stages: a pre-beamforming stage that depends only on the channel covariances, and a MU-MIMO precoding stage for the effective channel formed by pre-beamforming. The pre-beamforming matrix is chosen in order to minimize the interference across different groups, and the MU-MIMO precoding matrix takes care of the multiuser interference within each group. JSDM is suited for FDD systems since the prebeamforming matrix can be learned from the slowly-varying spatial correlation of the channel vectors (which may change at the time scale of 1-10 seconds) and the training dimension necessary to learn the effective channels is significantly less than the number of BS antennas, thanks to the dimensionality reduction of the pre-beamforming projection. Furthermore, JSDM lends itself to a hybrid digital analog implementation, where the MU-MIMO precoding stage is implemented in the baseband and the pre-beamforming stage is implemented in the analog RF domain. Hence, JSDM is particularly suited to systems operating at mm-wave bands (e.g., 6 to 300 GHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), where the number of antennas may be very large, but the number of RF chains (D/A conversion and modulation chains) is yet limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we showed that under some conditions of the channel covariance eigenvectors, JSDM is optimal and achieves the information theoretic capacity region of the corresponding vector Gaussian broadcast channel. In the case when the BS is equipped with a uniform linear antenna array and the number of antennas M is very large, the design of the pre-beamforming reduces to choosing certain columns of the M × M Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix whose indices depend on the angles of arrival (AoA) and angular spread (AS) of the user channels. As long as the different user groups have non-overlapping AoA supports, JSDM achieves optimality as M → ∞. This scheme further simplifies the information necessary for optimal pre-beamforming, since it requires only a coarse knowledge of the angular support of each user group instead of the whole channel covariance matrix. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> assumed that users in a particular group have the same channel covariance eigenspace. Furthermore, no user selection was considered, i.e., a certain number of users in each group was selected and scheduled for transmission at random.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Contributions</head><p>In this work, we expand our investigation of the JSDM scheme by focusing on the following topics, relevant for practical implementation.</p><p>In Section III, we focus on the non-asymptotic regime of finite number of base station antennas M and large number of users in each group. For this regime, we consider the performance of the well-known opportunistic beamforming scheme that serves on each downlink beam the user achieving the maximum Signal to Interference plus Noise (SINR) on that beam, reminiscent of current Ev-Do and HSDPA "highdata rate" schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In the regime of large number of users and fixed number of antennas, the scaling law of the sum capacity with opportunistic user selection has been widely investigated for uncorrelated channels under random beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and zero-forcing beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Also the case of correlated channels with random beamforming was investigated under the assumption that all users have the same channel covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. We improve upon these earlier works since we consider different groups of users with different channel covariance matrices. In particular, we show that the optimal sum rate scaling law can be achieved by JSDM with opportunistic user selection for a particular choice of "approximate block diagonalization" pre-beamforming matrix. Under certain special conditions on the correlation matrices of different groups, the sum rate gain the uncorrelated channel counterpart can be as large as M log M .</p><p>Then, in Section IV, differently from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we consider the more realistic case of users randomly distributed in the cell region, such that each user is characterized by its own individual AoA and AS. In order to apply the JSDM approach it is necessary to cluster the users into groups. We consider two approaches for the user grouping problem. The first is an extension of the classical K-means algorithm to the Grassmanian manifold. The second consists of a simple quantization of the Grassmanian manifold according to the minimum chordal distance criterion, for a fixed quantizer determined by geometric considerations. We compare these two methods under the opportunistic user selection scheme of Section III, and notice that the simplest fixed quantization method using blocks of columns of a DFT matrix as quantizer center points performs best.</p><p>Finally, motivated by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, in Section V we focus on the regime where the number of users is proportional to the number of antennas. In this regime, the DFT-based fixed quantization user grouping scheme reduces to a simple quantization in the 2-dimensional AoA-AS plane, under the assumption that the BS has a uniform linear antenna array. Since in this large-system regime, user selection becomes ineffective due to channel hardening <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we propose a probabilistic scheduling algorithm where users within each group are preselected at random, based on probabilities derived from the large-system asymptotic analysis, such that only the selected users are required to feedback their CSIT. With the proposed scheme, CSIT feedback is reduced since only the pre-selected (scheduled) users need to feedback their effective channels. We show the effectiveness of the proposed simplified downlink scheduling scheme by comparing with the case of where all users feedback their CSIT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Related literature</head><p>The idea of two-stage "hybrid" beamforming has been considered by various authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and it motivated by the fact that, while implementing a large number of antennas in a reasonable form factor may be feasible, having a correspondingly large number of RF chains may be too expensive or power consuming. Various methods for two-stage hybrid beamforming optimization have been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, (and references therein). To the best of our knowledge, our previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) was the first to provide a comprehensive performance analysis through the use of asymptotic random matrix theory and, driven by such analysis, a systematic approach to system optimization in the multiuser downlink case. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the pre-beamforming idea has been used to cope with inter-cell interference in a multi-cell scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. JSDM: A PRIMER</head><p>Consider the downlink of a cellular system formed by a BS having M antennas and serving K single antenna user terminals. We assume that the M × K dimensional channel matrix H H H = [h h h 1 , . . . , h h h K ] is fixed for a certain block length of T channel uses in the time-frequency plane, referred to as the channel coherence block length, and changes from block to block according to an ergodic stationary spatially white joint Gaussian process. A single channel use of such a system is denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y y y = H H H H x x x + z z z<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where y y y denotes the collection of received symbols for all the K users, h h h k is the M × 1 dimensional channel realization between the BS and user k, x x x = V V V d d d is the transmitted signal vector satisfying a power constraint P such that E[||x x x|| 2 ] ≤ P , V V V = B B BP P P is the downlink beamforming matrix consisting of two parts: B B B is the pre-beamforming matrix of dimensions M × b and P P P is the MU-MIMO precoding matrix of dimensions b × S, which is a function of the reduced dimensional effective channel H H H = B B B H H H H. In (1), d d d denotes the S ×1 vector of transmitted user data symbols (referred to as "streams").</p><p>In general, we have S ≤ min{b, K}, and this represents the number of simultaneously served users per channel use. As usual, z z z ∼ CN (0 0 0, I I I K ) denotes additive spatially and temporally white Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance.</p></div>

We let R R R k = U U U k Λ k U U U H</formula><p>k , where U U U k is the M × r k matrix of the eigenvectors corresponding to the r k non-zero eigenvalues of R R R k , given as the diagonal elements of the diagonal r k × r k matrix Λ k .

When the tall unitary condition holds, the optimal pre-beamforming consists of letting B B B = U U U (eigen-beamforming). In this case, the inter-group interference term disappears and the MU-MIMO channel (5) splits into the set of orthogonal MU-MIMO channels y y y g = H H H</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">H g P P P g d d d g + z z z g for g = 1, . . . , G, with H H H H g = W W W H g Λ 1/2</formula><p>g , where W W W g is r g × K g with i.i.d. elements ∼ CN (0, 1). Under the tall unitary condition, JSDM with eigen-beamforming achieves the same sum capacity of the MU-MIMO downlink with full CSIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">Th. 1]</ref>.</p><p>In practice, the tall unitary condition is not satisfied in general for finite M . Hence, a suitable design goal for the prebeamfroming matrices is to make the inter-group interference close to zero, i.e., U U U H g B B B g ≈ 0 0 0 ∀ g = g. Such design is referred to as approximate block-diagonalization (BD). If the group ranks r g are sufficiently small, the zero inter-group interference condition can be achieved exactly (in this case, we shall refer to exact BD).</p><p>Remark 1. For finite M and K, design methods for exact or approximate BD are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For approximate BD, in the event that exact BD is infeasible, the notion of effective rank as the number of r * g &lt; r g dominant eigenvalues of the channel covariance R R R g is introduced. This is a design parameter that can be optimized subject to the condition g r * g ≤ M . Furthermore, in the special case of uniform linear arrays, the channel covariances are Toeplitz. Owing to Szego's asymptotic theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> we show that the eigenvectors U U U g of R R R g are well approximated by the columns of an M ×M unitary DFT matrix whose indices corresponds to the support of the Fourier transform of the channel correlation function. We also show that two groups with disjoint AoA support have disjoint supports of their correlation Fourier transform, such that in the limit of M → ∞ the tall unitary condition of Definition 1 is always satisfied when the groups are chosen with disjoint AoA support. Also, in this case the (optimal) eigen-beamforming matrices U U U g reduce to simple "DFT beamforming", that can be implemented in the Rf analog domain by simple phase shifts and therefore are suited to hybrid beamforming implementations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SUM CAPACITY SCALING IN THE LARGE USER REGIME</head><p>In this section, we focus on the regime of finite M and large K, and obtain an asymptotic expression for the sum capacity when all the users within a group have the same channel covariance. The case G = 1 is treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Here, we consider the non-trivial extension to the case G &gt; 1. Without loss of fundamental generality, we assume that all groups contain the same number of users K g = K = K/G, for all g. We have: Theorem 1. The sum capacity of a MU-MIMO downlink system with M antennas at the BS, total transmit power constraint of P , and K users divided into G groups of equal size K = K/G, where users have mutually statistically independent channel vectors and users in group g have a common covariance matrix R R R g of rank r g , behaves, for K → ∞, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">R sum = β log log(K ) + β log P β + O(1),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where β = min{M, G g=1 r g } and where O(1) denotes a constant, independent of K .</p><p>Theorem 1 is proved by developing upper and lower bounds to the sum capacity. The upper bound analyzes directly the sum capacity of the underlying vector broadcast channel and is given in Appendix A. For the lower bound, we consider an explicit achievability strategy based on JSDM with a particular choice of the pre-beamforming matrix and opportunistic user selection in each group. This strategy generalizes the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (random beamforming and user selection) to the case where the users are clustered in groups, each of which has a different channel covariance matrix.</p><p>Remark 2. It is worthwhile to remark that since the prebeamforming matrices depend only on the channel secondorder statistics, the feedback required from each user is just the SINR achieved on each beam (or, equivalently, the maximum SINR and the index of the beam achieving this maximum <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). Hence, the achievability scheme has some practical interest since it is reminiscent of current technology based on opportunistic beamforming with Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>).</p><p>From the proof of the upper bound (see Appendix A), it is immediate to obtain the following side result: Corollary 1. The sum capacity of a MU-MIMO downlink system with M antennas, total transmit power constraint of P and K users per group with common covariance R R R g of rank r g , when the tall unitary condition in Definition 1 is satisfied, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R sum = G g=1 r g   log log K + log P G g=1 r g   + G g=1 log detΛ g + o(1),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where the o(1) term goes to zero when K → ∞.</p><p>It is also interesting to notice that, in certain conditions, the sum rate (39) can be significantly larger than the sum rate of the corresponding spatially isotropic case <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. For example, in the case where the channel covariance matrices are extremely directional (i.e., r g = 1) but all together form a tall unitary matrix with G = M groups in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> it is shown that the sum rate gain of the correlated versus the isotropic case is M log M + o(1). This regime can be approached in the case where users are seen from the BS under a very narrow AS, but their AoAs are sufficiently separated such that they can be resolved by the BS antenna array. Such result is somehow surprising since transmit antenna correlation has been traditionally regarded as detrimental, based on the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which considered the case of user channels with the same correlation (case G = 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Achievability</head><p>We consider a specific JSDM strategy with PGP (see ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">5</ref>)) by letting the number of downlink data streams per group be given by b g = S g = r * g , where r * g denotes the effective rank of R R R g , and the MU-MIMO precoding matrix in each group g be simply the identity matrix, i.e., P P P g = I I I r * g ∀ g. In order to allocate the downlink data streams to the users, we select r * g out of K users in each group g according to a max SINR criterion to be specified later. Notice that since the achieved SINR for each user and pre-beamforming beam is a function of the channel matrix realization, this scheme serves r * g out of K users "opportunistically", depending on the channel matrix realization. The pre-beamforming matrices B B B g are designed according to the approximate Block Diagonalization scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> mentioned before. For any pair of groups g, g , since the m-th column of B B B g , denoted by b b b g m , is in the null space of the first r * g eigenvectors of R R R g , we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">U U U H g b b b g m = 0 0 0 r * g ×1 x x x g,g ,m<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where x x x g,g ,m is some not necessarily zero vector of dimension r g -r * g . Notice that when exact block diagonalization is possible and we choose r * g = r g , then U U U H g b b b g m = 0 0 0 rg×1 .

In order to exploit effectively the JSDM approach, the users' population must be partitioned into groups according to the following qualitative principles: 1) users in the same group have channel covariance eigenspace spanning (approximately) a given common subspace, which characterizes the group; 2) the subspaces of groups served on the same time-frequency slot (transmission resource) by JSDM must be (approximately) mutually orthogonal, or at least have empty intersection. We specifically consider the case of a BS equipped with a uniform linear array. According to the single scattering ring model (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and references therein), the channel covariance matrix for a user located at AoA θ with AS ∆ has (m, p)-th elements</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">[R R R] m,p = 1 2∆ ∆+θ -∆+θ e -j2πD(m-p) sin(α) dα,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where λD denotes the minimum distance between the BS antenna elements. Here we assume each user k is characterized by the pair (θ k , ∆ k ) of its AoA and AS.

It is clear that the performance of JSDM resulting from fixed quantization depends critically on how we choose the group subspaces. We have considered two approaches.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Numerical results</head><p>We present some simulation results to show the performance of the different user grouping algorithms under the prebeamforming and opportunistic user selection JSDM scheme as in the achievability proof of Theorem 1 (see Section III-A). Having chosen the group eigenspaces {V V V * g } and the set of users S g for each group g, we obtain the pre-beamforming matrices {B B B g } by block diagonalization (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for details), such that (V V V * g ) H B B B g = 0 0 0 for all g = g . Notice that this does not mean that the system has no inter-group interference, since the actual user channels eigenspaces do not coincide exactly with the group subspaces. Within each group, users are allocated to the group beams according to the user selection algorithm used in the achievability of Theorem 1, denoted here as JSDM-GBF-ALL (group beamforming with CQI feedback from all beams). For the sake of comparison, we also considered two alternatives: 1) feeding back only the maximum SINR and the corresponding beam index, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (denoted by JSDM-GBF-MAX; 2) zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) for each group with semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS), as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> (denoted by JSDM-ZFBF-SUS). Notice that the latter requires feeding back the effective channel vectors {B B B H g h h h k : k ∈ S g }, and therefore incurs in a much larger feedback overhead.</p><p>We consider two examples with M = 8 and M = 16 BS antennas. We fix the total transmit power P = 10dB, allocate equal power per downlink data stream and normalize the noise variance to 1, such that SNR = P in the plots. We set G = 8. The angles of arrival for the users are generated randomly between -60 o to 60 o and the angular spreads are generated randomly between 5 o to 15 o . For the K-means clustering algorithm, the entire set of user covariances is clustered into G = 8 groups. For the fixed quantization algorithm, we choose θ ∈ {-57. same pattern are served on the same time-frequency slot, while users in different pattern are served in different slots. This partitioning into patterns is needed in order to keep the intergroup interference under control. For the K-means clustering algorithm, the partitioning of the group eigenspaces into two disjoint patterns is done such that the sum of the minimum distances of the two patterns is maximized. For the fixed quantization algorithm, the patterns are obtained by considering the geometry of angular separation. In particular, we have the two patterns:</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">{V V V * 1 , V V V * 3 , V V V * 5 , V V V * 7 } and {V V V * 2 , V V V * 4 , V V V * 6 , V V V * 8 }.</formula><p>Within each group, a specific user selection algorithm (JSDM-ZFBF-SUS, JSDM-GBF-MAX or JSDM-GBF-ALL) is applied for selecting the users which are served at any given timefrequency slot.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure">2(a</ref>) and 2(b) show the sum spectral efficiency (in bits/sec/Hz) versus the number of users in the system, averaged over the two patterns with different user selection algorithms for M = 8 and M = 16 respectively, when DFT-based user grouping is applied. For the sake of comparison, we show also the performance of ZFBF with random user selection (denoted by ZFBF-RANDOM-US), ZFBF with greedy user selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> (denoted by ZFBF-GUS) and ZFBF with semi-orthogonal user selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> (denoted by ZFBF-SUS), where instead of restricting to JSDM with per-group processing, the selection is performed across all users without grouping, on the basis of the full channel state information (i.e., without multiplication by the pre-beamforming matrices). These performances are shown here to compare how JSDM performs with respect to classical linear beamforming schemes without the structure constraint of fixed pre-beamforming. Notice that these user selection schemes require full channel state feedback from all users, and therefore are typically too costly in terms of feedback in order to be practical. However, it is interesting to note that JSDM outperforms ZFBF with a "simple-minded" random user selection.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>(a) shows the sum spectral efficiency versus the number of users for different user grouping algorithms with M = 16 and JSDM-ZFBF-SUS.

These results indicate that user grouping by DFT-based fixed quantization (indicated in the plots by "FQ") performs generally better than the other user grouping algorithms considered in this work. Hence, also because of its simplicity, this appears to be the preferred method for practical user grouping.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. LARGE SYSTEM LIMIT</head><p>In this section, we focus on the large system limit, i.e., when the number of antennas and the number of users go to infinity with a fixed ratio. Specifically, we modify the system model of Section II and introduce a scale parameter N , such that the BS has M N antennas and serves KN single antenna users. Then, we consider the system performance for N → ∞. In this limit, we shall see in Section V-A that the user grouping scheme with DFT-based fixed quantization takes on a very simple form, corresponding to a quantization of the AoA/AS plane. This requires only the knowledge of the AoAs and ASs of the users, instead of the whole covariance matrix. As far as user selection is concerned, we notice from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> that in the limit of N → ∞ user selection schemes (max SINR or SUS) become less and less effective because of "channel hardening", and require CQI feedback or effective channel state feedback from a large number of users, such that the benefit of "opportunistic" user selection is quickly offset by the extra cost of the feedback. Hence, following the idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we consider a probabilistic user selection scheme where users are selected with a certain probability distribution, which is optimized in order to maximize the system ergodic sum rate. In this way, only the users actually scheduled for transmission will have to feedback their channel state information, in line with the observations made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Probabilistic user selection</head><p>We assume that users are arranged into K co-located "user subgroups" with N users in each location. Notice that this assumption is made for analytical convenience, and corresponds to the quantization of the user spatial distribution into a number of discrete points in the coverage area. In this case, if the user locations correspond, on average, to an area A = total coverage area K (m 2 ), then N/A is the user average density (users/m 2 ). For a fixed coverage area, both the number of BS antennas and the user density grows to infinity, such that the total number of users per BS antenna is fixed and equal to K/M . Users in each subgroup k are statistically equivalent, with common covariance matrix R R R k (θ k , ∆ k ) that depends only on the location (AoA) and local scattering (AS). We define a group as a collection of subgroups, obtained by the application of the user grouping algorithm given in the previous section. The number of subgroups forming a group g is indicated by K g , such that K = g K g . Defining the M N × N channel matrix of a user subgroup g k , i.e., the k-th subgroup of the g-th group, as H H H g k , we have H H H g , the effective channel matrix of group g as</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">H H H g = [ H H H g1 . . .

The scheduling problem is formulated as the maximization of a strictly increasing and concave Network Utility Function G(•), representing some notion of fairness (for example, the class of α-fairness functions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which yield proportional fairness for α = 1, sum rate maximization for α = 0, and max-min fairness for α → ∞) over the set of achievable ergodic rates, or "throughputs". Since users within a subgroup are statistically equivalent, they all have the same throughput. Denoting the normalized <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> throughput of a subgroup k as Rk , i.e., the sum rate of the users in subgroup k divided by N , the scheduling problem reduces to solving the following optimization:</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">maximize G( R1 , . . . , RK ) subject to Rk ∈ R ∀ k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K}<label>(31)</label></formula><p>where R is the system throughput region. For the sake of simplicity, we consider only ZFBF MU-MIMO precoding with equal power allocated to each downlink data stream, such that R denotes the throughput region obtained using such scheme.</p><p>With zero forcing precoding, the BS can serve a maximum of min{K g N, b g N } users in a given time frequency slot in group g. In realistic scenarios of interest, K g &gt; b g for all groups g. This condition can be always verified assuming that the system has a sufficiently large number of users such that the number of co-located subgroups in each group is large enough. Therefore, the BS should select a subset of users not larger than G g=1 b g N to be served at each time slot. In order to find the optimal subset, an exhaustive search over all possible subsets of size less than or equal to G g=1 b g N over KN users is required. This search is combinatorial and it would be infeasible for a large number of users. Furthermore, it requires all users to feedback their effective channel vectors, which may be very costly when the number of users is much larger than the number of possible downlink streams. Hence, we propose a scheme where the BS selects γ k N users in each subgroup k at random, independently of the channel matrix realization, where γ k ∈ [0, 1] is referred to as the "fraction" of active users. Then, only the selected users feedback their effective channel and the BS serves them using JSDM-ZFBF (i.e., ZFBF in each group, irrespectively of the inter-group interference). Notice that, while γ k is a constant that depends only on the system statistics, the set of active users changes randomly at each slot and is uniformly distributed over all N γ k N active user subsets. This implies that all users in the same subgroup have equal chance of being served, achieving fairness across the users in the same subgroup.</p><p>Denoting by P u the per-stream downlink power (same for all streams) and noticing that the number of downlink streams per group is S g N = Kg k=1 γ k N , we have the constraints</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">S g = Kg k=1 γ g k ≤ b g ∀ g = 1, . . . , G<label>(32)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_64">N P u G g=1 S g ≤ P, (<label>33</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_65">)</formula><p>where P is the total power of the BS.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Results</head><p>We present some numerical results demonstrating the performance of the simplified user grouping algorithm based on quantization of the AoA-AS plane in conjunction with the proposed probabilistic user selection, for user fractions obtained by greedy optimization as seen before, for different network utility functions G(•). Specifically, we focus on two cases: 1) Proportional fairness scheduling (PFS), corresponding to the choice G( R1 , . . . , RK ) = k log Rk ; 2) Sum rate maximization, corresponding to the choice G( R1 , . . . , RK ) = k Rk . We assume a uniform distribution for the users' angle of arrival θ k ∈ (-60 o , 60 o ), and angular spread ∆ k ∈ (5 o , 15 o ), set the number of groups equal to 8 and divide these user groups into two overlapping patterns containing G = 4 groups each. Pattern 1 contains the groups 1,3,5 and 7, and pattern 2 contains the groups 2,4,6 and 8. For pattern 1, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">A g = g-1 2 G -1</formula><p>2 where g ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. For pattern 2, we have A g = g G -1 2 and g ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. We partition the user population based on their angles of arrival and angular spreads using the simplified user grouping algorithm described in Section V-A. After solving (off-line) for the optimal user fractions, we apply the probabilistic user selection scheme in order to schedule the users within each pattern. The two patterns are served in orthogonal time-frequency slots, with equal sharing of the transmission resource.</p><p>In a practical finite-dimensional system, for given user fractions {γ g k }, the users to be scheduled are selected randomly in the following manner: the BS can transmit a maximum of b g N independent data streams in each group g. At each slot, within each group g, the BS generates b g N i.i. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4(a</ref>) and 4(b) show the sum rate obtained for PFS and Sum rate Maximization, when simplified user grouping algorithm is applied and the optimal user fractions are obtained using the greedy heuristic based algorithm of Section V-B. The "sum rate" refers to the normalized sum rate averaged over the patterns. We fix M = 64 and compare the finite dimensional simulations (obtained for N = 1 and N = 2 and denoted by the "red" and "blue" curves) with the large system approximations (shown by the "black" curve). The finite dimensional simulations differ from those obtained using the large system results because of the intergroup interference, which does not vanish for finite N . With increasing N , the finite dimensional results will ultimately coincide with the large system limit. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5(a</ref> N increases, the distribution of the normalized rates for the subgroups approaches to that obtained from the large system analysis. We observe that, as expected, the group rates in the case of PFS are all positive, indicating that groups are served with some fairness. Instead, the group rate CDF for the case of sum rate maximization shows a "jump" at zero, indicating the fraction of groups that are given zero rate. In this case, the users in these groups are not served at all, and the system is unfair in favor of a higher total throughput. VI. CONCLUSION JSDM is a multiuser MIMO downlink scheme that aims to serve users by clustering them into groups such that users within a group have approximately similar channel covariances, while users across groups have near orthogonal covariances. JSDM was proposed and analyzed in the large system limit in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> under the assumption that the user channel covariance matrices are grouped into sets with the exact same eigenspace. In this paper, we have significantly extended these results in two ways. For the case of a finite number of BS antennas and large number of users, we obtained the scaling laws of the system sum capacity and showed that the sum capacity scales as log log K, where K is the number of users in the system, with a coefficient that depends on the sum of the ranks of the user group covariance matrices. Then, we investigated the general problem of clustering the users into groups (user grouping) when, realistically, each user has its own individual channel covariance matrix (i.e., no a priori groups with same covariance matrix are assumed). We proposed a simplified algorithm requiring only the knowledge of the users AoA and AS (i.e., the angular support of the scattering from which the BS transmit power is received at the user antenna). The proposed simplified grouping corresponds to the quantization of the AoA-AS plane and works well when the number of BS antennas is large. Finally, we considered the performance analysis in the large system limit (both large number of users and large number of BS antennas), obtained appealing closed-form fixed-point equations that enable to calculate the SINR for each user, and based on these expressions, we proposed a method to optimize the number of downlink streams to be served by JSDM for each (discretized) point in the AoA-AS plane. This can be optimized depending on a desired network utility function of the user rates, which can be chosen to implement a desired notion of fairness. Based on this optimization, we also proposed a probabilistic user selection that implicitly allocates the number of streams to the users according to the optimal downlink stream distribution. Finite dimensional simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="foot_1"><p>As a matter of fact, the channel covariance is slowly varying in time, depending on the user mobility. However, especially for nomadic users, the scattering environment characteristics and the AoA evolve in time much more slowly than the actual channel Rayleigh fading process, and can be considered "locally constant". Algorithms for covariance estimation and signal subspace tracking are well known and widely investigated. These could be used here to track the slow variations of the user channel covariance matrix. However, this subspace estimation and tracking aspect of the system is out of the scope of this work.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4" xml:id="foot_2"><p>Since the number of downlink streams scales linearly with N , the sum rate per subgroup also increases linearly in N . Then, in order to obtain meaningful limits and a meaningful network utility maximization problem, we divide the sum rate per subgroup by N .</p></note>
