<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years there has been increasing interest in the application of process algebras in the modelling and analysis of biological systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Process algebras have some interesting properties that make them particularly useful in this context. First of all, biological systems can be abstracted by concurrent systems: species may be seen as processes that can interact with each other and reactions may be modelled using actions. Secondly, process algebras give a formal representation of the system avoiding ambiguity. Thirdly, they offer compositionality, i.e. the possibility of defining the whole system starting from the definition of its subcomponents. Finally, different kinds of analyses can be performed on a process algebra model. These analyses provide conceptual tools which are complementary to established techniques: it is possible to detect and correct potential inaccuracies, to validate the model and to predict its possible behaviours.</p><p>The process algebra PEPA, originally defined for the performance analysis of computer systems, has been recently applied in the context of signalling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Two approaches have been proposed: one based on reagents (the so-called reagent-centric view) and another based on pathways (pathway-centric view). In both cases the species concentrations are discretised into levels, each level abstracting an interval of concentration values. In the reagent-centric view the PEPA sequential components represent various concentration levels of the species. The abstraction is ''processes as species''. This is different from the abstractions generally adopted in the application of other process algebras in systems biology, such as ''processes as molecules'' or ''processes as interactions''. The former is the most widely-used abstraction in this context and it has been chosen in a lot of case studies involving the π -calculus and Beta-binders <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. The latter has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for the modelling of biological systems by means of the stochastic Concurrent Constraint Programming (sCCP). In the pathway-centric approach of PEPA we have a more abstract view: the processes represent subpathways. Here multiple copies of components represent levels of concentration. The two views of PEPA have been shown to be equivalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Even though PEPA has proved useful in studying signalling pathways, it does not allow us to represent all the features of biological networks. The main difficulties are the definition of stoichiometric coefficients (i.e. the coefficients used to show the quantitative relationships of the reactants and products in a biochemical reaction) and the representation of kinetic laws. Indeed, stoichiometry is not represented explicitly and the reactions are assumed to be elementary. The problem of extending to the domain of kinetic laws beyond basic mass-action (hereafter called general kinetic laws) is particularly relevant, as these kinds of reactions are frequently found in the literature as abstractions of complex situations whose details are unknown. Reducing all reactions to the elementary steps is complex and often impractical. This problem impacts also on other process algebras <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Generally they rely on Gillespie's stochastic simulation which considers only elementary reactions. Some recent works have extended the approach of Gillespie to deal with complex reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> but these extensions are yet to be reflected in the work using process algebras. Previous work concerning the use of general kinetic laws in process algebras and formal methods was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. These are discussed in Section 10.</p><p>In this paper we present Bio-PEPA, a language for the modelling and the analysis of biochemical networks. A preliminary version of the language has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Here we describe the final version of the language, we introduce new definitions and more details about our approach.</p><p>A major feature of Bio-PEPA is the possibility to represent explicitly some features of biochemical models, such as stoichiometry and the role of the species in a given reaction. Furthermore functional rates are introduced to express general kinetic laws. Each action type represents a reaction and is associated with a functional rate. Bio-PEPA is equipped with an operational semantics and a stochastic labelled transition system based on discrete levels of concentration. In this respect our language follows a similar approach to the reagent-centric view of PEPA. The representation in terms of discrete levels of concentration is also reflected in the definition of the continuous time Markov chains (CTMC) derived from the system. Hereafter we call this Markov chain the CTMC with levels. We enrich Bio-PEPA with some notions of equivalence. We extend the definition of isomorphism and strong bisimulation proposed for PEPA in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to Bio-PEPA.</p><p>The idea underlying our work is represented schematically in the diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The context of application is biochemical networks. Broadly speaking, biochemical networks consist of some biochemical species, which interact with each other through reactions. The reaction dynamics are described in terms of kinetic laws. The biochemical networks can be obtained from databases such as KEGG <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> and BioModels Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. From the biological model, we develop the Bio-PEPA specification of the system. This is an intermediate, formal, compositional representation of the biological model. At this point we can apply different kinds of analyses, including stochastic simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, analysis based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), numerical solution of the CTMC and stochastic model checking using PRISM <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. The choice of one or more methods depends on the context of application <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>It is worth noting that the use of various kinds of analyses can help in understanding the system. We can use two or more analyses to investigate different but related aspects of the model. Furthermore, when they overlap, the results obtained can provide a further confirmation of the behaviour of the system. These aspects were considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> concerns the comparison of the results obtained using implicit numerical differentiation formulae to those obtained using approximate stochastic simulation in the case of a signalling pathway. This reveals a flaw in the use of the differentiation procedure producing misleading results. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> we presented an approach that uses stochastic simulation and the PRISM probabilistic model checker in tandem in order to investigate the properties of biological systems.</p><p>There exist some relations between the different kinds of analyses. It is well known that the ODE solution tends to the results of stochastic simulations when the number of elements is relatively high. Similarly, it is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> that the numerical solution of the CTMC with levels (derived from the PEPA pathway-centric view) tends to the solution of the ODEs when the number of levels increases. An analogous result has been recently proved for Bio-PEPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We showed that the set of ODEs derived from Bio-PEPA is able to capture the limiting behaviour of the CTMC with levels obtained from the same system. Furthermore we proposed an empirical methodology to find the granularity of the Bio-PEPA system for which the ODE model and the CTMC with levels are in a good agreement. The proposed definition is based on a notion of distance between the two models: the granularity of the system, expressed in terms of the step size of the concentration levels, is chosen in order to minimise this distance. In this way we are able to define an ODE model and a CTMC model that represent the same biological system and we use different analysis techniques from the two representations to investigate various properties of it.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 a description of biochemical networks is reported. Section 3 describes PEPA and reports the application of PEPA to the modelling of some signalling pathways. After that, in Section 4, we define Bio-PEPA.</p><p>The semantics of Bio-PEPA in terms of a labelled stochastic transition system is presented in Section 5. Section 6 reports some auxiliary definitions, used in the following Section 7, where some equivalences for Bio-PEPA are presented. In Section 8 we discuss the main kinds of analyses that can be used from a Bio-PEPA model. The translation of a biological model into Bio-PEPA and its subsequent analysis is described in Section 9. Section 10 reports some related works concerning the application of process algebras in systems biology. Finally, Section 11 reports some final observations and future investigations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Biochemical networks</head><p>We focus on biochemical networks, such as those collected in the Biomodels Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and KEGG <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. A biochemical system M is composed of:</p><p>(1) a set of compartments C. These represent the locations of the various species;</p><p>(2) a set of chemical species S. These species may be genes, proteins, etc. For each species an initial concentration is given;</p><p>(3) a set of (irreversible) reactions R. The general form of an irreversible reaction j is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">κ 1j A 1j + κ 2j A 2j + • • • + κ n j j A n j j E 1j ,E 2j ,...I 1j ,I 2j ,...;f j ----------→ κ 1j B 1j + κ 2j B 2j + • • • + κ m j j B m j j</formula><p>where A hj , h = 1, . . . , n j , are the reactants, B lj , l = 1, . . . , m j , are the products, E vj are the enzymes and I uj , the inhibitors. All these species belong to the set S. Enzymes and inhibitors are represented differently from the reactants and products. Their role is to enhance or inhibit the reaction, respectively. We call species that are involved in a reaction without changing their concentration (i.e. enzymes/activators and inhibitors) modifiers. The parameters κ hj and κ lj are the stoichiometry coefficients. These express the degree to which species participate in a reaction. The dynamics is described by a kinetic law f j . Reversible reactions can be regarded as a pair of forward and inverse reactions.</p><p>The best known kinetic law is mass-action: the rate of the reaction is proportional to the product of the reactants' concentrations. In published models it is common to find general kinetic laws, which describe approximations of sequences of reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. They are useful when it is difficult to derive certain information from the experiments, e.g. the reaction rates of elementary steps, or when there are different time-scales for the reactions. General kinetic laws are valid under some conditions, such as the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA). This describes the situation where one or more reaction steps may be considered faster than the others and so the quantity of intermediate elements can be considered to be constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PEPA and biological systems</head><p>PEPA was originally defined for the performance modelling of systems with concurrent behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Systems are represented as the composition of components which undertake actions. In PEPA each action is assumed to have a duration, which is represented by a random variable with a negative exponential distribution. PEPA has a set of combinators that allows the system description to be built up as the concurrent interaction of simple sequential components.</p><p>We informally introduce the syntax of the language below. For more details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prefix</head><p>The basic term is the prefix combinator (α, r).P. It denotes a component which has action type α and an exponentially distributed duration with parameter r (mean duration 1/r), and it subsequently behaves as P.</p><p>Choice The component P + Q represents a system which may behave either as P or as Q . The activities of both P and Q are enabled. The first activity to complete distinguishes one of them and the other is discarded.</p><p>Constant Constants are components whose meaning is given by a defining equation C def = P. They allow us to assign names to patterns of behaviour associated with components.</p><p>Hiding In P/H the set H identifies those activities which can be considered internal or private to the component P.</p><p>Cooperation The term P L Q denotes cooperation between P and Q over the cooperation set L, that determines those activities on which the cooperands are forced to synchronise. PEPA supports multiway synchronisation between components, i.e. synchronization can involve more than two components. For action types not in L, the components proceed independently and concurrently with their enabled activities. In the context of performance evaluation the rate for the synchronised activities is the minimum of the rates of the synchronising activities.</p><p>PEPA has a structured operational semantics which generates a labelled transition system and from this a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) is derived.</p><p>Recently, PEPA has been applied to the modelling and analysis of signalling pathways. A first study concerns the influence of the Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP) on the Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, whereas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> the PEPA system for Schoeberl's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> involving the MAP kinase and EFG receptors is reported. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> two modelling styles have been proposed, one based on the reagent-centric view and the other on the pathway-centric view. In the former each species is a distinct process and local states capture the variation in concentration levels: each level represents an interval of concentration values. The pathway-centric style provides a more abstract view and focuses on subpathways.</p><p>Here levels of concentration are represented by distinct instances of the processes. The two representations were shown to be equivalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In addition to the standard analysis offered by process algebras, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> a mapping from reagent-centric PEPA models to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), has been proposed.</p><p>From these works PEPA has been shown to be appropriate for the modelling of biological systems: it offers a high level of abstraction and focuses on compositionality and on the interactions. By using PEPA as a modelling language it is possible to apply different kinds of analyses, not only stochastic simulation, but also differential equations and study by means of model checking. However, not all the features of biochemical networks can be expressed using the present version of PEPA: the various kinetic laws are not considered and stoichiometry is added by hand in the conversion of PEPA into ODEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Bio-PEPA</head><p>The aim of this work is to define a new process algebra in order to model some of the features of biochemical networks that are not possible to represent in PEPA. We show that the new language is able to represent all the reactions in a straightforward way and it deals with stoichiometry and general kinetic laws.</p><p>We adopt a high level of abstraction similar to the one proposed in formalisms such as SBML <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Furthermore we have made the following assumptions:</p><p>(1) Compartments are static, i.e. compartments are not actively involved in the reactions -they are simply containers.</p><p>(2) Reactions are irreversible reactions.</p><p>The first assumption reflects the current information about locations that can be found in the literature and in the databases of biochemical networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The current information about compartments is poor and most models are based on some limitations. The assumption of static compartments for Bio-PEPA allows us to keep the language simple and at the same time to represent most of the features of the biochemical networks. For instance, the transport of a species from one compartment to another is modelled by introducing two distinct components representing the species. The translocation is abstracted by a transformation of one species into the other. Compartments must be considered in the definition of a Bio-PEPA system because in the analysis it can be necessary to have the size of the compartments (for instance for Gillespie's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>). More details about the modelling and analysis of compartments in Bio-PEPA is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The language is extended with some features in order to represent more details about locations of species and reactions. Also in this work compartments have a fixed structure, but their size can depend on time.</p><p>The second assumption is not restrictive as a reversible reaction can be split into two irreversible reactions, representing the forward and the inverse direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Discrete concentrations and granularity</head><p>The definition of the transition system for Bio-PEPA and the CTMC derived from it is based on the abstraction of discrete levels of concentration within a species: each component represents a species and it is parametric in terms of concentration levels. Some advantages of this view are:</p><p>• it deals with incomplete information in the exact number of elements;</p><p>• it leads to a reduction of the state space as there are less states for each component.</p><p>The abstraction in terms of levels of concentration was originally defined for PEPA in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and then used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In both the cases the authors focused on the case of reactions with mass-action kinetics and stoichiometry equal to one for all the reactants and products. Furthermore they considered the same step size H and the same maximum level N for all the species. In the following we adapt this approach to general kinetic laws, stoichiometry greater than one and different numbers of levels for the species. The granularity is defined in terms of the step size H of the concentration intervals. We define the same step size H for all the species. This is motivated by the fact that, following the law of conservation of mass, there must be a ''balance'' between the concentrations consumed (reactants) and the ones created (products). Given a species i, we can assume that it has a maximum finite concentration M i . This is to ensure a finite state space and therefore to make analysis conducted by numerical solution feasible. Each species can assume the discrete concentration levels from 0 (null concentration) to N i (maximum concentration). We have the following relations:</p><p>• The number of levels for the species i is given by N i + 1 where N i = M i /H (i.e. the integer value greater than or equal to M i /H).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• l i = x i /H</formula><p>, where l i is the concentration level and x i is the concentration for the species i. When initial values are considered we have l i,0 = x i,0 /H .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The syntax</head><p>The syntax is designed in order to collect the biological information needed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S ::= (α, κ) op S | S + S | C P ::= P L P | S(x) where op = ↓ | ↑ | ⊕ | | .</formula><p>The component S is called a sequential component (or species component) and represents a species. The component P, called a model component, describes the system and the interactions among components. The element C is the constant as in PEPA. We assume a countable set of model components C and a countable set of action types A. The element x is a positive real-valued parameter, usually interpreted as a concentration. We consider concentrations in the specification of the system as from them we can derive both the number of molecules and the number of levels in a straightforward way. Furthermore this information is generally given in the biochemical networks and from experiments.</p><p>The prefix term in PEPA is replaced by a new one, (α, κ) op S, containing information about the role of the species in the reaction associated with α:</p><p>• (α, κ) is the prefix, where α ∈ A is the action type and κ is the stoichiometry coefficient of the species in that reaction;</p><p>• the prefix combinator ''op'' represents the role of the species in the reaction. Specifically, ↓ indicates a reactant, ↑ a product, ⊕ an activator, an inhibitor and a generic modifier. The general modifier operator is useful to indicate species that are involved in a reaction without changing their concentration but which cannot be classified as activators or inhibitors.</p><p>For instance in transcription the gene remains constant but it cannot be seen as an enzyme.</p><p>The choice operator, cooperation and definition of constant are unchanged. As in PEPA, we have L ⊆ A. In contrast to PEPA the hiding operator is omitted, as it is not necessary for modelling biological systems. In order to fully describe a biochemical network in Bio-PEPA we need to define structures that collect information about the compartments, the species, the constant parameters and the functional rates. In the following the function name returns the names of the elements of a given Bio-PEPA component.</p><p>Definition 1. Each compartment is described by ''V: v unit'', where V is the compartment name, ''v'' is a positive real number expressing the compartment size and the (optional) ''unit'' denotes the unit associated with the compartment size. The set of compartments is denoted V.</p><p>The list of compartments is composed of at least one compartment. When no information about compartments is available we add a default compartment whose size is 1 and the unit of which depends on the model.</p><p>For each species represented in the system we can add some details that can then be used for the analysis. In the definition below the symbol ''_'' denotes the empty string.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2. For each species we define the element ''</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">C : H = value_H, N = value_N, M = value_M, V = value_V , unit = value_u'', where: • C is the species component name, • H is the step size and value_H ∈ R + ,</formula><p>• N is the maximum level and value_N ∈ N, • M is the maximum concentration and value_M ∈ R + ∪ {_}, • V is the name of the enclosing compartment and value_V ∈ name(V) ∪ {_}, • value_u represents the unit for concentration.</p><p>The set of all the elements described above is denoted N .</p><p>All the elements described above can be optional and their use depends on the kind of analysis we aim to perform. If only the compartment name is given, we can use the system for stochastic simulation and we can map it to ODEs, whereas if we are interested in the CTMC with levels or model checking with PRISM we also need the values for H and N (or, equivalently, H and M).</p><p>In order to collect the information about the dynamics of the system, we associate a functional rate f α j with each action type α j . This function represents the kinetic law of the associated reaction. For the definition of functional rates we consider mathematical expressions with simple operations and operators involving constant parameters and components. All the kinetic laws proposed in the book by Segel <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> can be defined in this way. In addition, for convenience, we include some predefined functions to express the most commonly used kinetic laws.</p><p>Definition 3. The functional rates are expressed by the following grammar:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f _rate ::= f α ( k, C) = sk | f α ( k) = sk2 sk ::= int | float | name | sk + sk | sk × sk | sk/sk | sk -sk | sk sk | exp(x) | log(sk) | sin(sk) | cos(sk) sk2 ::= f MA(sk) | fMM(sk, sk) | fH(sk, sk, int).</formula><p>The set of functional rates is denoted F R .</p><p>The mathematical expressions are defined by some mathematical operators (sk) and the predefined functions (sk2). The general expression for the functional rate contains the names of the parameters and the names of the species components involved in the associated reaction. The predefined kinetic laws considered here are mass-action (f MA), Michaelis-Menten (fMM) and Hill kinetics (fH). They depend only on some parameters; the components/species are derived from the context. The functional rates are defined externally to the components and are evaluated when the system is derived. They are used to derive the transition rates of the system. In the functional rates some parameter constants can be used. These must be defined in the model by means of the set of parameter definitions K. Definition 4. Each parameter is defined by ''k name = value unit'', where ''k name / ∈ C'' is the parameter name, ''value'' denotes a positive real number and the (optional) ''unit'' denotes the unit associated with the parameter. The set of the parameters is denoted K.</p><p>Finally, we have the following definition for the set of sequential components: Definition 5. The set Comp of sequential components is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Comp ::= {C def = S,</formula><p>where S is a sequential component }.</p><p>We can define the Bio-PEPA system in the following way: Definition 6. A Bio-PEPA system P is a 6-tuple V, N , K, F R , Comp, P , where:</p><p>• V is the set of compartments;</p><p>• N is the set of quantities describing each species;</p><p>• K is the set of parameter definitions;</p><p>• F R is the set of functional rate definitions;</p><p>• Comp is the set of definitions of sequential components;</p><p>• P is the model component describing the system.</p><p>In a well-defined Bio-PEPA system each element has to satisfy some conditions. The list N has to contain all the species components and, for each of them, at least its compartment must be defined. The optional elements of N must satisfy some simple conditions, for instance value_H &gt; 0 and value_H ∈ R + and value_N ∈ N with value_N ≥ 1. Concerning the functional rates, they are well-defined if each variable in their definition refers to the name of a species component in the list N or a constant parameter in the list K. For the definition of the species components, we have that each component C ∈ Comp must have subterms of the form ''(α, κ) op C '' and the action types in each single component must be all distinct. Finally, the model component P must be defined in terms of the species components defined in Comp and, for each cooperation set L j in P, L j ⊆ A(P). Moreover, the initial value for each species must be a non-negative real number less than or equal to the maximum value, when given. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for further details.</p><p>In the following we consider only well-defined Bio-PEPA systems. We denote by P the set of well-defined Bio-PEPA systems.</p><p>A Bio-PEPA system, with species components parametrised by concentration, is an implicitly continuous-state based representation. However an objective is to allow analysis of Bio-PEPA models by a variety of techniques, some of which are based on discrete-state representation. In particular we derive the CTMC with levels via a structured operational semantics and labelled transition system, after the continuous concentration parameter has been discretised into levels. We define a function levels over P , which, given a Bio-PEPA system P , derives the Bio-PEPA system P l , where the initial concentrations are replaced by the initial levels in the model component. This is possible only if the set N contains the step size for all the species. P l is called a ''Bio-PEPA system with levels''; it is well-defined if P is well-defined and if the levels for each species are less than or equal to the maximum ones. In the following we omit the subscript ''l'' when it is clear from the context.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Labelled transition systems with levels for Bio-PEPA</head><p>Bio-PEPA is given an operational semantics, similar to the one for PEPA. In this context we consider the abstraction for the species in terms of levels of concentration. For the rest of this section we consider Bio-PEPA systems with levels, i.e. the model component has discrete parameters, as described at the end of Section 4.2.</p><p>We define two relations over the processes. The former, called the capability relation, supports the derivation of quantitative information and it is auxiliary to the latter which is called the stochastic relation. The stochastic relation gives us the rates associated with each action type. The rates are obtained by evaluating the functional rate associated with the action, divided by the step size, and by using the quantitative information derived from the capability relation, as explained below. The use of two relations allows us to associate the rate with the last step of the derivation representing a given reaction, which makes it easier to derive the rate in the appropriate way, especially in the case of general kinetic laws different from mass-action.</p><p>The capability relation is -→ c ⊆ C × Θ × C, where C is the set of model components and the label θ ∈ Θ contains the quantitative information needed for the evaluation of the functional rate. We define the labels θ as θ := (α, w), where w is a list recording the species that participate in the reaction and is defined as [S : op(l, κ)] | w :: w, with S the name of the species component, l the level and κ the stoichiometry coefficient. The order of the components is not important. The relation -→ c is the minimum relation satisfying the rules reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We define a Labelled Transition System (LTS) for Bio-PEPA components as (C, Θ, -→ c ), with C, Θ and -→ c as described above.</p><p>The first three axioms in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> describe the behaviour of the three different prefix terms. In the case of a reactant, the level decreases, in the case of a product the level increases whereas in the case of a modifier the level remains the same.</p><p>Concerning the reactants and the products, the number of levels moved depends on the stoichiometric coefficient κ. This expresses the degree to which a species (reactant or product) participates in a reaction. Some side conditions concerning the present concentration level must be added to the rules. Specifically, for the reactants the level has to be greater than or equal to κ, whereas for the products the level has to be less than or equal to (Nκ), where N is the maximum level. For the modifiers, we have different side conditions according to the specific role of the species. When enzymes are considered, the level has to be greater than zero and less than or equal to the maximum level whereas, in the other cases, the level can be also equal to zero. Indeed if the enzyme is null the rate of the enzymatic reaction with Michaelis-Menten kinetics is zero and the reaction is not possible. This does not happen for reactions representing inhibition. The rules choice1 and choice2 have the usual meaning. The rule constant is used to define the behaviour of the constant term, defined by one or more prefix terms in summation. The label contains the information about the level and the stoichiometric coefficient related to the action type α. The last three rules report the case of cooperation. The rules coop1 and coop2 concern the case when the action type enabled does not belong to the cooperation set. In this case the label in the conclusion contains only the information about the component that fires the action. The rule coop3 describes the case in which the two components synchronise and the label reports the information from both the components.</p><p>In order to associate the rates with the transitions we introduce the stochastic relation -→ s ⊆ P × Γ × P , where the label γ ∈ Γ is defined as γ := (α, r α ), with r α ∈ R + . In this definition r α represents the parameter of a negative exponential distribution. The dynamic behaviour of processes is determined by a race condition: all activities enabled attempt to proceed but only the fastest succeeds. The relation -→ s is defined as the minimal relation satisfying the rule</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Final P (α j ,w) ---→ c P V, N , K, F , Comp, P (α j ,r α ) ---→ s V, N , K, F , Comp, P .</formula><p>The second element in the label of the conclusion represents the transition. The rate is calculated from the functional rate f α in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">r α = f α [w, N , K] H</formula><p>where H is the step size for the species involved in the reaction and the notation f α [w, N , K] means that the function f α is evaluated over w, N and K. In detail, for each component C i we derive the concentration as l i × H. Then we replace each free occurrence of C i with (l i × H) κ ij , where κ ij is the stoichiometric coefficient of the species i with respect to the reaction R j . Some observations about the derivation of the rate are reported in Section 5.1.</p><p>A Stochastic Labelled Transition System can be defined for a Bio-PEPA system.</p><p>Definition 7. The Stochastic Labelled Transition System (SLTS) for a Bio-PEPA system is ( P , Γ , -→ s ), where -→ s is the minimal relation satisfying the rule Final.</p><p>The states of the SLTS are defined in terms of the concentration levels of the system components and the transitions from one state to another represent reactions that cause changes in the concentration levels of some components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Derivation of rates</head><p>In the SLTS the states represent levels of concentration and the transitions cause a change in these levels for one or more species. The number of levels depends on the stoichiometric coefficients of the species involved.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> it was shown how to derive the transition rates in some specific cases. In the following we extend this approach to Bio-PEPA. The derivation is valid even when species have different numbers of levels and maximum concentrations.</p><p>Let us consider a reaction j described by a kinetic law f j and with all stoichiometric coefficients equal to one. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we can define the transition rate as ( t) -1 , where t is the time to have a variation in the concentration of one step for both the reactants and the products of the reaction. Let y be a variable describing one product of the reaction. We can consider the rate equation for that species with respect to the given reaction. This is dy/dt = f j (x), where x is the set (or a subset) of the reactants/modifiers of the reaction. We can apply the Taylor expansion up to the second term and we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">y n+1 ≈ y n + f (x n ) × (t n+1 -t n ).</formula><p>Now we can fix y n+1 -y n = H and then derive the time interval (t n+1 -t n ) = t as t ≈ H/f (x n ). From this we obtain the transition rate as f (x n )/H.</p><p>When the reaction has stoichiometric coefficients different from one, we can consider an approach similar to the one above. Let y be a product of the reaction. The approximation gives:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">y n+1 ≈ y n + κ × r × n r i=1 x κ i i,n × (t n+1 -t n )</formula><p>where r is the reaction constant rate, κ is stoichiometric coefficient of the product y, x i i = 1, . . . , n r are the reactants of the reaction, κ i i = 1, . . . , n r are the associated stoichiometric coefficients, n r is the number of distinct reactants and the kinetic law is assumed to be mass-action and so f (</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">x n ) = r × n r i=1 x κ i i,n .</formula><p>Now we can fix y n+1 -y n = κ × H and then derive the respective (t n+1 -t n ) = t as t ≈ H/(r × n r i=1 x κ i i,n ). From this expression we can derive the rate as usual. Some observations follow. First of all, this approach is based on an approximation; it depends on the time/concentration steps. Secondly, we assume that the species can vary by κ step sizes, where κ is the stoichiometric coefficient of the element with respect to the reaction considered. Reactants are assumed to decrease until 0 and products increase until a given value. This implies that the kinetic law, seen as a function of the reactants, must be positive. Mass-action, Hill-kinetics and Michaelis-Menten are all positive, as are many other kinetic laws.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Auxiliary definitions</head><p>In this section we report some auxiliary definitions. First of all we define the set of action types enabled in a species or model component. Definition 8. The set of current action types enabled in the model component P, denoted A(P), is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">A((α, κ) op S) = {α} A(S 1 + S 2 ) = A(S 1 ) ∪ A(S 2 ) A(C) = A(S) where C def = S A(S(l)) = A(S) A(P 1 L P 2 ) = A(P 1 )\L ∪ A(P 2 )\L ∪ (A(P 1 ) ∩ A(P 2 ) ∩ L).</formula><p>If P is a Bio-PEPA system with model component P, the set of current action types enabled in P is A(P ) = A(P).</p><p>The following definitions concern the derivative of a component, the derivative set and the derivative graph. We refer to the relation -→ s . The case of -→ c is analogous, the only differences are in the label and in the fact that the stochastic relation refers to Bio-PEPA systems and the capability relation refers to model components.</p></div>

If P</head><p>(α,r) --→ s P then P is a one-step -→ s system derivative of P .</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">If P (α 1 ,r 1 ) ---→ s P 1 (α 2 ,r 2 ) ---→ s • • • (α n ,r n )</formula><p>---→ s P then P is a system derivative of P .</p><p>We can indicate the sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">γ 1 -→ s γ 2 -→ s • • • γ n -→ s with µ -→ s ,</formula><p>where µ denotes the sequence γ 1 γ 2 , . . . , γ n (possibly empty).

The system derivative set ds(P ) is the smallest set such that:</p><p>• P ∈ ds(P );</p><p>• if P ∈ ds(P ) and there exists α ∈ A(P ) such that P (α,r) --→ s P then P ∈ ds(P ).</p><p>Definition 12. The system derivative graph D(P ) is the labelled directed graph whose set of nodes is ds(P ) and whose set of arcs are elements in ds(P ) × ds(P ) × Γ .</p><p>It is worth noting that in the case of well-defined Bio-PEPA components the multiplicity of P i , P j , γ is always one, which is why we do not need to consider a multigraph in the definition of the derivative graph as in PEPA . This is a consequence of the result reported in the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 1. Let P be a Bio-PEPA system. Let P u and P v be two derivatives of P such that the latter is one-step derivative of the former. If there exist two transitions P u</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">(α 1 ,r 1 ) ---→ s P v and P u (α 2 ,r 2 ) ---→ s P v then α 1 = α 2 .</formula><p>If two transitions are possible between a pair of states, the action types involved are different. In other words, for each α ∈ A we have at most one system α-derivative of a system P . This result follows from the assumption of distinct action types in each species component of well-defined Bio-PEPA systems.</p><p>The definitions above refer to Bio-PEPA systems with levels. The only element of the system P = V, N , K, F , Comp, P that evolves is the model component P. The other elements collect information about the compartments, the species, the rates and report the definition of the species components. They remain unchanged in the evolution of the system. In some cases it can be useful (and simpler) to focus on the model component instead of considering the whole system. We define a function π P (P ) = P, that, given a Bio-PEPA system returns the model component.</p><p>In the derivation of the CTMC (see Section 8.1) we need to identify the action types describing the transitions from one state to another. Definition 13. Let P be a Bio-PEPA system. Let P u , P v be two derivatives of the Bio-PEPA system P with P v a one-step derivative of P u .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A(P i )</head><p>The complete action type set of a component P is defined similarly.</p><p>Given the transition labels it can be useful to define some functions to extract information from them. For the label θ in the capability relation, the function action(θ ) = α extracts the former element of the pair (i.e. the action type) and list(θ ) = w returns the second element (i.e. the vector of quantitative information). Furthermore, the functions reacts(θ ), prods(θ ), mods(θ ), enzs(θ ), inhibs(θ ), totMods(θ ) return the sets of component names that are indicated as reactants, products, generic modifiers, enzymes, inhibitors and any of the last three possibilities from the label θ, respectively. The functions #reacts(θ ), #prods(θ ), #mods(θ ), #enzs(θ ), #inhibs(θ ), #totMods(θ ) return the number of elements involved as reactants, products and so on. For the label γ in the stochastic relation, the function action(γ ) = α extracts the first element of the pair (i.e. the action type) and the function rate(γ ) = r ∈ R returns the second element (i.e. the rate).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Equivalences</head><p>It is sometimes useful to consider equivalences between models in order to determine whether the systems represented are in some sense the ''same''. In this section we present some notions of equivalence for Bio-PEPA with levels in the model component. Some characteristics of the language impact on the definitions of equivalence and we start by highlighting those.</p><p>Firstly, there is no hiding operator or τ actions. Therefore, in Bio-PEPA we do not have weaker forms of equivalence based on abstracting τ actions. Secondly, in well-defined systems we have at most one action of a given type in each sequential term and each component describes the behaviour of a single species. So we cannot have processes of the form ''S + S'' or terms such as ''A = a.C '' (where A and C differ). Thirdly, if we have two transitions between the processes P and P , they involve different action types. Finally, we have defined two relations within the semantics. In one case the labels contain the information about the action type and about the elements involved. This is used as an auxiliary relation for the derivation of the second one, in which the labels contain the information about the action type and the rate (similarly to PEPA activity). Thus we have a choice of which relation to consider in the definition of equivalence. In the case of the capability relation, equivalences refer to model components, whereas in the case of stochastic relation they refer to Bio-PEPA systems.</p><p>In this section we present definitions of isomorphism and strong bisimulation which are similar to the relations defined for PEPA in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Furthermore, we show some properties of these defined equivalences and some relationships between them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Isomorphism</head><p>Isomorphism is a strong notion of equivalence based on the derivative graph of the components (systems).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">From Bio-PEPA to CTMC with levels</head><p>As for the reagent-centric view of PEPA, the CTMC associated with the system refers to the concentration levels of the species components. Specifically, the states of the CTMC are defined in terms of concentration levels and the transitions from one state to another describe some variations in these levels. In the following we refer to Bio-PEPA systems with levels.</p><p>The following two theorems concern the derivation of the CTMC associated with a Bio-PEPA system and the definition of the infinitesimal generator matrix. Theorem 1. For any finite Bio-PEPA system P = V, N , K, F R , Comp, P , if we define the stochastic process X(t) such that X (t) = P i indicates that the system behaves as P i ∈ ds(P ) at time t, then X(t) is a Markov Process.</p><p>The proof is not reproduced here but it is analogous to the one presented for PEPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Instead of the PEPA activity we consider the label γ of the stochastic relation and the rate is obtained by evaluating the functional rate in the system. Theorem 2. Let P be a Bio-PEPA system. Let n c = |ds(P )|, where ds(P ) is the derivative set of P . Then the infinitesimal generator matrix of the CTMC for P is an (n c × n c ) square matrix Q whose elements q u,v are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">q u,v = α j ∈A(P u |P v ) r α j if u = v q u,u = - u =v q u,v otherwise</formula><p>where P u , P v are two derivatives of P .</p><p>It is worth noting that the states of the CTMC can be defined in terms of the derivatives of the model component. These derivatives are uniquely identified by the levels of species components in the system, so we can give the following definition of the CTMC states: Definition 23. Each state of the CTMC derived from a Bio-PEPA system P can be defined as a vector σ = (l 1 , l 2 , . . . , l n ), where l i , for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, is the level of the species component i and n is the total number of species components in the model component P = π P (P ).</p><p>Some observations are reported below. Firstly, we consider finite models to ensure that a solution for the CTMC is feasible. This is equivalent to supposing that each species in the model has a maximum level of concentration.</p><p>Secondly, as mentioned earlier the CTMC with levels is an approximation of the continuous view of the system captured by ODEs. Its advantage is that the state space of the CTMC with levels can be considerably smaller than that generated by the molecular view of the system. This means that a variety of different analysis techniques such as passage time analysis and probabilistic model checking are accessible. The CTMC with levels can also be regarded as an approximation of the CTMC underlying the mapping to a stochastic simulation model based on molecules. In this case the levels represent aggregations of molecules.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">From Bio-PEPA to stochastic simulation</head><p>Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> is a widely-used method for the simulation of biochemical reactions. It deals with homogeneous, well-stirred systems in thermal equilibrium and constant volume, composed of n different species that interact through m reactions. Broadly speaking, the goal is to describe the evolution of the system X(t), in terms of the number of molecules of each species, starting from an initial state. Every reaction is characterised by a stochastic rate constant c j , termed the basal rate (derived from the constant rate r by means of the relations proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>). Using this it is possible to calculate the actual rate a j (X(t)) of the reaction, that is the probability of the reaction R j occurring in time (t, t + t) given that the system is in a specific state.</p><p>The translation of a Bio-PEPA model for Gillespie's stochastic simulation is similar to the approach proposed for ODEs.</p><p>The initial number of molecules for the species i can be calculated from the concentration as X i,0 = x i,0 × v × N A , where v is the volume of the compartment of the species and N A is the Avogadro number, i.e the number of molecules in a mole of a substance. For details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The main drawbacks are the definition of the rates and the correctness of the approach for general kinetic laws and reactions with more than two reactants. Indeed Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm supposes elementary reactions with at most two reactants and constant rates (mass-action kinetics). If the model contains only this kind of reaction the translation is straightforward. If there are non-elementary reactions and general kinetic laws, it is a widely-used approach to consider them translated directly into a stochastic context. This is not always valid and some counterexamples have been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> showed that when Gillespie's algorithm is applied to Hill kinetics in the context of the transcription initiation of autoregulated genes, the magnitude of fluctuations is overestimated. The application of Gillespie's algorithm in the case of general kinetics laws is discussed by several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Rao and Arkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> show that this approach is valid in the case of some specific kinetic laws, such as Michaelis-Menten and inhibition. However, it is important to remember that these laws are approximations and that specific conditions (such as ''S E'' in the case of Michaelis-Menten) hold. The derivation of Gillespie's rates for reactions with more than two reactants is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and these reactions are supported by various stochastic simulators (for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). Here we follow the approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>: we apply Gillespie's algorithm, but particular attention must be paid to the interpretation of the simulation results and to their validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.">From Bio-PEPA to PRISM</head><p>PRISM <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> is a probabilistic model checker, a tool for the formal modelling and analysis of systems which exhibit random or probabilistic behaviour. PRISM has been used to analyse systems from various application domains. Models are described using the PRISM language, a simple state-based language and it is possible to specify quantitative properties of the system using a temporal logic, called CSL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> (Continuous Stochastic Logic). For our purposes the underlying mathematical model of a PRISM model is a CTMC with levels. However we present the translation separately as the models are specified in the PRISM language.</p><p>The PRISM language is composed of modules and variables. A model is composed of a number of modules which can interact with each other. A module contains a number of local variables. The values of these variables at any given time constitute the state of the module. The global state of the whole model is determined by the local state of all modules. The behaviour of each module is described by a set of commands. Each update describes a transition which the module can make if the guard is true. A transition is specified by giving the new values of the variables in the module, possibly as a function of other variables. Each update is also assigned a probability (or in some cases a rate) which will be assigned to the corresponding transition.</p><p>We map Bio-PEPA systems to PRISM models where the variables express levels of concentration. Alternatively, it is possible to derive PRISM models where molecules are counted instead of levels. The two mappings are similar, the only differences are in the definition of the possible values for the species and the rates. Specifically, the values for the species are given in terms of levels or molecules and the rates must be chosen in order to take the interpretation into account. When levels are considered we use the rates defined in Section 5.1 whereas in the case of molecules the rates are the ones for Gillespie's simulation. The maximum concentration for each species must be given in the specification of Bio-PEPA system and, if necessary, the maximum number of molecules can be derived from it.</p><p>In the following we focus on the definition of the PRISM model in terms of concentration levels. We have the following correspondences:</p><p>• The model is defined as stochastic (this term is used in PRISM for CTMC).</p><p>• Each element in the set of parameters K is defined as a global constant.</p><p>• The concentration step, the maximum number of levels and the volume size for each species are defined as global constants.</p><p>• Each species component is represented by a PRISM module. The species component concentration is represented by a local variable and it can (generally) assume values between 0 and N i . For each subterm (i.e. each reaction in which the species is involved) we have a definition of a command. The name of the command is related to the action α (and then to the associated reaction). The guards and the change in levels are defined according to whether the element is a reactant, a product or a modifier of the reactions.</p><p>• The functional rates are defined inside an auxiliary module.</p><p>• In PRISM the rate associated with an action is the product of the rates of the commands in the different modules that cooperate. For each reaction, we give the value ''1'' to the rate of each command involved in the reaction, with the exception of the command in the module containing the functional rates. In this case the rate is the functional rate f , expressing the kinetic law. The rate associated with a reaction is given by 1 × 1 × • • • × f = f , as desired.</p></div>

First of all, from the Bio-PEPA system we can derive the SLTS and the CTMC. Remember that both consider levels of concentration. The transition system consists of 42 states and 108 transitions. The states are described by the levels of the single components. Specifically, we can define a state using a vector (M(l M ), P(l P ), P2(l P2 )), where l i , for i = M, P, P2, represents the level of each component. The parameter l i can assume the values 0 and 1 in the case of M, the values 0, 1, 2 for P and values between 0 and 6 for P2. The labels γ t of the stochastic transition system contain the action type α j and the rate r α j , calculated by applying the associated function f α j to the quantitative information collected in the labels of the  capability relation and dividing this by the step size of the reactants/products involved in the reaction. These rates are the ones associated with the CTMC transitions.</p><p>A second kind of analysis concerns differential equations.

The simulation results are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. We consider both deterministic and stochastic simulation. The two simulation graphs show the same behaviour (with the exception of some noise in Gillespie's simulation), as expected.</p><p>Finally, we consider the analysis by means of PRISM with levels. The full translation of the model into PRISM is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Each species is represented by a PRISM module and the reactions in which it is involved are captured by commands. In the following we report the definition of the modules representing the protein in the monomer and dimer form, respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">module p p : [0..Np] init 0; [a2] p &lt; Np → (p = p + 1); [a4] p &gt; 0 → (p = p -1); [a5] p &gt; 0 → (p = p -2); [a5i] p &lt; Np → (p = p + 2); endmodule module pd p2 : [0..Np2] init 0; [a5] p2 &lt; Np2 → (p2 = p2 + 1); [a5i] p2 &gt; 0 → (p2 = p2 -1); endmodule</formula><p>The variables p and p2 are local with respect to each of the two modules and represent the species ''protein in monomer form'' P and ''protein in dimer form'' P2, respectively. The possible values are [0..Np] for p and [0..Np2] for p2, while the initial values are 0. The monomer P is involved in four reactions while the dimer form P2 in just two. We have an additional module with the functional rates.</p><p>Properties of the system can be expressed formally in CSL and analysed against the constructed model. Two simple examples of possible queries are considered below. A first query considers the probability that the monomer is at level i at time T. The property is expressed by the form ''P =?[. . .]'', that returns a numerical value representing the probability of the proposition inside the square brackets. In our case the query is P</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">=?[true U[T , T ] p = i],</formula><p>where U is the bounded until operator and [T , T ] indicates a single time instant. A property of the form ''prop1 U[time] prop2'' is true for a path if time defines an interval of real values and the path is such that prop2 becomes true at a time instant which falls within the interval and prop1 is true in all time instants up to that point. The second query concerns the proportion of the protein in monomer form (P) relative to the total quantity of the protein (i.e. P +P2). In order to define this property, we need a reward structure.</p><p>State rewards can be specified using multiple reward items, each of the form ''guard:reward;'', where guard is a predicate and reward is an expression. States of the model which satisfy the predicate in the guard are assigned the corresponding reward. Specifically, in our case we define the reward: The letter ''R'' indicates that the property refers to a reward structure. The results of the two queries are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we have presented Bio-PEPA, a modification of the process algebra PEPA, for the modelling and the analysis of biochemical networks. Bio-PEPA allows us to represent explicitly some features of biochemical networks, such as stoichiometry and general kinetic laws. Thus not only elementary reactions with constant rates, but also complex reactions described by general kinetic laws can be considered. The potential to consider various kinds of kinetic laws allows us to model a vast number of biochemical networks. Indeed complex reactions are frequently found in models as abstractions of sequences of elementary steps and reducing to elementary reactions is often impossible and undesirable.</p><p>Bio-PEPA has been enriched with some notions of equivalence. We have presented definitions of isomorphism and strong bisimulation which are similar to the relations defined for PEPA in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. These equivalences are quite strict. Further investigation concerns the definition of other forms of equivalence, more appropriate for studying biological systems.</p><p>A principal feature of Bio-PEPA is the possibility of mapping the system to different kinds of analyses. In this work we have shown how to derive a CTMC with levels from a Bio-PEPA system and we have discussed the derivation of ODEs, stochastic simulation and PRISM models. Indeed Bio-PEPA has been defined as an intermediate language for the formal representation of the model. We have extended the definition of CTMC with levels, defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, to the case of general kinetic laws and to different levels for the species. The main benefit of this approach with respect to stochastic simulation is the reduction in state space which leaves models amenable to numerical solution and model checking. Compared with ODE-based analysis the important stochastic aspect of behaviour is retained. The approach is based on some assumptions. Firstly, all the species must have a finite maximum concentration. This is to ensure a finite state space in the corresponding CTMC, making numerical solution feasible. However, we can have a species without a limiting value. In these cases we can consider a maximum level for the values greater than a certain (high) value. A second point concerns the assumption that all the species have the same step size. This may be a problem when the species can have maximum concentrations belonging to different concentration scales; some species may have only a few levels whereas others may have many. Furthermore, some species (for instance genes) are present in the system only in few copies and in this case the representation in terms of continuous concentration is wrong. In order to handle this situation, Bio-PEPA could be enriched with discrete variables. The possibility to consider different step sizes and discrete variables is a topic for future work.</p><p>The different kinds of analyses proposed for Bio-PEPA are strongly related. Another area for further work will concern a deeper study of these relationships, in particular for the CTMC with levels and Gillespie's stochastic simulation.</p><p>An outstanding problem is the application of Gillespie's stochastic simulation with general kinetic laws. Indeed the original definition of the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> is based on the assumption of elementary reactions. However recently there have been some extensions to handle reactions with general kinetic laws and with more than two reactants. The approach proposed in this work is to use Gillespie's algorithm also in the general context, but to be careful about the interpretation of the results. The validation of the model against experimental data and prior knowledge is extremely important in this situation. In particular, if we obtain results different from the ones expected, the problem could be in the application of Gillespie's algorithm with the reactions present in the model.</p><p>In Bio-PEPA compartments are assumed to be static and are simply represented by names. This choice is motivated by the fact that, even though compartments play an important role in biological systems, at present the available quantitative information about them is poor. Most biochemical networks in the literature and databases (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>) describe static compartments and often are based on strong assumptions. For example, all compartments are assumed to have the same volume or all the species are well-mixed when in reality they are not. In the present work we fix our attention to these kinds of networks and Bio-PEPA is able to represent most features of them. We are also working on an extension of the language in order to model a more general definition of compartments. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> the language has been extended with some more features to represent locations of species and reactions and compartments can vary their size with time.</p><p>Finally, a tool for the analysis of biochemical networks using Bio-PEPA is under implementation and a translation from SBML into Bio-PEPA is planned.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
