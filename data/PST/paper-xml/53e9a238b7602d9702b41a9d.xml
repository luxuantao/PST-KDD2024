<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Camera spectral sensitivities are functions of wavelength describing the relative efficiency of light detection for color filters and image sensors. It relates scene radiance with recorded RGB values for a digital color camera. The knowledge of camera spectral sensitivities is important for many computer vision tasks that use color information, such as multispectral imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, color constancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, and spectral reflectance recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>Camera spectral sensitivities are often measured with a monochromator that generates narrow-band light and a spectrophotometer that measures its spectral power distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This method, however, is applicable only in a laboratory setting, with a time-consuming scanning over the wavelength range of interest. Recent approaches simplify the recovery of camera spectral sensitivities by using specialized targets such as a fluorescent checker <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, a LED-based emissive chart <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, or multiple instead of a single picture of a color target <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Nevertheless, it is assumed <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> that camera spectral sensitivities cannot be reliably recovered by using regular broadband reflective color targets (e.g., color checker) even with known illumi-nation. The reason is that real-world spectral reflectance has a lower intrinsic dimensionality than the number of unknowns of camera spectral sensitivities. The requirement of specialized devices or targets has become a hurdle for the estimation of camera spectral sensitivities, because compared to fluorescent or LED-based color targets, reflective color targets are still much more stable and easier to manufacture, maintain, and use.</p><p>On the other hand, for most digital color cameras, spectral sensitivity functions are designed with certain constraints in mind, which means they may reside in some low dimensional space. For instance, most digital color cameras are designed to make 'nice' pictures and the characteristics of the camera spectral sensitivities are a trade-off between maximizing quantum efficiency and minimizing noise.</p><p>Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we ask the question: what is the space of spectral sensitivity functions for digital color cameras? Finding a low-dimensional, statistical model for camera spectral sensitivities is useful for estimating them with fewer constraints. With this goal, our contributions in this paper are as follows:</p><p>• We have measured a database of spectral sensitivity functions for 28 cameras, including professional DSLRs, point-and-shoot, industrial and mobile cameras, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1</ref>. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive database of this kind so far. The database and source codes are available at http: //www.cis.rit.edu/jwgu. • We perform principal component analysis (PCA) on this database and find that the space of camera spectral sensitivities is two dimensional. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Estimation of Camera Spectral Sensitivity Camera spectral sensitivities are usually measured using a monochromator and a spectrometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, with a timeconsuming scanning over the wavelength range of interest.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) suffers even with a small amount of noise (1%) due to the low dimensionality of spectral reflectance of real-world objects. The subscripts m and e stand for the measured and estimated camera spectral sensitivities. This method is accurate but expensive. Hardeberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed to estimate the camera spectral sensitivities with known illumination and scene reflectance, but they found it unreliable due to the low intrinsic dimensionality of scene spectral reflectance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. To overcome this, Urban et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> took multiple pictures of a color target under different LED illuminations. Dicarlo et al. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> proposed to use a LED-based emissive target, and recently Han et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed to use a fluorescent color target.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis of Camera Response Functions</head><p>Our work is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that performed statistical analysis of camera radiometric response functions. Similar analysis has been performed for the spectra of daylight <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> and used for illumination and spectral reflectance recov-ery <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. For camera spectral sensitivity functions, Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> collected data for 12 cameras and compared four types of basis functions to model camera spectral sensitivities. They found the radial basis function optimal for recovering camera spectral sensitivities. In comparison, with more data, we find the PCA-based model more accurate. We also propose to recover spectral sensitivities from a single image under unknown illumination.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Statistical Analysis of Spectral Sensitivity Functions for Digital Color Cameras</head><p>We first introduce some background and show why it is necessary for statistical analysis of camera spectral sensitivities. The RGB triplet pixel intensities at one spatial position x, I k,x , k = R, G, B, can be modeled as the product of the spectral reflectance of the point R x (λ), the spectral power distribution of the illuminant L(λ), and the camera spectral sensitivities C k (λ), k = R, G, B, integrating over the visible spectral range from 400nm to 720 nm,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I k,x = 720nm 400nm C k (λ)L(λ)R x (λ) dλ, k = R, G, B. (1)</formula><p>These equations can also be written in a matrix form, i k = c k LR, k = R, G, B, where i k is a 1 × m vector (m is the number of pixels), c k is a 1 × 33 vector (assuming we have 33 bands from 400nm to 720nm with an interval of 10nm),</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L = diag(L(400nm), • • • , L(720nm)), and R = [r 1 , • • • , r m ], (r m = [R m (400nm), • • • , R m (720nm)] T ).</formula><p>To estimate camera spectral sensitivities</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C = [c R , c G , c B ]</formula><p>T , (T is the transpose of the matrix), in the-ory we can take a picture of color patches with known reflectance, R, under a known illuminant, and solve with pseudo-inverse</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">c k = i k • (LR) + , k = R, G, B.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In practice, however, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, direct inversion cannot reliably recover camera spectral sensitivities. Even when we use 1269 Munsell color chips as the color target, direct inversion is still quite sensitive to noise. As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, this is because spectral reflectance of realworld objects has a low intrinsic dimensionality (i.e., 6 or 8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> which makes R rank deficient. To overcome the problem, recent work <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> used either narrow-band LED illumination or fluorescent color targets. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to solve this problem with reflective color targets, because they are easier to manufacture, maintain, and use. We show below that with statistical analysis of camera spectral sensitivity functions, we can find a low dimensional model of spectral sensitivities and solve this problem from a single image under unknown illumination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Assumptions and Constraints for Camera Spectral Sensitivity Functions</head><p>In this paper, we are interested in the spectral sensitivity functions of digital color cameras in the visible spectrum (i.e., 400nm to 720nm). To unify our discussion, we make the assumptions and constraints listed below.</p><p>• We assume the spectral sensitivity functions of a camera is spatially invariant, i.e., they are functions of wavelength only:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C k (λ), k = R, G, B.</formula><p>• We also assume the spectral sensitivity functions are non-negative,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">C k (λ) ≥ 0, k = R, G, B.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In addition, we normalize the spectral sensitivity function of each color channel to be between zero and one,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">max λ C k,n (λ) = 1, k = R, G, B,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where c k,n is the normalized spectral sensitivity, and <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The absolute magnitudes of spectral sensitivities can be accounted by gain of an imaging system and thus can be excluded for modeling spectral sensitivities. Note that our normalization is different from previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> where only the peak of C G (λ) is normalized to one. We normalize such that the peak of all RGB channels to one, because we aim to use statistical models to explain the spread rather than the height variation of spectral sensitivity functions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">c k = g k • c k,n , g k ≥ 0, k = R, G, B.</formula><p>• To faithfully capture the color of a scene, in theory, cameras need to satisfy the Luther condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, i.e., the camera spectral sensitivity functions need to be a linear transformation of the CIE-1931 2-degree color matching functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">  x ȳ z  = T   c R c G c B   ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">[x, ȳ, z] T is the CIE-1931 2-degree color matching function, [c R , c G , c B ]</formula><p>T are the spectral sensitivities of a digital color camera, and T is a full-rank 3 × 3 matrix to be determined. In practice, however, due to limitations in hardware (e.g., color filters in the Bayer pattern), the Luther condition is often satisfied to a certain degree, especially for low-end consumergrade cameras.</p><p>Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">3</ref>), (4), and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>) define the space of spectral sensitivity functions of digital color cameras. It is easy to see this space is a convex set. If C 1 and C 2 are in this set, any convex combination aC 1 + (1a)C 2 , 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 must also be in this set. Below, we measured spectral sensitivity functions for a wide range of cameras and performed statistical analysis to chart the space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Database of Camera Spectral Sensitivity</head><p>We have measured the spectral sensitivity functions for 28 cameras using a monochromator and a spectrometer PR655. The measurement setup and details can be found in the supplementary materials.</p><p>The raw measured data, after normalization, is in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1</ref>. Most spectral sensitivity functions peak at similar wavelength for each channel. To validate whether they satisfy the Luther condition, we estimate the matrix T with least square based on Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>). The spectral Root Mean Square (RMS) error, ||C 2deg -T • C||, is used for evaluation, where C 2deg is a matrix of the CIE-1931 2-degree color matching function, and C are the measured camera spectral sensitivities. Color difference (CIEDE00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) is also calculated between C 2deg and T • C under CIE D65 illuminant for the 1269 Munsell color chips <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Ideally, both the spectral RMS and color difference are zero if a camera perfectly satisfies Luther condition. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, however, overall most cameras have a deviation from the Luther condition, especially for the two industrial cameras. It also shows that Canon cameras in general have lower RMS and color differences than Nikon cameras in this aspect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">A PCA Model for Camera Spectral Sensitivity</head><p>We performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the normalized data for each color channel separately. In our database, we have 9 Canon and 10 Nikon cameras, and  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>), C 2deg are the CIE-1931 2-degree color matching functions, and C are the measured camera spectral sensitivities.

Ideally, spectral RMS and color differences are zero if a camera perfectly satisfies the Luther condition. Overall, most cameras have a deviation from the Luther condition, especially for the two industrial cameras. 9 other cameras. PCA was performed on all Canon cameras, all Nikon cameras, and all 28 cameras to investigate the difference across different types of cameras. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>. When all 28 cameras are used, the 1st principal component explains over 95% of total variance of the data, and the first two principal components explain over 97%, which means camera spectral sensitivities can be modeled as a two-dimensional space with reasonably high accuracy (which is also confirmed by our recovered results and applications). In other words, camera spectral sensitivities can be decomposed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">c k,n = σ k • E k , k = R, G, B, where σ = [σ 1 , σ 2 ] is a 1 × 2 vector, E k = [e k,1 , e k,2</formula><p>] T is 2 × 33, the eigenvector matrix.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">with a Known Light Source</head><p>If the spectrum of a light source is known, we can capture an image of a reflective color target (e.g., color checker) and recover camera spectral sensitivities by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">g k σ k = i k (E k LR) + , k = R, G, B.</formula><p>The camera spectral sensitivities can be obtained by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">c k = g k c k,n = g k σ k E k = i k (E k LR) + E k , k = R, G, B.<label>(7)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">with an Unknown Light Source</head><p>If the spectrum of a light is unknown but we know it is daylight, we show both the spectrum of daylight and the camera spectral sensitivities can be recovered, by using the daylight spectrum model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This daylight model is represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L(λ, t) = L(λ) + M 1 (t)V 1 (λ) + M 2 (t)V 2 (λ),</formula><p>where M 1 and M 2 are functions of correlated color temperature (t), L(λ) is the average daylight spectrum, and V 1 (λ) and V 2 (λ) are the characteristic vectors of daylight.

The recovery of spectral sensitivities of more cameras can be found in the supplementary materials. We also evaluated this method under daylight at different time of the day in the supplementary material, which confirms the method stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Comparison with Other Basis Functions</head><p>We also compare this PCA model with three other basis functions for modeling camera spectral sensitivities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, including Fourier, radial, and polynomial basis. Details of these basis functions are in the supplementary material.</p><p>Using the same captured image (Fig. <ref type="figure">6(c</ref>)), we recover camera spectral sensitivities with the four types of basis functions, respectively. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, the results are not as accurate as that by using the PCA model (Fig. <ref type="figure">6(f)</ref>). We also use the recovered camera spectral sensitivities to simulate the rendering of a color checker under D65 illuminant. In Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, the PCA model outperforms other basis functions, resulting in the smallest color difference overall. We also evaluate the robustness to noise when recovering camera spectral sensitivities with the four types of basis functions over the entire database (i.e., 28 cameras). The proposed PCA model is more robust to noise, with the smallest RMS error in the recovery in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, contradicting with that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We believe the reason is that our PCA model is derived with more data (i.e., 28 vs 12 cameras).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Applications</head><p>In this section, we show two applications after the recovery of camera spectral sensitivity functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Simulation of Color Rendering for Cameras</head><p>A straightforward application is to simulate the color rendering of a multi-spectral image for cameras, i.e., generating a RGB image for certain camera models. This is useful for the design and evaluation of cameras. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> shows an example where renderings are made using the measured and recovered camera spectral sensitivities of Canon 60D. The multispectral images are from the database <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Color difference is calculated, and they are close to one, indicating the accuracy of the recovered camera spectral sensitivities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Computational Color Constancy</head><p>Knowing camera spectral sensitivities is also useful for computational color constancy <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, i.e., removing the overall color cast in captured images. In order to recover the correct color of a scene, camera raw data needs to be converted to device-independent XYZ by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>), and then a chromatic adaptation transform is used to take care of the difference in the white point. A simple way to calculate the scene white point is</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">[X Y Z] T w = T • [R G B] T w , where [R G B] T</formula><p>w is the radiance of a white Lambertian area in the picture. A linear Bradford chromatic adaptation transform is used to convert to CIE D65, the white point of sRGB color space by default <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Computational color constancy relies on the accurate estimation of T (by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>)) and the white point of the scene. Knowing camera spectral sensitivities can help us estimate the matrix T correctly. with the ground truth (E). A color checker is rendered under D65 with camera spectral sensitivities recovered using these basis functions, and converted to sRGB. The average color difference between the renderings (from A to D) and the ground truth (E) are 1.59, 3.54, 2.43 and 7. The gain of the imaging system remains the same for all four basis functions. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The spectral RMS between the measured and recovered camera spectral sensitivities using four types of basis functions. For polynomial, Fourier, and radial, 8 basis functions are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. At all noise levels, the PCA model outperforms other basis functions.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>, the picture captured by Canon 5D Mark II, whose camera spectral sensitivities were estimated using a single picture under unknown daylight. T was obtained by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>) using the estimated camera spectral sensitivities. The corrected image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10(b)</ref>) is based on the T matrix.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The values in the parentheses are the average color difference (CIEDE00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) between the bottom and top images in each column. For all three examples, the color difference is close to one, indicating a close color match.</p><p>Without camera spectral sensitivities, one of the methods to correct the images is to divide the white point RGB as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10(c)</ref>. By comparing the two corrected images, the color is more saturated and natural in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10(b</ref>) based on the recovered camera spectral sensitivities. More examples can be found in the supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussions</head><p>In this paper, we explored the space of spectral sensitivity functions for digital color cameras. We measured a database of 28 cameras. We found the space of camera spectral sensitivities to be convex and two-dimensional. Based on the statistical model, we propose two methods to recover camera spectral sensitivities from a single image with and without knowing the illumination. Compared to other basis functions, we find the PCA-based model more accurate and robust to noise. We also showed several applications with the recovery of camera spectral sensitivities.</p><p>The proposed method also has limitations. First, spurious measurements or outliers in the database may cause errors in the learned PCA model. Functional PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> may be used to overcome this problem. Second, our method assumes we have access to camera raw data to ensure the linearity. When this assumption does not hold, both camera response function and camera spectral sensitivities have to be estimated simultaneously.</p><p>The proposed method works well under unknown daylight. Next, we are interested in the recovery of camera spectral sensitivities under general unknown illumination such as indoor overhead light or mixed lighting. Finally, we are also interested in applying the statistical model of camera spectral sensitivities to infer some spectral information for Internet photos.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Robustness of Spectral Sensitivity Recovery to Daylight Variation</head><p>Judd <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> proposed that the daylight spectrum can be well represented using only a few parameters. To fully evaluate our recovery of camera spectral sensitivity under daylight, we simulated radiance using daylight measured at different time of the day, based on which the camera spectral sensitivity is recovered. The measured and recovered camera spectral sensitivity was then compared and spectral RMS calculated. The mean RMS for all 28 cameras in the database </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Dimensionality of Spectral Sensitivity</head><p>While the camera spectral sensitivity is of high dimension (i.e.33 if the wavelength ranges from 400nm to 720nm with an interval of 10nm), it can be represented using much fewer parameters. The variance that can be explained given the number of eigenvectors retained in the model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. With two eigenvectors, we found that the camera spectral sensitivity can be well represented. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results on Spectral Sensitivity Recovery</head><p>We recovered the camera spectral sensitivity of NikonD3 using a picture of CCDC under unknown daylight. The radiance error given the CCT of daylight is in Fig. <ref type="figure">6(a)</ref>. The daylight spectrum that yields the least radiance eror is selected, and it is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(b) with the measured daylight spectrum. A close match can be found between our recovered daylight and the ground truth. The recovered and measured camera spectral sensitivity are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6(c</ref>). Similarly, the camera spectral sensitivity of a smartphone camera, NokiaN900, and another DSLR, Canon5D Mark II are recovered in Fig. ??.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Results on Computational Color Constancy</head><p>Accurate color corrections of images can be made by knowing the camera spectral sensitivity. In order to recover the correct color of a scene, camera raw data needs to be converted to device-independent XYZ by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>) in the paper, and then a chromatic adaptation transform (i.e.a linear Bradford transform) is used to take care of the difference in the white point. Computational color constancy relies on the accurate estimation of T (by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>)) and the white point of the scene. Knowing camera spectral sensitivity can help estimate T correctly. Examples are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. The color cast in the captured images in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> is removed successfully by knowing T estimated from the recovered camera spectral sensitivity of Canon 5D MarkII. On the other hand, the corrected images are less saturated by dividing the white point (without knowing the T matrix).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure1. The normalized spectral sensitivities of the 28 cameras in our database, including professional DSLRs, point-and-shoot, industrial and mobile cameras.

A camera satisfies the Luther condition if its spectral sensitivity function is a linear transformation of the CIE-1931 2-degree color matching function. The Luther condition can be evaluated by the RMS error between C 2deg and T • C, where T is computed by Eq. (5), C 2deg are the CIE-1931 2-degree color matching functions, and C are the measured camera spectral sensitivities. Color difference (CIEDE00<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) is calculated between C 2deg and T • C under CIE D65 illuminant and the 1269 Munsell color chips<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Ideally, spectral RMS and color differences are zero if a camera perfectly satisfies the Luther condition. Overall, most cameras have a deviation from the Luther condition, especially for the two industrial cameras.</figDesc></figure>

The 1st principal component accounts for over 95% of total variance for all three channels, and the first two principal components accounts for over 97% of total variance.
