<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a distribution-free model of incomplete-information games, both with and without private information, in which the players use a robust optimization approach to contend with payoff uncertainty. Our "robust game" model relaxes the assumptions of Harsanyi's Bayesian game model, and provides an alternative distribution-free equilibrium concept, which we call "robust-optimization equilibrium," to that of the ex post equilibrium. We prove that the robust-optimization equilibria of an incomplete-information game subsume the ex post equilibria of the game and are, unlike the latter, guaranteed to exist when the game is finite and has bounded payoff uncertainty set. For arbitrary robust finite games with bounded polyhedral payoff uncertainty sets, we show that we can compute a robust-optimization equilibrium by methods analogous to those for identifying a Nash equilibrium of a finite game with complete information. In addition, we present computational results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Finite games with complete information</head><p>Game theory is a field in economics that examines multi-agent decision problems, in which the rewards to each agent, or player, can depend not only on his action, but also on the actions of the other players. In his seminal paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, John Nash introduced the notion of an equilibrium of a game. He defined an equilibrium as a profile of players' strategies, such that no player has incentive to unilaterally deviate from his strategy, given the strategies of the other players.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, Nash focused on non-cooperative, simultaneous-move, one-shot, finite games with complete information, a class of games encompassing various situations in economics. "Simultaneous-move" refers to the fact that the players choose strategies without knowing those selected by the other players. "One-shot" means that the game is played only once. "Finite" connotes that there are a finite number of players, each having a finite number of actions, over which mixed strategies in these actions may be defined. Finally, "complete information" implies that all parameters of the game, including individual players' payoff functions, are common knowledge.</p><p>In his analysis, Nash modeled each player as rational and wanting to maximize his expected payoff with respect to the probability distributions given by the mixed strategies. Nash proved that each game of the aforementioned type has an equilibrium in mixed strategies. In fact, Nash gave two existence proofs, one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> based on Kakutani's Fixed Point Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> based on the less general Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Nash's equilibrium concept and existence theorem have become a cornerstone in the field of game theory and earned him the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics. The concept is regarded as practically significant largely because, under the standard assumptions that players are rational and that the structure of a game is common knowledge, the concept offers a possible approach to predicting the outcome of the game. The argument is as follows. Any rational player who thinks his opponents will use certain strategies should never play anything other than a best response to those strategies. By the common knowledge assumption, the other players know this, the player knows that the other players know this, etc., ad infinitum. Thus, the players may be able to reach consistent predictions of what each other will play. The classical game theory literature concludes from this observation that we should expect the realized behavior in a game to belong to the set of equilibria. As discussed in the introduction of Fudenberg and Levine <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, in practice, this conclusion can prove to be unreliable. Nonetheless, the concept of Nash equilibrium remains the central idea in game theory, in part because no solution concept has been offered that overcomes these prediction issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Finite games with incomplete information</head><p>While the existence of an equilibrium can be asked in any game, Nash's existence result addresses only non-cooperative, simultaneous-move, one-shot, finite games with complete information. Of course, in real-world, game-theoretic situations, players are often uncertain of some aspects of the structure of the game, such as payoff functions.</p><p>Harsanyi <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> modeled these incomplete-information games as what he called "Bayesian games." He defined a player's "type" as an encoding of information available to that player, including knowledge of his own payoff function and beliefs about other players' payoff functions. In this way, he used type spaces to model incomplete-information games, in which some players may have private information. He assumed that the players share a common-knowledge prior probability distribution over the type space. Harsanyi suggested that each player would use this prior probability distribution, together with his type, to derive a conditional probability distribution on the parameter values remaining unknown to him. Furthermore, he assumed that each player's goal would then be to, using a Bayesian approach in this way, maximize his expected payoff with respect to both the aforementioned conditional probability distribution and the mixed strategies of the players.</p><p>In this framework, Harsanyi extended Nash's result to games with incomplete information. In particular, he showed that any Bayesian game is equivalent to an extensiveform game with complete, but imperfect information. This extensive-form game, in turn, is known to have a static-form representation. Using an equilibrium existence result more general than Nash's and due to Debreu <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Harsanyi thus proved the existence of equilibria, which he called "Bayesian equilibria," in Bayesian games. For his work on games with incomplete information, he won the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics, alongside Nash and Selten.</p><p>Harsanyi's work relaxes the assumption that all parameters affecting the payoffs of the players are known with certainty. His model technique is essentially analogous to the stochastic programming approach to data uncertainty in mathematical optimization problems. As in stochastic programming, Harsanyi's model assumes the availability of full prior distributional information for all unknown parameters. In addition, his analysis assumes that all players use the same prior, and that this fact is common knowledge. Many, including Morris <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and Wilson <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, have questioned the common prior and common knowledge aspects of these assumptions. Nonetheless, Harsanyi's Bayesian model remains the accepted convention for analyzing static games with incomplete information.</p><p>Some contributions to the literature have relaxed the common prior and common knowledge assumptions of Harsanyi's model. Most importantly, Mertens and Zamir <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> formalized the notion of a "universal type space," a type space large enough to capture players' higher-order beliefs, players' use of different prior probability distributions on the uncertain parameters, and the absence of common knowledge of these priors.</p><p>Taking a different approach, other contributors to the game theory literature have offered distribution-free equilibrium concepts for incomplete-information games. These analyses address the possibility that distributional information is not available to the players, or that they opt not to use potentially inaccurate distributional information. The notion of an ex post equilibrium is the most common distribution-free solution concept and is especially prevalent in the auction theory literature. Holmström and Myerson <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> first introduced this notion under the name "uniform incentive compatibility," and Crémer and McLean <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> first used it in the context of auctions. The ex post equilibrium is a refinement of the Bayesian equilibrium and is an appealing solution concept, because it is relevant even when the players lack distributional information on the uncertain parameters. However, it is a strong concept, and ex post equilibria need not exist in an incomplete-information game.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Contributions and structure of the paper</head><p>The contributions of this paper are as follows.</p><p>1. We propose a distribution-free, robust optimization model for incomplete-information games. Our model relaxes the assumptions of Harsanyi's Bayesian games model, and at the same time provides a more general equilibrium concept than that of the ex post equilibrium. Specifically, in Section 2, we review relevant results from the literature on robust optimization. In Section 3, we formally propose the robust optimization model for non-cooperative, simultaneous-move, one-shot, finite games with incomplete information. We start by discussing precedents, from the game theory literature, for using a worst-case approach to uncertainty, in the absence of probability distributions.</p><p>We then note the novelty of our approach with respect to these works. After setting forth our model, we describe the "robust games," analogous to Harsanyi's Bayesian games, to which this approach gives rise. We compare the equilibrium conditions for such robust games to those for Bayesian equilibria and ex post equilibria. Furthermore, we note that any ex post equilibria of an incomplete-information game are what we call "robust-optimization equilibria," i.e., equilibria of the corresponding robust game, just as they are Bayesian equilibria under Harsanyi's model. We then discuss our union of the notion of equilibrium with the robust optimization paradigm, and we give interpretations of mixed strategies in the context of robust games. We relate this discussion and these interpretations to those in the literature on complete-information games.</p><p>At the end of Section 3, to concretize the idea of a robust game, we present some examples. In addition, we use one of these examples to illustrate that ex post equilibria need not exist, thereby motivating the need for an alternate distribution-free equilibrium concept.</p><p>Let us pause to note that, for the sake of simplicity, in Sections 3 through 6, we focus on situations of uncertainty in which no player has private information. This focus allows for a clearer and a sufficiently rich discussion of the main ideas underlying our model and results, without hindering the reader's understanding through the use of cumbersome notation and references to results from the theory of Banach spaces. Such notation and results are required for the general case of incomplete-information games involving potentially private information. In Section 7, we extend our analysis to this general case. 2. In Section 4, we prove the existence of equilibria in robust finite games with bounded uncertainty sets and no private information. 3. In Section 5, we formulate the set of equilibria of an arbitrary robust finite game, with bounded polyhedral uncertainty set and no private information, as the dimensionreducing, component-wise projection of the solution set of a system of multilinear equalities and inequalities. We provide a general method for approximately computing sample robust-optimization equilibria, and we present numerical results from the application of this method. For a special class of such games, we show equivalence to finite games with complete payoff information and the same action spaces. As a result, in order to compute sample equilibria for robust games in this class, one need only solve for the equilibria of the corresponding complete-information game. 4. In Section 6, we compare properties of robust finite games with those of the corresponding complete-information games, in which the uncertain payoff parameters of the former are commonly known to take fixed, nominal values. In the absence of private information, these nominal games are precisely the Bayesian games arising from attributing symmetric probability distributions over the uncertainty sets of the corresponding robust games. In addition, turning our attention to a notion of symmetry unrelated to the symmetry of probability distributions, we extend the definition of a symmetric game, i.e., one in which the players are indistinguishable with respect to the structure of the game, to the robust game setting. We prove the existence of symmetric equilibria in symmetric, robust finite games with bounded uncertainty sets and no private information.</p><p>5. In Section 7, we generalize our model to the case with potentially private information. We extend our existence result to this context and generalize our computation method to such situations involving private information and finite type spaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Notation</head><p>We will use the following notation conventions throughout the paper. Boldface letters will denote vectors and matrices. In general, upper case letters will signify matrices, while lower case will denote vectors. To designate uncertain coefficients and their nominal counterparts, we will use the tilde (e.g., ã) and the check (e.g., ǎ), respectively. Lastly, vec(A) will denote the column vector obtained by stacking the row vectors of the matrix A one on top of another. Thus, if A is an m × n matrix, vec(A) will be an mn × 1 vector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Review of robust linear optimization</head><p>For the purpose of more precisely characterizing the robust optimization approach, let us consider the mathematical optimization problem (MP)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P : max x f (x) s.t. x ∈ X( δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δω ),</formula><p>where x is the vector of decision variables, X(δ 1 , δ 2 , . . . , δ ω ) is the feasible region defined by parameters δ i , i ∈ {1, . . . , ω}, and f (x) is the objective function. In the above nominal MP, we regard the parameter values as being fixed at δ i = δi , i ∈ {1, . . . , ω}.</p><p>Suppose instead that we do not know the exact values of these parameters δ1 , . . . , δω , but know that ( δ1 , . . . , δω ) belongs to some uncertainty set U . Under this model of uncertainty, the robust counterpart of the above nominal problem is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">RP : max x f (x) s.t. x ∈ X( δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δω ), ∀ ( δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δω ) ∈ U.</formula><p>Without loss of generality, we can restrict our discussion of data uncertainty to the constraints, since the objective can always be incorporated into the constraints. Indeed, the nominal problem P can be rewritten as a maximization over a new decision variable, z.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">max x,z z s.t. z ≤ f (x)</formula><p>x ∈ X( δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δω ). Initial results on robust linear optimization were given by Soyster in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Soyster considered linear optimization problems (LPs) subject to column-wise uncertainty in the constraint matrix. His model is equivalent to the LP in which all uncertain parameters have been fixed at their worst-case values from the uncertainty set. Soyster's model is overly conservative; in practice, it seems quite unlikely that the uncertain parameters would all simultaneously realize their worst-case values. In addition, his model is specific to column-wise uncertainty and does not easily generalize.</p><p>Twenty years later, Ben-Tal and Nemirovski <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and, independently of them, El Ghaoui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> renewed the discussion of optimization under uncertainty. They examined ellipsoidal models of uncertainty, which, for the robust LP case, are less conservative than the column-wise model considered by Soyster. They showed that the robust counterpart of an LP under such ellipsoidal uncertainty models is a second-order cone optimization problem (SOCP). Furthermore, they remarked that polyhedral uncertainty can be regarded as a special case of ellipsoidal uncertainty. As a result, LPs under polyhedral uncertainty of the coefficient matrix can be solved via SOCPs.</p><p>Ellipsoidal uncertainty formulations of robustness are attractive in that they offer a reduced level of conservatism, as compared with the Soyster model, and lead to efficient solutions, via SOCPs, of LPs under uncertainty. Unfortunately, ellipsoidal uncertainty formulations give rise to robust counterparts whose exact solution is more computationally demanding than that of the corresponding nominal problem. In response to this drawback, Bertsimas and Sim <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> offered an alternative model of uncertainty, under which the robust counterpart of an LP is an LP. Their formulation yields essentially the same level of conservatism as do those of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski and El Ghaoui et al.</p><p>Bertsimas, Pachamanova, and Sim <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> further extended the results of Bertsimas and Sim <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to the case of general polyhedral uncertainty of the coefficient matrix. In particular, where Ã is an m × n coefficient matrix, they modeled the uncertainty set as a polyhedron</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">U = vec( Ã) G • vec( Ã) ≤ d , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where G ∈ R ×mn , vec( Ã) ∈ R mn×1 , and d ∈ R . They considered the robust LP given by max</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x c x s.t. Ãx ≤ b (2) x ∈ S ∀ Ã ∈ U,</formula><p>where x ∈ R n is the decision vector and S is a polyhedron defined by constraints that are not subject to uncertainty. They showed that, if the number of constraints defining S is r, then robust LP <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> in n variables and m + r constraints is equivalent to a nominal LP in n + m variables and m 2 n + m + m + r constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A robust approach to payoff uncertainty in games</head><p>As an alternative to Harsanyi's model and the notion of the ex post equilibrium, we propose a new distribution-free model of and equilibrium concept for incomplete-information games. Our model is based on robust optimization, in which one takes a deterministic approach to uncertainty and seeks to optimize worst-case performance, where the worst case is taken with respect to a set of possible values for the uncertain parameters. Let us note that, in Sections 3 through 6, we will focus on incomplete-information games without private information. In Section 7, we will extend our analysis to the general case involving potentially private information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Precedents for a worst-case approach</head><p>In fact, the game theory literature is ripe with precedents for using a worst-case approach. The field arose in large part from von Neumann's and Morgenstern's "max-min" formulation of behavior in games <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. More recently, for example, Goldberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed a worst-case, competitive-analysis approach to auction mechanism design. In the more general context of games in normal form, several authors, including Gilboa and Schmeidler <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, Dow and Werlang <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Klibanoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, Lo <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and Marinacci <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, have argued for a max-min-based approach to "ambiguous uncertainty," uncertainty in the absence of probabilistic information. They contend that expected utility models are well-suited for decision-theoretic situations characterized by "risk," uncertainty with distributional information, but that these models do not capture behavior observed in practice in situations of ambiguous uncertainty. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> As Dow and Werlang <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> note, the former type of uncertainty is exemplified by the outcome of a coin toss, while the latter is typified by the outcome of a horse race.</p><p>While the max-min approaches of Gilboa and Schmeidler, Dow and Werlang, Klibanoff, Lo, and Marinacci share the worst-case perspective of our model, their approaches are fundamentally different from ours for at least three reasons. First, these authors consider complete-information games, whereas we address incomplete-information games. In their models, players know, with certainty, the payoffs under given tuples of actions, but do not know which tuple of actions will be played. In our model, the players may be uncertain of the payoffs, even under given tuples of actions. Accordingly, the aforementioned authors use a pessimistic approach to model each player's uncertainty of the other players' behaviors, whereas we use a worst-case approach to model each player's uncertainty of the payoff functions themselves.</p><p>Second, although these authors take a worst-case approach to some extent, their models are nonetheless inherently probabilistic, unlike our approach, which is fundamentally deterministic. Klibanoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and Lo <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> model each player's uncertainty of the other players' behaviors using the notion of multiple prior probability distributions. They characterize each player as believing his counterparts'actions are a realization from some unknown probability distribution, belonging to a family of known multiple priors. Each player then seeks to maximize his minimum expected utility, where the minimum is taken with respect to this set of multiple priors. Gilboa and Schmeidler <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, Dow and Werlang <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and Marinacci <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> propose a related approach using non-additive probability distributions in place of sets of multiple priors. Unlike these authors, we offer a model in which the players give no consideration whatsoever to probability distributions over the uncertain values. Under our approach, the players regard the uncertain values as simply unknown and not as realizations from some probability distribution, even a distribution that is itself not exactly known. Consequently, our model of the players' responses to uncertainty is distribution-free and deterministic in nature.</p><p>Third, these authors offer no guidelines for equilibria computation in the context of their models. In contrast, in Section 5, we propose such a computation method. Despite these differences, the aforementioned authors' contributions provide ample support for the robust optimization model we propose for games with incomplete information.</p><p>In addition, since the submission of our paper, Hyafil and Boutilier <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> have recently offered a worst-case approach for incomplete-information games, based on the distribution-free decision criterion of minimax regret, popular in the online optimization literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Their approach is in contrast to our framework of modeling the players as each seeking to maximize his worst-case expected payoff. Hyafil and Boutilier provide an existence result for a very restricted, special case of incomplete-information games, involving private information, but finite type spaces. They offer no ideas on computation of their equilibria.</p><p>Having discussed some precedents for taking a worst-case approach to analyzing game-theoretic situations, let us now formalize our robust games model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Formalization of the robust game model</head><p>In our robust optimization model of incomplete-information games, we assume that the players commonly know only an uncertainty set of possible values of the uncertain payoff function parameters. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> They need not, as Harsanyi's model additionally assumes, have distributional information for this uncertainty set. In addition, we suppose that each player uses a robust optimization, and therefore a worst-case, approach to the uncertainty, rather than seeking, as in Harsanyi's model, to optimize "average" performance with respect to a distribution over the uncertainty set. In the game theory literature, the "performance" of a player's mixed strategy is measured by his expected payoff. Accordingly, in our model, given the other players' strategies, each player seeks to maximize his worst-case expected payoff. The worst-case is taken with respect to the uncertainty set, and the expectation is taken, as in complete-information games, over the mixed strategies of the players. Analogous to Harsanyi's "Bayesian game" terminology, we call the resulting games "robust games," and we refer to their equilibria as "robust-optimization equilibria" of the corresponding incomplete-information games.</p><p>In this section we will formalize our robust game model and its relation to Nash's and Harsanyi's models for the complete-and incomplete-information settings, respectively. We will also compare the notion of ex post equilibrium with the concept of robust-optimization equilibrium.</p><p>Let us first define some terms and establish some notation. Suppose there are N players and that player i ∈ {1, . . . , N} has a i &gt; 1 possible actions. Definition 1. A game is said to be finite if the number of players N and the number of actions a i available to each player i ∈ {1, . . . , N} are all finite.</p><p>So, we will use the term "robust finite game" to refer to robust games that have finitely many players with finitely many actions each, even when the uncertainty sets are not finite.</p><p>In the complete-information game setting, a multi-dimensional payoff matrix P, indexed over {1, . . . , N} × N i=1 {1, . . . , a i }, records the payoffs to the players under all possible action profiles for the players. In particular, for i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, (j 1 , . . . , j N ) ∈ N i=1 {1, . . . , a i }, let P i (j 1 ,...,j N ) denote the payoff to player i when player i ∈ {1, . . . , N} plays action j i ∈ {1, . . . , a i }. Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S a i =    x i ∈ R a i x i ≥ 0, a i j i =1 x i j i = 1    .</formula><p>That is, S a i is the set of mixed strategies over action space {1, . . . , a i }. Let us define π π π : U × N i=1 S a i → R N as the vector function mapping a payoff matrix and the mixed strategies of N players to a vector of expected payoffs to the N players. In particular, π i P; x 1 , . . . , x N will denote the expected payoff to player i when the payoff matrix is given by P and player i ∈ {1, . . . , N} plays mixed strategy x i ∈ S a i . That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">π i P; x 1 , . . . , x N = a 1 j 1 =1 • • • a i j i =1 • • • a N j N =1 P i (j 1 ,...,j N ) N i=1 x i j i .</formula><p>Now that we have established some notation, we can formulate the best response correspondence in our robust optimization model for games with incomplete payoff information. We will compare this correspondence with those in Nash's and Harsanyi's models for games with complete and incomplete information, respectively. In the remainder of the paper, we will use the following shorthands.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x -i x 1 , . . . , x i-1 , x i+1 , . . . , x N x -i , u i x 1 , . . . , x i-1 , u i , x i+1 , . . . , x N S N i=1 S a i (3) S -i N i =1 i =i S a i .</formula><p>Every model of a game attributes some objective to each player. A player's objective in turn determines the set of best responses to the other players' strategies.</p></div>

We chose the latter over the former for two reasons. First, the former model is not, while the latter model is, in the spirit of robust optimization, in which we seek to optimize a worst-case version of the nominal objective, i.e., the expected payoff. Second, while a robust approach is by its nature pessimistic, the former model is even more, and perhaps excessively, pessimistic. In it, each player assumes that the uncertain data realization will be maximally hostile with respect to the action outcomes of the randomizations yielded by all the players' mixed strategies. In contrast, in the robust model we propose, the maximal hostility is assumed by the players to be with respect to the mixed strategy probability distributions themselves; i.e., the "adversary" does not have the benefit of seeing the action outcomes of the randomizations, before he is forced to choose values of the uncertain data.</p><p>If one nonetheless opts, despite these drawbacks, to model each player as seeking to maximize his expected worst-case payoff, rather than his worst-case expected payoff, the game with incomplete information will be equivalent to one with complete information and with payoff matrix inf P∈U [ P].

This condition is quite strong. In fact, it is easy to prove the well-known result that every ex post equilibrium of an incompleteinformation game is an equilibrium of any corresponding Bayesian game arising from the assignment of a distribution over the set U . Similarly, we have the following lemma, establishing an analogous result for the set of robust-optimization equilibria.</p><p>Lemma 1. Any ex post equilibrium of an incomplete-information game, without private information, is a robust-optimization equilibrium of the game.</p><p>Proof.

Using one of these examples, in Section 3.6, we will demonstrate that, in general, ex post equilibria do not exist in incomplete-information games. Before giving these examples, we wish to address two questions that the reader may have regarding our approach. In Section 3.3, we will discuss why, in the context of distribution-free, incomplete-information games, it is reasonable, and in fact natural, to combine the notion of equilibrium with a worst-case viewpoint. In Section 3.4, we will discuss our motivation for considering mixed strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Why combine equilibrium and worst-case notions?</head><p>Recall that, with the exception of two-person, zero-sum games with complete information, mixed strategy equilibria do not generally consist of max-min strategies. That is, a player's strategy in a mixed-strategy equilibrium is not generally the one guaranteeing him the best possible expected payoff when his counterparts collude to minimize this quantity. The reason is that a player's counterparts generally have incentive to deviate from such collusive behavior, in order to try to individually maximize their own payoffs. In turn, the player himself therefore generally has incentive to deviate from the aforementioned max-min strategy.</p><p>In contrast, the robust optimization paradigm is fundamentally such a max-min, or a worst-case, approach. In our robust games model, given his counterparts' strategies, each player formulates a best response as the solution of a robust optimization problem. Based on the discussion in the preceding paragraph, one may worry that, by analogy, best responses based on robust optimization are not conducive to equilibrium. This analogy fails, and this worry is therefore unfounded, for the following reason. In our model, a player's counterparts are outside the scope of that player's pessimistic viewpoint. In particular, each player takes a worst-case view only of the uncertain parameters that define his payoff function, under a given tuple of his counterparts' strategies. Each player does not take a worst-case approach to his uncertainty with respect to this tuple itself, as is done in classical max-min strategies. Indeed, "nature," rather than any of the players themselves, selects these unknown payoff parameter values. Accordingly, in order for the analogy to hold, nature must be a participant, on the same footing as the other players, in the game. However, nature receives no payoff in the game, and therefore cannot be characterized as a player itself.</p><p>Thus, it is indeed reasonable to combine, as we have done, the notion of equilibrium with the robust optimization paradigm. Let us now explain why this union is in fact natural, in the context of incomplete-information games. If the players commonly know that they all take a robust optimization approach to the payoff uncertainty, then they would all commonly know each others' best response correspondences. Armed with this common knowledge, the players could then attempt to mutually predict each other's behavior, just as they could in a complete-information game, as discussed in Section 1.1. Recall from this discussion that the set of Nash equilibria are the set of consistent such mutual predictions in a finite, complete-information game. Analogously, the set of equilibria of a robust finite game are the set of consistent such mutual predictions in the corresponding finite, distribution-free, incomplete-information game. As such, our notion of equilibrium in a robust game offers a natural approach to attempting to predict the outcomes of such incomplete-information games.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Interpretation of mixed strategies</head><p>We will now explain our motivation for considering mixed strategies, and we will relate this discussion to interpretations of mixed strategies in the context of complete-information games (see, for example, Chapter 3 of Osborne and Rubinstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>). In the case of finite games with complete information, some game theorists support the literal interpretation of mixed strategies as actual randomizations by the players over their action spaces. Others are dissatisfied with this viewpoint. The latter group note the following property of mixed strategy equilibria, in finite, complete-information games. In response to his counterparts' behaviors in any such equilibrium, each player's mixed strategy does as well, but no better than the actions contained in its support. The opponents of the literal interpretation therefore argue that this lack of strict preference for randomization undermines the belief that players randomize in reality.</p><p>In the case of robust finite games, this argument against the literal interpretation does not hold. In particular, because of the infimum in the worst-case expected payoff function, this function is nonlinear. Consequently, for any mixed strategy equilibrium in such a game, in response to his counterparts' behavior in this equilibrium, each player will, in general, strictly prefer his mixed strategy over the actions in its support. Accordingly, one may argue that the literal viewpoint of mixed strategies is more justified in the context of robust games than it is in the context of complete-information games.</p><p>One may nonetheless remain dissatisfied with this belief that players randomize in real-world, game-theoretic settings, even those involving payoff uncertainty. Let us then consider an alternative interpretation of mixed strategies. In the literature on finite, complete-information games, some have advocated the viewpoint of mixed strategy equilibria as limiting, empirical frequencies of actions played, when the game is repeated.</p><p>The same empirical frequency interpretation extends to robust finite games. Imagine that the players engage concurrently in many instances of the same game, with the same, unknown payoff matrix P. Suppose the players know that P is constant across all instances, but are uncertain of its true value. As before, suppose each player knows only an uncertainty set to which P belongs, has no distributional information with respect to this set, and takes a worst-case approach to this uncertainty. Lastly, suppose that, in each instance of the game, each agent may play a different action. Each player thus builds, in essence, a "portfolio" of actions. The payoff from each action in the portfolio is determined by the other players' actions in the corresponding instance of the game and by the single unknown value of P. Accordingly, we may view the mixed strategy equilibria as the limiting, empirical frequencies describing each player's level of diversification within his portfolio of actions. Note that this portfolio interpretation can be recast in terms of sequentially repeated games, in which the players know that the uncertain payoff matrix is constant over all rounds, and in which they do not receive their payoffs until the final round is played. That is, the players do not know, until at least after play has terminated, the true value of P.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Examples of robust finite games</head><p>Having presented our robust games model and addressed some interpretation issues, we will now illustrate our approach with a few examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 1. Robust Inspection Game</head><p>Consider the classical inspection game discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The row player, the employee, can either shirk or work (actions 1 and 2, respectively). The column player, his employer, can either inspect or not inspect (actions 1 and 2, respectively). The purpose of inspecting is to learn whether the employee is working. The two players simultaneously select their actions. When the employee works, he suffers an opportunity cost g, and his employer enjoys a value of work output of ṽ. When the employer inspects, she suffers an opportunity cost of h. If she inspects and finds the employee shirking, she need not pay him his wage w. Otherwise, she must pay him w. In the nominal version of the game, ṽ, w, g, and h are commonly known with certainty by the players. In practice, it seems reasonable that the opportunity costs and the value of work output (e.g., subject to unpredictable defects) would be subject to uncertainty. To this end, suppose that ṽ, g, and h are subject to independent uncertainty, the nature of which is common knowledge between the two players. For example, we may consider the robust game in which the payoff uncertainty set is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">U = (0,-h) (w,-w) (w-g, ṽ-w-h) (w -g, ṽ -w) g, ṽ, h ∈ [g, g] × [v, v] × [h, h] .</formula></div>

Robust Free-Rider Problem</head><p>Consider the symmetric version of the classical, 2-player, free-rider problem discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Each player must make a binary decision of whether or not (actions 1 and 2, respectively) to contribute to the construction of a public good. The players make their decisions simultaneously. If a player contributes, the player incurs some cost c, which is subject to minor uncertainty (e.g., because projected costs are rarely accurate), in a way that is common knowledge to the two players. If the public good is built, each player enjoys a payoff of 1. The good will not be built unless at least one player contributes. So, we may consider the resulting robust game with payoff uncertainty set</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">U = (1 -c, 1 -c) (1 -c, 1) (1, 1 -c) (0, 0) c ∈ [ č -, č + ] ,</formula><p>for some fixed &gt; 0.</p></div>

Robust Network Routing</head><p>Network routing games, formulated as early as 1952 by Wardrop <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, have become an increasingly popular topic in the game theory literature. Within the last five years, Papadimitriou <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and others have studied the so-called "price of anarchy," or the ratio of total payoffs at equilibrium to those at Pareto optimality.</p><p>Consider a network routing game, in which N internet service providers must each contract for the use of a single "path" in a network of a paths (e.g., servers, wiring, etc.). The providers must make these arrangements simultaneously and prior to knowing the demand to be faced (i.e., the amount of data their customers will want to route). So, each provider's action space is the set of paths in the network. Suppose edge latencies in the network are linear and additive, and that the payoff to provider i when he uses path j i is given by the negative of total latency experienced on edge j i . That is, higher latencies yield lower payoffs. Specifically, we can express the uncertain payoff matrix P as a function, P, of the uncertain demands to be faced. Let di denote the uncertain demand to be faced by provider i. ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, ∀(j 1 , . . . , j N ) ∈ {1, . . . , a} N , let</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">P i (j 1 ,...,j N ) d1 , . . . , dN = - {i | j i =j i } λ (i ,j i ) di ,</formula><p>where λ (i,j i ) are nonnegative coefficients that account for the fact that the marginal latencies may differ by provider and path. The demand uncertainty may arise from the fact that the providers commonly know the total demand D to be faced by all of them, but do not know how this demand will be distributed among them (e.g., uncertainty of projected subscribership for a future year). For example, the uncertainty set may be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">U = P d1 , . . . , dN N i=1 di = D, di ≥ d i , i = 1, . . . , N ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">D &gt; N i=1 d i d i &gt; 0, i = 1, . . . , N,</formula><p>are commonly known by the players.</p></div>

Each possible realization of g, ṽ, h ∈</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">[g, g] × [v, v] × [h, h]</formula><p>gives rise to a nominal game, i.e., a game with complete information. It is easy to show that each such game has a unique equilibrium in which the employee shirks (action 1) with probability h/w and the employer inspects (action 1) with probability g/w. So, unless g = g and h = h, this incomplete-information game has no ex post equilibria. Accordingly, the ex post equilibrium concept cannot be applied to all games with incomplete information, because such equilibria need not exist. In contrast, in the next section, we will prove that any robust finite game with bounded uncertainty set has an equilibrium. In this way, robust games offer an alternative distribution-free notion of equilibrium, whose existence is guaranteed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Computing sample equilibria of robust finite games</head><p>In Section 4, we established the existence of robust-optimization equilibria in any finite, incomplete-information game with bounded uncertainty set and no private information. In this section, for any resulting robust game with bounded polyhedral uncertainty set, we show that the set of equilibria is a projection of the set of solutions to a system of multilinear equalities and inequalities. This projection is a simple component-wise one, into a space of lower dimension. Based on this formulation, we present an approximate computation method for finding a sample equilibrium of such a robust game. We provide numerical results from the application of our method. Finally, we describe a class of robust finite games whose set of equilibria are precisely the set of equilibria in a related complete-information, finite game in the same action spaces. As noted before, in this section, we focus on robust games not involving private information. In Section 7, we provide a more general result on the computation of robust-optimization equilibria in games with private information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Review for complete-information, finite games</head><p>Before describing our technique for finding robust-optimization equilibria, let us review the state of the art for complete-information, finite games.</p><p>Solving for an equilibrium of a general complete-information, finite game is regarded as a difficult task <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Two-person, zero-sum games are the exception. As noted in von Stengel <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, in any such game, the set of Nash equilibria is precisely the set of maximinimizers, as defined by von Neumann and Morgenstern <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Accordingly, the equilibria are pairs of solutions of two separate LPs, one for each player, and the set of equilibria is therefore convex. For non-fixed-sum games, solving for Nash equilibria is more computationally demanding, and the set of equilibria is generally nonconvex. As discussed in McKelvey and McLennan <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the set of Nash equilibria can be cast as the solution set of several well-known problems in the optimization literature: fixed point problems, nonlinear complementarity problems (linear in the case of two-player games), stationary point problems, systems of multilinear equalities and inequalities, and unconstrained penalty function minimization problems, in which a penalty is incurred for violations of the multilinear constraints.</p><p>Algorithms for finding sample Nash equilibria exploit special properties of these formulations. Traditionally, the favored algorithm for two-player, non-fixed-sum, finite games with complete information has been the Lemke-Howson path-following algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for linear complementarity problems. For this more general class of problems, the algorithm's worst-case runtime is exponential. The worst-case runtime in the specific application context of two-person games is unknown. For N -player complete-information, finite games with N &gt; 2, the traditionally favored algorithms have been different versions of path-following methods based on Scarf's simplicial subdivision approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> to computing fixed points of a continuous function on a compact set. These simplicial subdivision algorithms include that of van der Laan and Talman <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>, and their worst-case runtimes are also exponential. The Lemke-Howson and simplicial subdivision algorithms form the backbone of the well-known game theory software Gambit <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>More recent approaches to solving for sample Nash equilibria have exploited the multilinear system formulation, and have applied general root-finding methods to the complementarity conditions that arise from this system. For an overview of the formulation, we refer the reader to Chapter 6 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. For a comparison of these Gröbner basis and homotopy continuation methods of computation with the more traditional Gambit software, we refer the reader to Datta <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Govindan's and Wilson's <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> global Newton method similarly uses the multilinear system formulation. Finally, Porter, Nudelman, and Shoham <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> offer a potential shortcut, which exploits the fact that, for complete-information games, it is easier to solve for a Nash equilibrium with a fixed support, and that smaller supports yield lower runtimes.</p><p>These more recent numerical techniques are more powerful in terms of their aptitudes at computing all equilibria of a complete-information, finite game, a more difficult task than computing a single, sample equilibrium. For example, PHCpack <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> can find all isolated roots of a system of polynomials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2.">Computation method</head><p>For robust finite games with bounded polyhedral uncertainty sets and no private information, we showed in Section 5.2.1 that the set of equilibria is a projection of the solution set of a system of multilinear equalities and inequalities. This projection is a simple component-wise projection into a space of lower dimension. Currently available and computationally effective solvers for large polynomial systems tend to be specific to systems of equations and not inequalities. Accordingly, we propose to solve the multilinear systems for the robust-optimization equilibria by converting any such system into a corresponding penalty function, and then solving the resulting unconstrained minimization problem.

It is possible, though not guaranteed, that, when the system of constraints has more than one solution, multiple pseudo-Newton method runs may identify multiple, distinct approximate solutions of the system. Furthermore, in contrast to most other state-of-the-art polynomial system solvers, this method is capable of finding non-isolated, as well as isolated solutions.</p><p>In the next subsection, we present numerical results from the implementation of this technique for approximately computing a sample robust-optimization equilibrium.</p></div>

We executed all computations in MATLAB 6.5.0 R13, running on the Red Hat Linux 7.2-1 operating system, on a Dell with a Pentium IV processor, at 1.7 GHz with 512 MB RAM. To encourage the numerical method to find points satisfying the nonnegativity and normalization constraints on x i and θ θ θ i , i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, we multiplied the amount of violation of each such constraint by M = 100, before halving the square of this violation. We initialized all runs of the pseudo-Newton method by, for each i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, randomly generating x i and θ θ θ i , satisfying the aforementioned nonnegativity and normalization constraints. We initialized z i to be the maximum possible value satisfying the upper-bound constraint on z i , and we set φ i either equal to z i or to the minimum possible value allowed by the lower-bound constraint on φ i . For each pseudo-Newton method run, we terminated the run if the current and previous iterate were too close, if the norm of the direction was too small, if the penalty was already sufficiently small, or if the number of iterations already executed was too large.</p><p>We executed the method on the robust inspection game, described in Example 1 in Section 3.5, with g = 8, v= 16, h= 4, w= 15,</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">g = 12, v = 24, h = 6.</formula><p>The multilinear system for the equilibria of this robust game has 22 constraints in 10 variables, after elimination of some redundant variables.

We terminated each pseudo-Newton method run once the penalty function dipped below 10 -10 or the number of iterations reached 2000. We used M = 1, since the method did not seem to be attracted to strategy profiles outside of the simplex. Let x i 1 denote the probability with which player i ∈ {1, 2} contributes. As will follow from Theorem 4, this robust game has 3 equilibria x 1  1 , x 2 1 : (1,0), (0,1), and (1c, 1c) = (3/8, 3/8). We made 15 sequential runs of the pseudo-Newton method, each initialized at a randomly generated point. These 15 runs required 1.8458 minutes, with each run executing an average of 1,652.1 iterations in an average of 7.3827 seconds. Terminal points with penalty function less than 10 -10 included (0.0000, 0.9999), (0.9999, 0.0000), (0.3750, 0.3751), and (0.3751, 0.3750). This example demonstrates that the method is capable of finding multiple equilibria, and possibly all equilibria, of a robust game.</p><p>Lastly, we executed the method on several instances of the robust network routing game, described in Example 3 in Section 3.5. The instances differ in terms of their values of N, the number of players, and a, the number of paths available. The resulting versions of System (15) consist of 2N 2 + N(2a + 3) constraints in N 2 + N(2 + a) variables.</p><p>For all the instances, we used the same values for D and λ λ λ. In particular, we set D = 5 and λ (i,j i ) to be a realization of the uniform distribution on [0, 4]. The computational results for these robust network routing games are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. For each instance, we made only one run of the pseudo-Newton method, and terminated it after the lesser of 50 iterations or the minimum number of iterations required to produce an iterate with associated penalty less than 10 -5 .

We could obviously achieve better speed or accuracy by varying the cap on the number of iterations and the penalty threshold used to decide whether to terminate the pseudo-Newton method run. These numerical results demonstrate that a practical method, simple in nature and general in its applicability, exists for approximately solving, with considerable accuracy and speed, for sample equilibria of robust games of small size. Furthermore, with longer runtimes and lower accuracy, this method may be capable of finding solutions for robust finite games of larger size.</p></div>

Indeed, in moving from the average parameter values, as used in the nominal game, to the worst-case parameter values, as used in the robust game, the employee's opportunity cost of working increases, and the employer's cost of inspecting increases.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Symmetric robust games and symmetric equilibria</head><p>Let us turn our attention to symmetric games and their symmetric equilibria, which comprise an important topic in the game theory literature. We end this section by showing that symmetric equilibria are guaranteed to exist in symmetric, robust finite games, just as they are in symmetric, complete-information, finite games. Stated very generally, a symmetric game is one in which the players are indistinguishable with respect to the game's structure (action and strategy spaces, payoff functions, information, etc.). More formally, we have the following definition. Definition 6. A finite game with complete information is said to be symmetric if all players have the same action space, all players' payoff functions are invariant under permutations of the other players' actions, and all players' payoff functions are equivalent. That is, a complete-information game is symmetric if</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">a i = a, i = 1, . . . , N P i (j -i ,j i ) = P i (j σ σ σ (-i) ,j i ) , i,i = 1, . . . , N; ∀(j -i , j i ) ∈ {1, . . . , a} N ; ∀σ σ σ ∈ N-1 ,</formula><p>where (j -i , j) (j 1 , . . . , j i-1 , j, j i+1 , . . . , j N ) (j σ σ σ (-i) , j) (j σ (1) , . . . , j σ (i-1) , j, j σ (i+1) , . . . , j σ (N) ),</p><p>and N-1 denotes the set of permutations of N -1 elements. A tuple of players' strategies will be said to be symmetric if all players' strategies in the tuple are identical. In particular, a symmetric equilibrium refers to an equilibrium in which all players play the same strategy.</p><p>Similarly, this definition extends, as follows, to robust finite games. Definition 7. A robust finite game with uncertainty set U ⊆ R N N i=1 a i and no private information is said to be symmetric if</p><formula xml:id="formula_98">a i = a, i = 1, . . . , N ρ i x -i , x i = ρ i x σ σ σ (-i) , x i , i,i = 1, . . . , N; ∀ x -i , x i ∈ S; ∀σ σ σ ∈ N-1 ,</formula><p>where x σ σ σ (-i) , x i denotes x σ (1) , . . . , x σ (i-1) , x i , x σ (i+1) , . . . , x σ (N) .</p><p>Accordingly, for example, the robust game presented in Example 2 of Section 3.5 is symmetric.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, Nash proved the existence of symmetric equilibria in symmetric, finite games with complete information. We state and prove the following analogous existence result for robust games.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 5 (Existence of Symmetric Equilibria in Symmetric Robust Finite Games).</head><p>Any N-person, non-cooperative, simultaneous-move, one-shot, symmetric robust game, in which N &lt; ∞, in which each player i ∈ {1, . . . , N} has 1 &lt; a &lt; ∞ possible actions, in which the uncertainty set of payoff matrices U ⊆ R Na N is bounded, and in which there is no private information, has a symmetric equilibrium.</p><p>Proof. By the definition of symmetry of a robust game, there exists a function ρ : S → R such that ρ ≡ ρ i , ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N}. Now define : S → 2 S as (x) = y ∈ S a y ∈ arg max u∈S a ρ x -i , u , where x -i denotes the (N -1)-tuple (x, x, . . . , x). The N -tuple (x, x, . . . , x) ∈ S is a symmetric equilibrium of the robust game iff x is a fixed point of . From an argument paralleling that given in the proof of Theorem 2, it follows that satisfies Kakutani's Fixed Point Theorem.</p><p>Symmetric games with incomplete information may be of particular interest for two reasons. First, incomplete-information games, in which the players are indistinguishable with respect to the game structure, may be especially amenable to the common prior assumption in Harsanyi's model and to its analog, the assumption of a common uncertainty set, in our robust game model. Second, the multilinear system formulations for symmetric equilibria of symmetric, robust finite games are smaller, by a factor of N , than those for the general equilibria of these games. Indeed, in systems ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_61">16</ref>), if we replace x i , i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, by the single a × 1 vector variable x, subsequent elimination of redundancies then reduces the number of variables and constraints in these systems by a factor of N . Thus, we may be able to compute symmetric equilibria of symmetric, robust finite games more quickly and accurately, and with less computational effort, than we can compute the general equilibria of these games.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Extension of the model</head><p>As in the preceding sections of the paper, consider an N -person, incomplete-information game, in which player i ∈ {1, . . . , N} has a i &lt; ∞ possible actions, and in which each player is in some way uncertain of the multi-dimensional payoff matrix P that parameterizes the expected payoff vector function π π π . Suppose that each player may have private information about P or about the other players' beliefs. For each player i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, his potentially private information may be encoded in his "type" θ i . Since the information is potentially private, player i may be uncertain of the type θ i of player i , i = i. Let U denote, as before, a set of possible payoff matrices P. Let i denote the set of possible types of player i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, and = N i=1 i . In using separate notation for the unknown payoff parameters P and the players' types θ θ θ, we make explicit the difference between the actual payoff parameters and the Recall that, in Harsanyi's model, each player seeks to optimize his average performance, i.e., his average expected payoff, where the average is taken with respect to a probability distribution over V i (θ i ).

We use the notation b -i (•) to highlight the fact that b -i is a function. Since the best response correspondence completely determines the criterion for equilibrium, it follows that the tuple of behavioral strategies b 1 </p><formula xml:id="formula_100">π i P; b -i (θ θ θ -i ), u i θ i   , ∀θ i ∈ i .</formula><p>In contrast to Harsanyi, we assume that each player i ∈ {1, . . . , N} lacks distributional information over V and V i (θ i ) and therefore seeks to optimize his worst-case performance, i.e., his worst-case expected payoff, where the worst case is taken with respect to V i (θ i ). Therefore, in a robust game involving private information, the set of best responses by player i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, when he is of type θ i ∈ i , to b -i (•) is given by the set arg max Accordingly, the tuple of behavioral strategies b 1 (•), . . . , b N (•) ∈ B is an equilibrium of the robust game with private information, i.e., is a robust-optimization equilibrium of the corresponding game with incomplete information, iff, ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, b i (θ i ) ∈ arg max</p><formula xml:id="formula_101">u i ∈S a i   inf P,θ θ θ ∈V i (θ i ) π i P; b -i (θ θ θ -i ), u i   , ∀θ i ∈ i .</formula><p>Before turning to the issue of equilibria existence, let us revisit the relation of the ex post equilibria of an incomplete-information game to the corresponding robustoptimization equilibria, this time in the context involving potentially private information.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Existence of equilibria</head><p>We will now extend our existence result from Section 4, in which we considered robust finite games without private information, to general robust finite games. Let us start by considering such games in which all of the players' type spaces are finite, i.e., ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, i = {1, . . . , t i }, where t i &lt; ∞. Recall that player i's pure strategies are mappings from i to {1, . . . , a i }. Then, the set of player i's pure strategies is simply {1, . . . , a i } t i . Similarly, player i's behavioral strategies can be encoded as a i × t i matrices, where column ∈ i gives player i's randomization over his action space when he is of type θ i = . More precisely, Having treated the case in which all of the players' type spaces are finite, let us now consider the more general case in which there may exist an i ∈ {1, . . . , N} such that | i | = ∞. If player i has infinitely many types, his behavioral strategies B a i = b i : i → S a i cannot be encoded as finite matrices but are functions with infinite domains, and therefore belong to an infinite dimensional space. Kakutani's Fixed Point Theorem applies to correspondences defined over Euclidean spaces, which are, by definition, finite dimensional. Accordingly, we cannot use Kakutani's theorem to prove the existence of behavioral strategy equilibria in robust finite games in which at least one player's type space is infinite. Instead, we need a fixed point theorem that applies to Banach spaces. The following fixed point result of Bohnenblust and Karlin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> generalizes Kakutani's theorem to Banach spaces. Before stating it, we first recall a relevant definition. Definition 8 (as stated in Smart <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>). Let S and T be subsets of a normed space. is called a K-mapping of S into T if the following two conditions hold.</p><p>1. ∀s ∈ S, (s) ⊆ T , (s) = ∅, and (s) is compact and convex. 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>We make several contributions in this paper. We propose a novel, distribution-free model, based on robust optimization, of games with incomplete information, and we offer a corresponding distribution-free, robust-optimization equilibrium concept. We address incomplete-information games without private information as well as those involving potentially private information. Our robust optimization model of such games relaxes the assumptions of Harsanyi's Bayesian games model and simultaneously gives a notion of equilibrium that subsumes the ex post equilibrium concept. In addition, we prove the existence of equilibria in any such robust finite game, when the payoff uncertainty set is bounded. This existence result is in contrast to the fact that incomplete-information games need not have any ex post equilibria. For any robust finite game with bounded polyhedral payoff uncertainty set and finite type spaces, we formulate the set of equilibria as the dimension-reducing, component-wise projection of the solution set of a system of multilinear equations and inequalities. We suggest a computational method for approximately solving such systems and give numerical results of the implementation of this method. Furthermore, we describe a special class of robust finite games, whose equilibria are precisely those of a related complete-information game with the same number of players and the same action spaces. Using illustrative examples of robust games from this special class, we compare properties of robust finite games with those of their Bayesian-game counterparts. Moreover, we prove that symmetric equilibria exist in symmetric, robust finite games with bounded uncertainty sets.</p><p>We hope that these contributions will provide a new perspective on games with incomplete information.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>θ θ ∈V i (θ i ) π i P; b -i (θ θ θ -i ), u i   .</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Conversely, for an equally extreme example in which the set of equilibria of a robust finite game is larger than that of the corresponding nominal game, consider the robust game without private information and with payoff uncertainty set</p><p>Consider the nominal version of the game in which ( f1 , f2 ) = ( f1 , f2 ) = (4, 2) is commonly known with certainty by the players. This nominal game is now equivalent to the complete-information game of matching pennies and therefore has a unique equilibrium. In contrast, by Theorem 4, the robust game is equivalent to the complete-information game with payoff matrix</p><p>Thus, all pairs of mixed strategies for the two players are equilibria of the robust game. In moving from the robust game to its Bayesian counterpart, the set of equilibria expands, because the payoff uncertainty results in increased indifference, by each player, between his two actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Zero-sum becomes non-fixed-sum under uncertainty</head><p>In general, if we subject to uncertainty the payoff matrix in a zero-sum game, the resulting robust game will not be a fixed-sum game. For example, consider the payoff uncertainty set</p><p>In the nominal version of this game, the players commonly know with certainty that</p><p>In contrast, by Theorem 4, the robust game is equivalent to the complete-information game, with payoff matrix</p><p>which is not fixed-sum unless ff is constant for ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. This result is not surprising, since the two players' worst-case perspectives need not agree.</p><p>players' beliefs about these parameters and about the other players' convictions. In addition, this notation allows us to very clearly address the situation in which players may both possess private information and yet still be uncertain of the parameters affecting their own payoffs. In fact, the model we propose in this section is sufficiently flexible to simultaneously capture the case of no private information (the i are singletons, ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N}), the differential information setting involving all-but-self uncertainty (each θ i ∈ i is consistent with only a single Pi ), and the aforementioned differential information case in which agents may possess private information, while also being uncertain of both their own and others' payoff functions.</p><p>In the same spirit as does Harsanyi, we assume that the players commonly know a "prior" set V ⊆ U × of realizable tuples of payoff parameters and type vectors. While Harsanyi furthermore assumes, in terms of our notation, that the players commonly know a distribution over this set V , we assume that the players lack such distributional information or have chosen not to use it. Player i's type θ i induces the subset</p><p>That is, V i (θ i ) gives the set of tuples of payoff matrices and type vectors that player i, when he is of type θ i , believes are possible. As does Harsanyi, throughout the remainder of this section, we require that ∩ N i=1 V i (θ i ) = ∅, ∀θ θ θ ∈ such that {(P, θ θ θ) ∈ V } = ∅, and that the true payoff matrix P belongs to the projection of ∩ N i=1 V i (θ i ) onto U . The first requirement ensures that the players' beliefs are consistent, and implies that θ θ θ belongs to the projection of ∩ N i=1 V i (θ i ) onto , i.e., that the players believe that the true type vector is possible. The second requirement ensures that the players believe that the true payoff matrix is possible.</p><p>In the private information setting, for i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, player i's pure strategies are mappings from his type θ i to his action space {1, . . . , a i }. His so-called behavioral strategies (see, for example, Chapter 3 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for an introduction to behavioral strategies) are mappings from his type θ i to probability distributions over his action space {1, . . . , a i }. More formally, we denote a behavioral strategy for player i by b i : i → S a i . That is, under behavioral strategy b i , if player i is of type θ i , then he plays action j i ∈ {1, . . . , a i } with probability b i j i (θ i ). Let us define the notation</p><p>. i=1 a i is bounded. Suppose that, ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, player i's type space is given by i = {1, . . . , t i }, where t i &lt; ∞. Then the robust game has an equilibrium in B.</p><p>Proof. Let us define the point-to-set mapping : B → 2 B , where 2 B is the power set of B, as</p><p>It is obvious that X 1 , . . . , X N is a behavioral strategy equilibrium of the robust game iff it is a fixed point of . That satisfies the conditions of Kakutani's Fixed Point Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> follows from the facts that, ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N} and ∀θ i ∈ i , τ i θ i ; X -i , x i is continuous on B -i × S a i and is concave in x i over S a i for fixed X -i ∈ B -i . The details of the proof are analogous to those in our proof of Theorem 2, and we therefore omit them.</p><p>Proof. ∀ε &gt; 0, consider</p><p>where 1 &lt; M &lt; ∞ satisfies P i (j 1 ,...,j N ) ≤ M, ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, ∀(j 1 , . . . , j N ) ∈ N i=1 {1, . . . , a i }, ∀ P ∈ U.</p><p>The result follows from algebraic manipulation.</p><p>Lemma 7 immediately gives rise to the following continuity result.</p><p>Lemma 8. Let U ⊆ R N N i=1 a i be bounded. Then ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, ∀θ i ∈ i ,</p><p>In addition, it is trivial to prove the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 9. ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, ∀θ i ∈ i , and</p><p>We may now apply Bohnenblust's and Karlin's fixed point theorem to prove the existence of behavioral strategy equilibria in robust finite games with potentially infinite type spaces.</p><p>Theorem 8 (Existence of Equilibria in Robust Finite Games). Consider an N -person, non-cooperative, simultaneous-move, one-shot robust game, in which N &lt; ∞, in which player i ∈ {1, . . . , N} has 1 &lt; a i &lt; ∞ possible actions, in which player i's type space is given by i , and in which the prior uncertainty set of payoff matrices U ⊆ R N N i=1 a i is bounded. This robust game has an equilibrium in B.</p><p>Proof. We will proceed by constructing a point-to-set mapping that satisfies the conditions of Bohnenblust's and Karlin's fixed point theorem, and whose fixed points are precisely the behavioral strategy equilibria of the robust game with private information. Recall that, for a non-empty set i , the vector space of all bounded functions defined on i is a Banach space under the supremum norm (Theorem 3-2.4 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>). Furthermore, the direct product of finitely many Banach spaces is a Banach space (Theorem 2-4.6 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>). Accordingly,</p><p>is a Banach space. In the notation we used to state Bohnenblust's and Karlin's fixed point theorem, take M = M = B. B is a convex, closed, and compact subset of F .</p></div>			</div>
