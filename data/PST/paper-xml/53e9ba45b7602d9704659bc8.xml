<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper deals with the application of fuzzy logic in a relational database environment with the objective of capturing more meaning of the data. It is shown that with suitable interpretations for the fuzzy membership functions, a fuzzy relational data model can be used to represent ambiguities in data values as well as impreciseness in the association among them. Relational operators for fuzzy relations have been studied, and applicability of fuzzy logic in capturing integrity constraints has been investigated. By introducing a fuzzy resemblance measure EQUAL for comparing domain values, the definition of classical functional dependency has been generalized to fuzzy functional dependency (ffd). The implication problem of ffds has been examined and a set of sound and complete inference axioms has been proposed. Next, the problem of lossless join decomposition of fuzzy relations for a given set of fuzzy functional dependencies is investigated. It is proved that with a suitable restriction on EQUAL, the design theory of a classical relational database with functional dependencies can be extended to fuzzy relations satisfying fuzzy functional dependencies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since Codd <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr">171</ref> proposed the relational data model, relational database systems have been extensively studied and several commercial relational database systems are currently available <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45,</ref><ref type="bibr">461</ref>. This data model usually takes care of only well-defined and unambiguous data. However, in real world applications data are often partially known (incomplete) or imprecise. For example, instead of specifying that the height of John is 192 cm, one may say that the height of John is around 190 cm, or simply that John is tall. Such statements contain information about the height of John and may be useful in answering queries or making inferences based on age.</p><p>In order to capture more meaning of the data, several extensions of the classical relational model have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">291</ref>. In some of these extensions, a variety of "null values" have been introduced to model unknown or not-applicable data values. Attempts have also been made to generalize operators of relational algebra to manipulate such extended data models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">291</ref>. As an alternative approach, Rieter <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref> has suggested the usage of first order predicate calculus where Skolem functions are used to represent "null values." In the quest for capturing more meaning of the data, it would be natural to extend the classical relational model where partially known (as well as imprecise/fuzzy) data values, such as "salary of John is around $60,000" or "John has a high salary," are permitted. The fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic proposed by Zadeh [50-563 provide a requisite mathematical framework for dealing with such extended data values. Recently, some authors <ref type="bibr">[2, 3, 9-15, 25, 33-36, 42, 47, 48, 57</ref>, 581 have studied relational databases in the light of fuzzy set theory with an objective to accommodate a wider range of real-world requirements and to provide closer man-machine interactions. In some of these proposals, the classical relational algebra operations such as join, projection, etc., have been appropriately extended and the problems related to query language design and query evaluation have been examined.</p><p>As we extend the classical relational data model to deal with fuzzy information, it would be necessary to consider integrity constraints that may involve fuzzy concepts. In fact, fuzzy integrity constraints, such as "salaries of almost equally qualified employees should be more or less equal," will arise naturally in fuzzy databases. In classical relational database literature, integrity constraints and associated inference rules constitute a major area of research. Different types of integrity constraints, such as functional dependency, multivalued dependency, join dependency, etc., have been identified and sets of sound and complete inference rules for such dependencies have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref>. Several algorithms have been suggested to design normalized database schemes from a given set of data dependencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">461</ref>. It can also be ensured that the selected database scheme enjoys the lossless join property [l, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref>.</p><p>To deal with fuzzy data constraints, Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54]</ref> has introduced the concept of particularization (restriction) of a fuzzy relation due to a fuzzy proposition. Just as well-formed formulas of first order calculus can be used to represent integrity constraints in a classical relational database <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref>, fuzzy integrity constraints can be represented by suitable fuzzy propositions. Moreover, the particularization of a fuzzy relational database due to a set of fuzzy integrity constraints can be computed by combining the fuzzy propositions associated with these integrity constraints according to the rules of fuzzy calculus. In this paper we examine different types of fuzzy relations and particularizations of such relations due to fuzzy integrity constraints. Our primary objective is to extend the design theory of relational databases to the fuzzy domain by suitably defining the fuzzy functional dependency (ffd). A set of sound and complete inference rules for fuzzy functional dependencies is proposed and the lossless join problem of fuzzy relations is examined. In view of this, the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 of the paper deals with some of the basic definitions and concepts of classical relational database theory. In Sections 3 and 4 we introduce a few basic definitions from fuzzy set theory and discuss fuzzy relations and fuzzy integrity constraints. In Section 5, fuzzy functional dependency and associated inference rules are examined. Section 6 is concerned with the lossless join of fuzzy relations in the presence of fuzzy functional dependencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE CLASSICAL RELATIONAL MODEL</head><p>In this section some basic definitions and concepts related to the classical relational data model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">461</ref> are given.</p><p>Attributes are symbols taken from a finite set U = (Ai, Az, . . . , A,). Each attribute Ai has associated with it a domain denoted by dom(Ai), which is the set of possible values for that attribute. Elements of dam(A), dam(B), and dam(C) are usually denoted by a, b, c, respectively, with possible suffixes. For a set of attributes X, an X-value is an assignment of values to the attributes of X from their domain. We will use the letters A, B, . . . for single attributes and the letters x, Y, . . . for sets of attributes. The union of two sets X and Y is written as XY. Also no distinction is made between a single attribute and the set (Al.</p><p>A relation r with attributes (Al, AZ, . . . , A,) is a subset of the Cartesian product of dom(Al) x . . -X dom(A,). A relation scheme on (Al, . . . , A,) will be denoted by R(A1 . . . A,) or R. A relation r is considered to be an instance of a relation scheme R. The elements of the relation are called tuples or rows. A tuple is usually represented as a string of values associated with the attributes; for example, ac is a tuple of a relation r on R(AC). If t is a tuple in a relation r of R(U), and A is an attribute in U, then t[A] is the A-component of t. Similarly for the set of attributes X G U, we use the notation t[X] to denote the restriction of t to X; for example if t = abc, then t[AC] = ac.</p><p>There are two operations on relations that are of interest to us: projection and natural join. The projection of a relation r of R(XYZ) over the set of attributes X is obtained by taking the restriction of the tuples of r to the attributes in X and eliminating duplicate tuples in what remains. This operation is usually denoted by &amp;i(r) = (t[Xl It E r} <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref> Since in the fuzzy set literature the symbol II is used to denote the possibility distribution, in this paper we will use the notation Px(r) for the projection of r on X.</p><p>Let rl and r2 be two relations of R(XY) and R(XZ), respectively. The natural join rl w r2 is a relation over R(XYZ) defined by r = rl w r2 = (t ] t[XY] E rl and t[YZ] E r2] (2.2)</p><p>Among the different types of data dependencies that have been identified so far, the functional dependency requires special mention. In fact, the importance of the functional dependency in the design of relational database systems has been realized since Codd <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[ 16,</ref><ref type="bibr">171</ref> introduced the relational data model. Formally, a functional dependency (fd) is a statement, X + Y where X and Y are sets of attributes. A relation r satisfies this fd if for all t1 and tz in r, tIIX] = t2[X] implies tl[Y] = tz <ref type="bibr">[Y]</ref>.</p><p>The design theory of relational databases is also concerned with the problem of finding a set of relation schemes that have lossless join. In order to define lossless join, let p = (RI, RP, . . . , RkJ be a set of relation schemes with R(AlAz . . . A,) = R1R2 . . . Rk. The project-join mapping defined by p, written as mp, is a function of relations r over R defined by m,(r) = PR,(r) W P%(r) W . . . W Px,(r) <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref> The lossless join condition with respect to a set of dependencies D can be expressed as: for all r satisfying D, r = m,(r) (2.4) <ref type="bibr">Aho et al. [l]</ref> have proposed an algorithm to test lossless join decomposition in the presence of functional and multivalued dependencies. For this purpose a tableau T is constructed [l, 29, 30, 461, which is a set of rows, best pictured as a matrix with one column for each attribute in the set of attributes R and row i corresponds to the relation scheme Ri. The element of T on row i and column j is a distinguished variable aj if Aj is in Ri, otherwise the symbol bij is used. A set of transformation rules has been defined for different types of data dependencies that are used for changing a tableau T to a tableau T*. Such rules are essentially a means to incorporate information about the set of admissible instances into the tableau.</p><p>In the algorithm proposed by <ref type="bibr">Aho et al. [l]</ref> (to be referred to as the ABU algorithm), initially the tableau To associated with the given decomposition is constructed. The transformation rules corresponding to the data dependencies d E D are then repeatedly applied to TO to generate a sequence of tableaus To, T I, . . . , T, such that T. = T,,, and no transformation rule can be applied further. This process is called chase process and T, is denoted by CHASED. The join is lossless if CHASED(To) contains a row with all distinguished variables. The chase process has been applied to infer data dependencies. In fact, testing lossless join decomposition by this algorithm is equivalent to inferring the join dependency IN (RI, Rz, . . . , Rk) from D <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">FUZZY RELATIONAL DATA MODEL</head><p>In this section we first introduce a few definitions and concepts from the fuzzy set theory literature. We then examine how fuzzy relations can be used to represent imprecise data. For a detailed discussion of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy calculus the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr">[20, 26, 50-561.</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Fuzzy Set</head><p>Let U be a classical set of objects, called the universe of discourse. An element of U is denoted by u. In order to define Cartesian product of fuzzy sets, let U = U1 x UZ x . , . x U, be the Cartesian product of n universes and AI, AZ, . . . , A,, be fuzzy sets in U1, UZ, . . . , U,, respectively. The Cartesian product A1 X A2 X . . . A, is defined to be a fuzzy subset of U1 X Up x . . . X U, where The definition of fuzzy set in (3.1) has also been extended to define a category of fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. For instance, type-2 fuzzy sets are defined to be fuzzy sets whose grades of membership are themselves fuzzy, i.e., fiF in (3.1) is a mapping from U to the sets of fuzzy sets over [0, 11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Possibility Distribution and Fuzzy Sets</head><p>Instead of treating ,.&amp;F(u) to be the grade of membership of u in F, one may interpret it as a measure of the possibility that a variable X has a value u, where X takes values in U. As for example, consider the fuzzy set HIGH-SALARY given below.</p><p>HIGH-SALARY = (0.1/20,000, 0.3/30,000, 0.5/40,000, 0.7/50,000, 0.9/70,000, 0.95/80,000, 1.0/90,000) (3.10)</p><p>Suppose it is known that John has a "high salary." Then, according to the possibilistic interpretation, one concludes that the possibility of John having salary = 30,000, is 0.3. Zadeh [53, 541 has suggested that a fuzzy proposition X is F, where F is a fuzzy subset of U and X is a variable which takes values from U, induces a possibility distribution II, that is equal to F, i.e., II, = F (3.11)</p><p>The possibility assignment equation (3.11) is interpreted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Poss(X = u) = PE for all u E U (3.12)</formula><p>Thus the possibility distribution of X is a fuzzy set, which serves to define the possibility that X could have any specified value u in U. One may also define a function ?T~: U + [0, l] that is equal to PF and associates with each u E U the possibility that X could take u as its value, i.e., ?rx(u) = Poss(X = u) for u E U (3.13)</p><p>The function 7rx is called the possibility distribution function of X.

In Section 4, we discuss the rules of fuzzy calculus that can be used to compute the possibility distribution of a compound fuzzy proposition from the possibility distributions of its constituent atomic fuzzy propositions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Fuzzy Relations</head><p>Mathematically, an n-ary fuzzy relation r is a fuzzy subset of the Cartesian product of some universes. Thus, given U1, Uz, . . . , U, of n universes, a fuzzy relation r is a fuzzy subset of U1 x Up X . -. x U, and is characterized by the n-variate membership function <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">541</ref> pr: u1 x uz x * --x u, * [O, l] ACM Transactions on Database Systems, Vol. 13, No. 2, June 1986. <ref type="bibr">(3.15)</ref> While applying this definition to relational databases, it is necessary to provide appropriate interpretation for the elements of Ui, i = 1, . . . , n and pr. For this purpose, we note that in a relational data model that can support imprecise information, it is necessary to accommodate two types of impreciseness-namely, the impreciseness in data values and impreciseness in the association among data values. As an example of impreciseness in data values, consider the Employee(Name, Salary) database, where Salary of an employee, say John, may be known to the extent that it lies in the range $60,000-80,000, or may be known as John has a "high salary." Similarly, as an example of impreciseness in the association among data values, let Likes(Student, Course) represent how much a student likes a particular course. Here the data values may be precisely known, but the degree to which a student, say John, likes DBMS is imprecise. It is also not difficult to envisage examples where both ambiguity in data values as well as impreciseness in the association among them are present.</p><p>In recent years, there have been some attempts to use fuzzy set theory and related concepts for providing a suitable interpretation of different types of impreciseness in relational databases. Buckles and Petry [9-131 have suggested that attribute values be replaced by sets of values. A fuzzy similarity measure has also been used to identify similar tuples. Ruspini <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref> has used a lattice organization for domains, where domain values correspond to one or more lattice points determined by a possibility distribution. Umano [47, 481 and Prade and Testemale <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> have proposed models based explicitly on possibility distributions where domain values are taken from sets of possibility distributions and associations among entities are also measured by possibility distributions. Prade <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> and Prade and Testemale <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> have shown that such an extended data model can accommodate different types of "null values" used in classical relational database literature. Baldwin <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> has used a mixed approach, where domain values are allowed to be fuzzy sets and association among entities is represented as a truth value in [0, 11. Zemankova-Leech and Kandel <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref> have provided a good exposition of the fuzzy relational data model and have advocated the use of linguistic quantifiers.</p><p>In the present treatment of the fuzzy relational data model, we will try to adhere to the notations used in classical relational database theory as far as possible. Thus a relation scheme R is a finite set of attribute names (Al, AP, . . . , A,) and will be denoted by R(AIAz . . . A,) or simply by R. Corresponding to each attribute name Ai, 1 5 i I n, is a set dom(Ai), called the domain of Ai. However, unlike classical relations, in the fuzzy relational model, dom(Ai) may be a fuzzy set or even a set of fuzzy sets. Hence, along with each attribute Ai, we associate a set Ui, called the universe of discourse for the domain values of Ai. Definition 3.2. A fuzzy relation r on a relation scheme R(AIAz . . . A,) is a fuzzy subset of dom(Ai) x dom(Az) X . . -X dom(A,).</p><p>Depending on the complexity of dom(Ai), i = 1, . . . , n, we classify fuzzy relations into two categories. In type-l, fuzzy relations, dom(Ai) can only be a fuzzy set (or a classical set). A type-l fuzzy relation may be considered as a firstlevel extension of classical relations, where we will be able to capture the impreciseness in the association among entities. The type-2 fuzzy relations provide further generalization by allowing dom(Ai) to be even a set of fuzzy sets (or possibility distributions). By enlarging dom(Ai), type-2 relations enable us to represent a wider type of impreciseness in data values. Such relations can be considered as a second-level generalization of classical relations.</p><p>Finally, like classical relations, a fuzzy relation r will be represented as a table with an additional column for p,(t) denoting the membership value of the tuple t in r. Moreover, this table will contain only those tuples for which pr(t) &gt; 0, i.e., for any tuple not present in the table we assume pr(t) = 0. This observation can be considered as a fuzzy version of the closed world assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>. Since the law of excluded middle (3.6) does not hold for fuzzy sets, if pi(t) &gt; 0, where ? is the complement of r, we cannot conclude p*(t) = 0. Only when pi(t) = 1, i.e., t is definitely in r, do we have rr(t) = 0.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, pCL,(t) can be interpreted as a possibility measure of a student liking a particular course. Thus the possibility of John liking DBMS is 0.90. So I.C, is a fuzzy measure of the association between Student and Course.</p><p>It is also possible to provide an alternative interpretation of pcL, as a fuzzy truth value belonging to [0, 11. According to this interpretation, for a tuple t, pr(t) is the truth value of a fuzzy predicate associated with r when the variables in the predicate are replaced by t[Ai], i = 1, . . . , n.</p><p>Example 3.2. Consider a relation scheme R (N, H, X, S) of highly experienced and highly salaried employees, where N = Employee's name, J = Job, X = Experience, and S = Salary. Here, dam(N) and dam(J) are ordinary sets. But dam(X) and dam(S) are the fuzzy sets High-Experience and High-Salary in appropriate universes. Suppose that the universe of discourse Ux for the Experience is the set of positive integers in the range O-30. Similarly, Us, the universe of discourse for Salary, is the set of integer numbers in the range lO,OOO-100,000. The membership function ,.&amp;HX and Pns of the fuzzy sets High-Experience and High-Salary are as given below.</p><p>,&amp;X(x) = (1 + 1 x -10 1/4)-l for x 5 10 1 /.t~s(s) 1 (1 + ] s -60,000 ] /20,000)-1 for x &gt; 10 (3.17) for s 5 60,000 = 1 for s &gt; 60,000</p><p>Note that the membership function associated with the fuzzy set descriptor high is domain dependent. A typical instance r of R is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>.</p><p>In this example, p*(t) can be interpreted as the truth value of the fuzzy proposition "Y has high experience and high salary" for the tuple t. Thus the truth value of the fuzzy proposition "John has high experience and high salary" is 0.67.</p><p>In many applications, it may be necessary to combine both these interpretations of the membership function. For instance, in an entity relationship (E-R) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[ 19,</ref><ref type="bibr">461</ref>, one may interpret CL~ as the possibility of association among the entities and follow truth value interpretation for membership of a tuple in the entity sets. In this connection, a recent paper by Zvieli and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref> may be referred to, where fuzzy set theory has been applied to extend the E-R model and basic operations of fuzzy E-R algebra have been examined. An alternative interpretation of the membership function is also useful in supporting views of the data from several perspectives. Type-2 fuzzy relational data model. Although type-l relations enable us to represent impreciseness in the association among data values, its role in capturing uncertainty in data values is rather limited. For example, in a type-l relational model for Employee(Name, Salary), one is not permitted to specify salary of John to be in the range $40,000-$50,000 and that of Mary to be a fuzzy set "low." With a view to accommodating a wider class of data ambiguities, we next consider a further generalization of the fuzzy relational data model where for any attribute Ai, dom(Ai) may be a set of fuzzy sets in Us. AS a consequence of this generalization, a tuple t = (ala2 . . . a,) in D = dom(A1) X dom(Az) X . -. X dom(A,) becomes a fuzzy subset of U = U1 X UB X . . . X U, with PLt(U1U2 . . . u,) = min[k,h), k,(u2), . . . , ccanhAl <ref type="bibr">(3.19)</ref> where ui E Ui, for i = 1, . . . As in the case of type-l relations, II, may be interpreted either as a possibility measure of association among the data values or as a truth value of a fuzzy predicate associated with r. Regarding the interpretation of a fuzzy data value ai E dom(Ai), we can treat ai as a possibility distribution on Ui. In other words, for a tuple t = (ala2 . . . a,) E D, the possibility of t[Ai] = ui is equal to pai( For example, suppose that an instance of the relation Employee(Name, Salary) contains a tuple (John, S), where S = {0.3/10,000, 0.6/20,000, 0.8/30,000). Here S represents the possibility distribution for the salary of John, i.e., Poss(Salary of John = 20,000) = 0.6.</p><p>Based on the possibilistic interpretation, for a tuple t of r, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Poss(t[Al] = ul, t[Az] = u2, . . . , t[A,,] = u,) = mid&amp;), P&amp;U~ . . . u,)l (3.22)</formula><p>where ui E Ui, i = 1, . . . , n and pt is given by <ref type="bibr">(3.19)</ref>. It is also possible to extend  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>, where fuzzy set descriptors High, Low, Moderate, etc., have been used to represent fuzzy data values over respective domains.

Applying <ref type="bibr">(3.22)</ref> to the second tuple in r, we can conclude that the possibility of Roy having Experience = 18, Salary = 50,000, and Income tax = 5,000 is 0.67. The possibility value thus obtained would be useful during query evaluation for identifying the tuples that have nonzero (or greater than a given threshold) possibility of satisfying the query predicate.</p><p>The type-2 relational model described here has some similarities with the fuzzy relational models considered by Buckles and Petry <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Baldwin <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Prade and Testemale <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, and Umano <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">FUZZY INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS</head><p>The integrity constraints in relational database systems can be broadly classified into two groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref>:</p><p>(1) Domain dependency-which restricts admissible domain values of the attributes, e.g., "age of an employee is less than 65 years," or "no one is 10 feet tall." (2) Data dependency-which requires that if some tuples in the database fulfill certain equalities, then either some other tuples must also exist in the database, or some values of the given tuples must be equal.</p><p>Among these two types of dependencies, data dependencies have received wider attention as they have greater impact on the design of the database systems. Several types of data dependencies, such as functional dependency, multivalued dependency, join dependency, etc., have been identified and the associated implication problem has been examined [l, <ref type="bibr">4-6, 19, 21, 22, 24, 29, 30, 43, 461</ref>. The implication problem of data dependencies is the problem of deciding whether a given set of dependencies logically implies another dependency and has important bearing on the automated synthesis of database schemes.</p><p>As we generalize relational database systems to deal with fuzzy or incomplete information, it will be necessary to consider integrity constraints that involve fuzzy constructs. Thus in a relation PLAYERS(Name, Age, Height, Sport, Income), an integrity constraint may be stated as, "Most basketball players are tall," or "Many tennis players have high income." These integrity constraints impose restrictions on the admissible values of height or income of the basketball or tennis players, respectively. Similarly, as an example of a fuzzy data dependency, consider the relation scheme EMPLOYEE(Name, Department, Job, Experience, Salary), where an integrity constraint may be stated as "in any department employees having similar jobs and experience must have almost equal salary."    T2. Composition Rules. These rules can be used to find the possibility distribution associated with a compound proposition of the type X is F 0 Y is G, where the composition operator 0 may correspond to "and," "or," etc. The possibility distribution II(X 0 Y) associated with such a compound proposition is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">II(X 0 Y) = F 0 G (4.8)</formula><p>where F 0 G is a fuzzy subset of U X V.

This rule is based on the definition of implication in Lukasiewicz's multivalued logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>. However, Fukami et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> have pointed out that the consequences inferred by the compositional rule of inference often do not fit our intuition and do not even satisfy quite natural criteria such as modus ponens, modus tollens, or syllogism. In fuzzy logic, alternative translation rules for conditional fuzzy propositions have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>. These translation rules are usually based on different implication rules of multivalued logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>. Mizumoto and Zimmerman <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> have compared the translation rules for conditional fuzzy proposition and have shown that the translation rule based on the implication in standard sequence logic (called R,), or the Godelian implication rule (called R,) satisfy modus ponens, modus tollens, and syllogism. But even these translation rules may fail to satisfy some generalizations of modus ponens or modus tollens.</p><p>In this paper, we will use the translation rule R8 defined below to determine the possibility distribution associated with a conditional fuzzy proposition. Note PR, defines a hard partition of U X V, i.e., R, is an ordinary subset of u x v.</p><p>Besides the translation rules discussed above, Zadeh [53-551 has also proposed translation rules for quantified fuzzy propositions, such as QX is F, where the quantifier Q may represent "most," "many," "some," "few," etc. Similarly, the translation rules to determine the possibility distribution of a qualified fuzzy proposition X is F is T have also been suggested. The qualifier 7 may involve truth qualification, such as "true" or "very true," or a possibility/probability qualification.</p><p>In a relational database system, if the integrity constraints involve compound fuzzy propositions, the translation rules discussed above can be applied to determine the possibility distribution induced by such integrity constraints. We may then apply (4.2) to accommodate the effects of these restrictions on any fuzzy relation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">FUZZY FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY AND INFERENCE RULES</head><p>Our next objective is to extend the design theory of relational database systems to the fuzzy domain. In this quest, it is necessary to study fuzzy data dependencies and their associated implication problem. In this paper, we concentrate on the extension of functional dependencies as they constitute the most important class among the different data dependencies that have been identified so far and it is easier to identify such dependencies from design specifications.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 2, an instance r of a relation scheme R(A1A2 . . . A,) satisfies a functional dependency f: X + Y if, for each pair of tuples t1 and tz of r such that tl[X] = tz[X], we have tl[Y] = t2[Y]. In the fuzzy domain, equality of domain values defines a fuzzy proposition and may even be specified as "approximately equal, " "more or less equal," etc. For instance, a fuzzy data dependency in the relation EMPLOYEE(Name, Job, Experience, Salary) can be stated as "Job and Experience more or less determines Salary."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Equality as a Fuzzy Relation</head><p>The fuzzy relation EQUAL(EQ) defined below can be used as a fuzzy measure to compare elements of a given domain. Remark. It may be noted that unlike the classical equality, EQUAL is not assumed to be transitive, i.e., EQUAL need not be a similarity relation <ref type="bibr">[20, 261.</ref> This has been done with the objective of capturing integrity constraints arising out of approximate equality of domain values. In fact, with most distance/ proximity measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>  It can be readily checked that the membership functions defined above are reflexive and symmetric, as demanded by (5.1). Also, over dam(A), A E (X, S, I), the fuzzy resemblance relation EQUAL can be used to provide interpretation of approximate equality of the domain values. In Example 5.2, we will see how these fuzzy resemblance relations can be used to represent a fuzzy data dependency "for any job, experience determines salary."</p><p>Once the meaning of equality of domain values is finalized, the modifier rule of fuzzy calculus can be applied to provide interpretation for fuzzy relations "more or less equal" or "very much equal." For instance, the membership function of the fuzzy relation "more or less equal" would be given by where fc is the modifier function associated with c and a, b E dam(A). In order that aEQUAL be reflexive, we require f&amp;) = 1. The symmetry of aEQUAL follows from that of EQUAL. This modified membership function can now be applied to determine the possibility of, say, two salaries to be more or less equal. Finally, it may be mentioned that although the idea of treating equality as a fuzzy relation is motivated by our attempt to generalize integrity constraints, a similar approach can be followed in query processing. For example, a database query may be specified as "Get the name of employees who have more or less equal salary as their manager." In this case, "equal" should be treated as a fuzzy resemblance relation, and "more or less" as a modifier of "equal." Also, the fuzzy relation "equal" during query processing may be described by a different membership function than the one used for cornpairing domain values in fuzzy data dependencies. The evaluation of this query will retrieve the names of employees who have nonzero (or above a certain threshold value) possibility of having salary "more or less equal" to the salary of their manager. The possibility value of the tuple to be selected will be determined by the membership function of the fuzzy relation "more or less equal." In a subsequent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>, we will deal with the extension of QUEL <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref> and associated query evaluation procedures to support this type of query on a fuzzy relational database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Fuzzy Functional Dependency</head><p>Let X = Ai, Ai, . . . Ai, and Y = Aj, Aj, . . . AjP be subsets of a relation scheme R(AlAz . . . A,). Based on our interpretation of "equality," a fuzzy proposition X is equal defines a fuzzy subset of dom(Ai,) X dom(Ai,) X . . . dom(Ai,) with the membership function determined by (5.2). A generalization of an fd: X + Y in R, called ffd: X -Y, can now be defined as a particularization of a fuzzy relation on R due to a fuzzy conditional proposition If X is equal then Y is equal. The particularization imposed by an ffd is, therefore, linked with the translation rule used for conditional fuzzy propositions. In the following development we use the translation rule given in Definition 4.1.</p><p>With a fuzzy proposition If X is equal then Y is equal, the possibility distribution determined by (4.12) produces a hard partition of dom(A1) X dom(AP) X . -. x dom(A,). Combining this observation with the concept of particularization, we arrive at the following definition of a fuzzy functional dependency. (5.7) .</p><p>Remark. An fd in a classical relational database can be viewed as a special case of an ffd. To prove this, consider the ffd: X +, Y and suppose that the resemblance relation EQUAL over dam(A), A E XY, satisfies the additional property that pEQ(a, b) = 0 for a # b, a, b E dam(A). Since for a classical relational database r, pL,(t) = 1 for t E r, Definition 5.2 implies that no two tuples of r can agree in X-values, yet disagree in their Y values. However, insertion of this tuple would not violate a classical fd: JX + S. Thus the integrity constraint "for any job, experience determines salary" is not adequately represented by a classical fd when interpretation of this integrity constraint requires that "for any job, employees having approximately equal experience must have approximately equal salary." By suitably selecting pEQ, the ffd: JX w S provides a more acceptable model for such integrity constraints.</p><p>The proposed approach to generalization of functional dependencies also enables us to capture integrity constraints involving suitable fuzzy modifiers to "equal." Given a fuzzy modifier CJ with fO(l) = 1, we have seen that the modified relation aEQUAL is also reflexive and symmetric. With such modifiers, an integrity constraint defined by a fuzzy proposition If X is o1 equal then Y is c2 equal can be regarded as an ffd, where the modified membership functions of EQUAL should be used in (5.7), i.e., as  where the membership function of MLEQ is computed using (5.  The classical relation shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">IX</ref> is a typical instance of SUPPLY that satisfies <ref type="bibr">(5.8)</ref>. This ffd does not permit a tuple (102 bolt 14. 10. 86 29. 10. 86) to be inserted in the database because, along with the tuple (102 bolt 12. 10.86 18. 10. 86), already present in the database, such insertion will violate (5.10). The insertion of this tuple, however, does not violate a classical fd: Item Order-Date + Delivery-Date thereby implying that the fd has failed to capture the meaning of the given integrity constraint.</p><p>Finally, we would like to mention that the Definition 5.2 of a fuzzy functional dependency is not a unique way of generalizing classical fd in a fuzzy database. For instance, with an alternative translation rule for conditional fuzzy propositions, such as the one based on the Godeliun implication rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr">401</ref>, a different set of conditions is obtained. Secondly, Definition 5.2 requires that the validity of an ffd in a fuzzy relation have binary truth values. Thus a relation may either satisfy the ffd X -Y, or will contain tuples for which the condition (5.7) is violated. However, within the framework of fuzzy calculus it is possible to treat truth value of a fuzzy proposition to be a fuzzy subset of [0, l] [20, 53, 541. Hence, one can define a generalization of fds where the possibility of a fuzzy relation satisfying the given integrity constraint is even truth qualified. Some alternative generalizations of functional dependencies in a fuzzy database may be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[ 13,</ref><ref type="bibr">341</ref>. Different formulations of fuzzy functional dependencies will be examined in a subsequent paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Inference Axioms for Fuzzy Functional Dependency</head><p>Given a set of data dependencies that hold on a database, it is often possible to derive other data dependencies that also hold on the same database <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">461</ref>. In order to derive such new data dependencies from the given set of dependencies, a set of inference axioms is generally used. In the relational database literature, sound and complete sets of inference axioms for different types of data dependencies have been reported 119, 29, 461. We next present a set of sound and complete inference axioms for ffds, which is similar to Armstrong's Axioms for classical fds <ref type="bibr">[29, 461.</ref> Let us consider a relation scheme R(A1, Aa, . . . , A,) and a set of ffds F. An instance r of R is called a legal instance if r satisfies all ffds in F. As mentioned in the previous section, the validity of an ffd in a fuzzy relation r will be assumed to have binary truth value. In the following axioms, X, Y, and Z are subsets of the relation scheme R. The following inference axioms follow from above axioms. FF4. Union: If X zh+ Y and X -Z hold, then X -YZ holds. FF5. Decomposition: If X -YZ holds, then X -Y and X -Z hold. FF6. Pseudotransitivity:</p><p>If X -Y and YW -Z hold, then XW vy Z holds.</p><p>To prove the soundness of these axioms, consider an instance r of R and let t1 and tz be two tuples of r. with respect to the inference axioms, i.e., the set of all ffds that can be derived from F using the inference axioms. As a consequence of the similarity of the inference axioms for fds and ffds, the following lemma can be readily proved. This lemma suggests that we can apply the membership algorithms for fds (such as the one proposed by Beeri and Bernstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) to determine if an ffd f can be inferred from a given set of ffds using FFl-FF6. LEMMA 5.3. Let F be a set of ffds and fi = (V + W ) V -W E F]. Suppose by applying Armstrong's axioms to fi, the fd f: X + Y can be inferred. Then the ffd f: X zc* Y can be inferred from F by ffd axioms FFl-FF6.</p><p>PROOF. The lemma is proved by induction on the number of steps in the inference off 13.</p><p>Basis. If p E @, then by definition of #, f E F. Also Beeri and Bernstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have shown that in any derivation of p from p, the reflexivity axiom need not be used more than once. In fact, if Y G X, by reflexivity X + Y trivially follows from fi. But in this case, the reflexivity axiom of the ffd is also applicable and X +, Y would follow trivially from F. Induction. Suppose the claim is true for a derivation of p with k steps. That is if P logically implies f in k steps, then f can be inferred from F by ffd axioms. Consider an f: X + Y, which can be inferred from $' using (k + 1) applications of Armstrong's axioms. Following Beeri and Bernstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the reflexivity axiom will not be used since otherwise X + Y would have a derivation of length one.</p><p>Suppose iqthe (k + 1)th stepof the de+vation off, the augmentation axiomis used with fi: V + Z. Hence, F derives fi in k steps. Also, the derivation of f from fi using augmentation rule requires that X = VW and Y = ZW. By our assumption, the ffd fi: V * Z can be derived from F using ffd axioms. Now, augmenting both sides off by W, the ffd augmentation axiom produces X zc* Y. Next, suppose that the t:ansitivity axiom is used in the (k + 1)th step of derivation off. Then, there exists fi: X + V and f2: V += Y, such that both fl and fi can be derived from @ in less than or equal to k steps and p follows from these two fds by transitivity.</p><p>By our assumption, the ffds fi: X IVC* V and fi: V zlc, Y can be derived from F using ffd axioms. Also, the transitivity axiom can be applied to these two ffds to obtain X +-+ Y. Cl</p><p>We next examine the completeness of the ffd axioms. A set of inference axioms is said to be complete for a family of constraints, if for each set F from the family, the constraints that are implied by F are exactly those that can be derived from it using these inference axioms <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>. The following example shows that unlike Armstrong's axioms, the ffd inference axioms FFl-FF6 are not always complete. where pEQ(tl[A1A2], t2[A1A2]) is evaluated using (5.2).</p><p>(5.13)</p><p>We now show that r also satisfies Az -AS. To prove this, we note that when the proposition \k = ((tl So from (5.13) and (5.7), r satisfies Az -A3.</p><p>Therefore, for the present choice of EQUAL, the ffd A, A, -A3 implies A2 -A3 even though such an implication cannot be made using FFl-FF6. If we restrict EQUAL further by the condition that pso(ali, alj) = 1.0 for all ali, alj E dom(A,) (i.e., EQUAL does not distinguish the elements of dom(A1)), r will trivially satisfy the ffds AZ -A1 and A3 -A1. Again, none of these two ffds can be inferred from AlAP -A3 using FFl-FF6.</p><p>Example 5.4 indicates that, depending upon the type of the resemblance relations used for defining the ffds, it is possible to imply new ffds that cannot be inferred using FFl-FF6. To infer such ffds, we have to consider additional inference axioms that depend on the resemblance relations used for comparing the domain values. Since the number of resemblance relations that can be defined over any domain is infinite (not even countably infinite), a complete set of inference axioms can be obtained only for suitable class of ffds where additional restrictions are imposed on EQUAL. In this connection, it will be useful to find a class of ffds for which the inference axioms FFl-FF6 constitute a complete set. The following theorem establishes completeness of these ffd axioms when each domain has at least two elements that do not resemble each other. THEOREM 5.1. The inference axioms FFl, FF2, and FF3 form a complete set of inference axioms for fuzzy functional dependencies of a relation scheme R(AlAz . . . A,) when the following condition holds:</p><p>For each Ai E R, there exists at least one pair of elements ai, bi E dom(Ai) such that pEQ(ai, bi) = 0.</p><p>(5.14) PROOF. Given a set F of ffds over R. Suppose that the ffd f: W -V, with W, V C R, cannot be inferred from Fusing the inference axioms.</p><p>Let r be a fuzzy relation with two tuples t and tl shown below. t = (a,, az, . . . , a,,), and the tuple tl is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">tl[Ai] = ai if Ai E W+ = bi otherwise</formula><p>where pxo(aj, bj) = 0, for aj, bj E dom(Aj), j = 1, . . . , n. From our assumption, such aj and bj exist in each attribute domain.</p><p>First we show that r satisfies all the ffds in F. Let X -Y be an ffd in F. If X $Z W+, then for Aj E (X -W'), PEQ(t[Ajt h[Ajl) = PEQ(aj, bj) = 0. SO from (5. Since f cannot be inferred from F using the inference axioms, we now show that r does not satisfy f. From the definition of r, t[W] = tl [WI. In order that r satisfies f, we must have rxQ(t[V], tl[V]) = 1. But this requires V C W+, thereby implying that f follows from F by the inference axioms. Since this conclusion violates our original assumption, the fuzzy relation r cannot satisfy the ffd: W zh, V. Hence the inference rules are complete. Cl</p><p>The condition (5.14) defines a class of ffds for which the inference axioms FFl-FF3 constitute a complete set. In view of the similarity of the inference axioms, we would be able to apply many of the algorithms reported in the functional dependency literature to this class of ffds. For example, Beeri and Bernstein's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> can be applied to find a minimal cover of a set of such ffds. Since in most real-world applications it is not difficult to select suitable resemblance relations that satisfy (5. The resulting ffd still captures the semantics of the integrity constraint "for any item, Order-Date more or less determines Delivery-Date" for any two orders placed within 30 days.</p><p>Since (5.14) is only a sufficient condition for the ffd axioms FFl-FF6 to be complete, it may, however, be worthwhile to find a restriction on EQUAL that is both necessary and sufficient for the completeness of these axioms,</p></div>

The problem of lossless join of relation schemes is of central importance in the design theory of relational databases.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Fuzzy Functional Dependency and Lossless Join Decomposition</head><p>In classical relational database theory, it is well known that if an fd: X + Y holds in a relational database R(XYZ), then the decomposition p = (XY, YZ) of R is lossless. This important property of fds forms the basis of Codd's normalization procedures and can be shown to follow from the necessary and sufficient condition for lossless join of a two-component decomposition obtained by Rissanen <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>. It can also be proved by ABU algorithm using fd transformation rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref>. We now show that unless the fuzzy resemblance relation EQUAL is appropriately restricted, a similar property does not hold for ffds. Example 6.3. Consider a relation scheme R(ABC) with an ffd A YY B. Also suppose that the membership functions of the fuzzy resemblance relation EQUAL used for defining this ffd do not distinguish the elements of the domains of the attributes A and B, i.e., p&amp;a, al) = 1 and p&amp;b, bl) = 1, for all a, al E dam(A) and b, bl E dam(B). Note, pso thus defined obviously satisfies (5.1). An instance r of R that satisfies this ffd is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">XII</ref>.</p><p>Let R1(AB) and Rz(AC) be the decompositions of R. The projections rl and r2 over R1 and R2 are shown in Table XIII(a and b).</p><p>Let i = rl w r2. Then it can be checked that p;(abc) = &amp;ablcl) = 0.9, whereas pLr(abc) = 0.8 and p,(ablcl) = 0.6. In fact, i &gt; r, implying thereby that the decomposition of R based on the ffd: A ++ B is not lossless.</p><p>It can further be shown that whenever the resemblance relation EQUAL over dam(B) has hso(b, bl) = 1 for any b # bl, one can find an instance r of R that satisfies the ffd: A oh, B, yet the join of the projections of r over R1 and R2 is not equal to r.</p><p>Even though the assumption that EQUAL is a resemblance relation is sufficient for generalization of fds and associated inference axioms, this example suggests that for lossless synthesis of fuzzy relations with ffds, EQUAL needs to be Hereinafter, the class of ffds, where EQUAL is restricted by (5.la) will be referred to as restricted fuzzy functional dependency (rffd).</p><p>Note that if a fuzzy relation r satisfies an rffd: A zly B, then r cannot have two tuples which agree on A but disagree on B, just as in the case of classical fds. However, unlike classical fds, this rffd does not permit r to have two tuples ti and tz with tl</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">[A] # &amp;[A], if</formula><p>Thus whenever an rffd f: X -Y holds in a fuzzy relation r, the fd 3: X --* Y also holds in the same relation, although the converse is not true. The restriction imposed by (5.la), therefore, makes an rffd a stronger integrity constraint than a classical fd. However, even with this additional restriction on EQUAL, the ffds are still useful in modeling integrity constraints arising out of approximate equality of domain values. For instance, the resemblance relations used for modeling the integrity constraint, "for any Item, Order-Date more or less determines the Delivery-Date" in Example 5.3, satisfy (5.la). But some of the resemblance relations in Examples (5.1) and (5.2) do not satisfy (5.la). For the relation R(N, D, J, X, S, I), in Example 5.2, to have lossless join decomposition p = (NDJ, JXS, SI), we should select new resemblance relations over dam(X), dam(S), and dam(I), that satisfy (5.la).</p><p>The following theorem shows that under this additional restriction, the rffd: X w Y will lead to lossless join decomposition of R(XYZ). THEOREM 6.1. Given a relation scheme R(A1A2 . . . A,) with an rffd: X -Y, where X, Y C R. The relation scheme R bus a lassless join decomposition into two components Ri(XY) and R2(XZ), where Z = R -XY.</p><p>PROOF. Let r be a legal instance of R and rl and r2 be the projections of R over R1 and R2, respectively. We denote the cylindrical extension of ri(i = 1, 2) on R by i, and the natural join of rl and r2 by i.</p><p>In order that the given decomposition of R has lossless join, the condition (6.2) requires that for any t E D = dom(A1) X dom(A2) X . . . x dom(A,), there exists at least one ri, i E (1, 21, such that pr(t) = pi(t).</p><p>With a tuple t of r, i.e., pL,(t) &gt; 0, by (3.25 tl [Xl) = 1. Hence the condition (5.7) for the rffd: X +-. Y is violated. Thus, for all tuples t of r, we have a(t) = fli,(t), i.e., h(t) = r&amp;h</p><p>We now show that for a tuple t E D, which is definitely not in r, i.e., p,(t) = 0, either p,(t[XY]) = 0, or pLr2(t[XZ]) = 0, i.e., p;(t) = 0. We prove this result by contradiction. Suppose for a tuple t E D, pr(t) = 0, but both p,(t[XY]) # 0 and r,(t[XZl z 0. But by (5.2a), this would violate the rffd: X -Y. We have, therefore, established that for any t E D, pr(t) = p;(t), i.e., the join is lossless. Cl With classical fds, Rissanen <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref> has also established a converse of Theorem 6.1, according to which, if Ri(XY) and R2(XZ) is a lossless join decomposition of R(XYZ) with a set of fds F, then either X + Y, or X + Z, can be inferred from F using Armstrong's axioms. However, the following example shows that a similar result does not always hold with rffds.  This example suggests that the desired converse of Theorem 6.1 can hold only for a class of rffds where additional restrictions are imposed on EQUAL. In fact, when the resemblance relations of rffds are restricted further by <ref type="bibr">(5.14)</ref>, then by constructing a relation with two tuples (as in Theorem 5.1), it can be shown that a two-component decomposition has lossless join iff a condition similar to Rissanen <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref> holds.</p><p>We now examine whether the ABU algorithm can be applied to test lossless join decomposition of fuzzy relations with rffds.</p><p>Consider a relation scheme R with a set F of rffds and let p = (RI, R 2, . . . , R,] be a decomposition of R. Construct a set of fds P = (X + Y 1 X -Y E F). As discussed before, whenever a relation r satisfies the set of rffds F, it also satisfies the fds in i? Thus, we may say, the set of ffds F logically implies l?</p><p>We may now apply the ABU algorithm&gt;0 the decomposition p and let T,* = CHASEp(T,) be the chase of T, under F, where T, is the tableau associated with p [I, 29, 461. If p has a lossless join with respect to F, then as discussed in Section 2, T,* has a row (say ith row) which contains all distinguished variables [l, 29, 461. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref> that if the ith row of T,* consists of only distinguished variables, then the set of attribut:s Ri is a superkey of R(Ri + R). Thus the fd Ri + R can be inferred from F using Armstrong's axioms. By Lemma 3, we can then conclude that the rffd: Ri zly R can be inferred from F using ffd axioms. This observation enables us to prove the following theorem. where $' = (X + Y 1 X zc, Y E F) is the set of fds implied by F and T, is the tableau associated with p, has a row that contains only distinguished variables, then p has a lossless join.</p><p>PROOF. Suppose that ith row of CHASE$(T,) contains only distinguished variables. Then, as noted above, the rffd f: Ri w R can be inferred from Fusing ffd axioms. Consequently, any legal instance r of R that satisfies F, will also satisfy f, Let rj = P%(r). The cylindrical extension of rj on R is denoted by ?j. Now consider a tuple t in r. By (3.23) and (3.25), pFi(t) Z p,(t) if and only if there exists another tuple tl in r such that pr(tl) &gt; pL,(t) and t</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">[Ri] = tl[Ri], t[R -Ri] # tl[R -Ri].</formula><p>Since EQUAL relations used in defining rffds satisfy (5.la), with t and tl, pko(t[R -Ri], tl [R -Ri]) &lt; 1, whereas pko(t[Ri], tl [Ri]) = 1. Hence, the presence of both t and tl in r would violate the ffd Ri zc, R. Thus, for all tuples t of r, Pi(t) = tir@).</p><p>For a tuple t E D = dom(Al) x dom(An) x . . . x dom(A,), which is definitely not in r, i.e., p,.(t) = 0, we show that there exists a projection rj, j E (1, 2, . . . , s], of r such that GUI = 0.</p><p>To prove this result by contradiction, suppose ~;~(t) # 0 for all k E (L2, * * * , s). From (3.23) and (3.24), we may write Since pr(t) = 0, (6.4) implies that for &amp;t) # 0, r must contain at least another tuple tl with t[Ri] = t,[Ri], and t[R -Ri] # tl[R -Ri]. But in that case, i = rl W r2 W --. w rs will contain both the tuples t and t1 with nonzero membership values. Simultaneous presence of both t and tl in i would, however, violate the rffd: Ri +-+ R, contradicting the conclusion that natural join preserves ffds (see Lemma 5.2). Therefore, by (6.1), the decomposition p has a lossless join. 0 Theorem 6.2 suggests that to test lossless join of a decomposition p with a set of rffds F, we can use the chase process where the tableau transformation rule due to an rffd is the same as that due to an fd. Thus, suppose that in a tableau T, the rows w1 and w2 have identical entries in the columns corresponding to the attributes in X, i.e., w1 [X] = w2[X]. Then the transformation rule due to the rffd X * A, will produce a new tableau T1 where the entries in w1 and w2 at the column corresponding to A also match. While making w1 [A] = w2 [A], if either of them was a distinguished variable in T, then the other one is renamed to the same distinguished variable. In case both were nondistinguished, the one with a larger subscript is replaced by the one with the smaller subscript [l, <ref type="bibr">29, 30,</ref>   If required, the modified membership function of "more or less equal" (MLEQ) can be computed as in <ref type="bibr">(5.5)</ref>. It can be verified that /.lEo or /.LMLEQ defined as above satisfies (5.1) and (5.la). These resemblance relations are used in the following fuzzy functional dependencies F to be satisfied by ORDER: SI -Q: Supplier and Item determines Quantity.</p><p>IQ -P: For any Item, Quantity more or less determines Price.</p><p>P YC, T: Price determines Sales tax.</p><p>Since the resemblance relations satisfy (5.la), these ffds are actually restricted fuzzy functional dependencies. A typical instance of ORDER that satisfies these rffds is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">XIV</ref>   Let p = (R1 @IQ), R2(IQP), Rs(PT)] be a decomposition of ORDER. To test whether this decomposition is lossless, we construct the tableau Here the first row of CHASEF(T,) contains only distinguished variables. Therefore, by Theorem 6.2, the decomposition p is lossless join. The projections of F on p are shown in Table XV(a, b, and c). The join of these projections can easily be seen to be equal to F. In this case, the decomposition p also preserves the given dependencies, i.e., p can be considered as an information preserving decomposition [ 291.</p><p>Lastly, we would like to point out that Theorem 6.2 provides only a sufficient condition for the lossless join decomposition of fuzzy relations with rffds. Since the ffd axioms FFl-FF6 are not complete for all rffds, as in Example 6.4, a decomposition p of a fuzzy relation with a set F of rffds may have a lossless join even though T* = CHASEF(T,) has no row with all distinguished variables. However, when EQUAL also satisfies (5.14), i.e., the ffd axioms are complete for F (by Theorem 5.1), the absence of any row with all distinguished variables in T* can be shown to imply that p does not have a lossless join.</p><p>Based on these observations, it follows that all the results of the design theory of classical relations with functional dependencies can be directly applied to fuzzy relations with a class of fuzzy functional dependencies where EQUAL is restricted by (&amp;la) and (5.14). Since it is not difficult to select a resemblance relation that satisfies these two conditions, the ffds belonging to this class can adequately capture the semantics of fuzzy integrity constraints in many realworld applications. In addition, one can now define normal forms of fuzzy relations, or lossless join decomposition of relation schemes which also preserves the given ffds, i.e., an information preserving decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. l K. V. S. V. N. Raju and A. K. Majumdar ffds by imposing a simple restriction on the resemblance relations. This apparent similarity of the inference axioms is especially useful because many well-known algorithms in the classical fd literature, such as Beeri and Bernstein's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, can be applied to the ffds to perform similar tasks.</p><p>In order to obtain adequate decomposition of relation schemes, we next examined the lossless join problem of fuzzy relations in the presence of ffds. It is observed that to achieve lossless synthesis of relation schemes, the resemblance relation EQUAL needs to be restricted further. After introducing suitable restrictions on EQUAL, it is shown that a class of ffds behaves exactly the same as functional dependencies in classical relations. In fact, the entire design theory of classical relations with functional dependencies becomes applicable to fuzzy relations with this class of fuzzy functional dependencies. Thus one can apply the ABU algorithm to test lossless join decomposition of relation schemes with such ffds and can define an information-preserving decomposition or normal forms of fuzzy relations.</p><p>It should be mentioned that this work is not a complete nor a conclusive exposition of the capabilities of the fuzzy relations in capturing semantics of the data. However, within the proposed framework, it is not only possible to extend other types of data dependencies, such as multivalued dependency <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, template dependency <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, tuple or equality-generating dependency <ref type="bibr">[6, 24, 291, etc</ref>., but one can also model a wider class of integrity constraints. In this paper, we have restricted ourselves to a subclass of fuzzy calculus where truth value of a fuzzy proposition takes binary values. Further generalization of fuzzy integrity constraints can be achieved by using truth-qualified fuzzy propositions [20,53-M].</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Definition 3 . 1 .</head><label>31</label><figDesc>A fuzzy set F in a universe of discourse U is characterized by a for each u E U denotes the grade of membership of u in the fuzzy set F.Following the notations used in fuzzy set theory, we write I? = Mud/u~, ~(uz)/ua . . . , dun)/unl(3.2)    where ui E U, 1 5 i I n.

Here, we discuss projection and join of fuzzy relations as these operations are of primary importance in the study of the lossless join problem.Let the fuzzy relation r be an instance of a relation scheme R(A1A2 . . . A,). Consider a subset Ri(Ai, . . . Ai,) of R. AS in Section 2, for a tuple t of r (i.e., p*(t) &gt; 0), t[Ri] denotes the restriction of t on the attributes of Ri. Thus for t = (a1a2. . . a,), t[Ri] = (ai, . . . ai,).According to Zadeh<ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54]</ref>, the projection ri = P%(r) is a k-ary fuzzy relation in dom(Ai,) X . . . x dom(Ai,). Also the membership function pri is given by us = my Mt3 I tr[Rl = tl (3.23) where t, is a tuple of r and t E dom(Ai,) X . . . X dom(Ai,). Thus the tuples of rj are the restrictions of the tuples of r, as in the case of classical relations. The max operator in (3.23) ensures that if more than one tuple in r, say S, G r, has the same restriction t on Rip then the projection ri contains only one tuple and its membership value is the maximum of the grades of the tuples in S,. In the case of classical relations, since grades have binary values, (3.23) will only lead to duplicate removal. Umano [47, 481 has suggested an extension of (3.23) when p,(t) is treated as a possibility distribution in [0, 11. Example 3.4. The projection of the fuzzy relation r in Table II over RJs = {Job, Salary) is shown in Table IV. In the fuzzy set literature, projection is also called marginal fuzzy restriction [20, 531. As a converse operation, Zadeh [53, 541 has defined the cylindrical extension of a fuzzy relation. Let the fuzzy relation ri be an instance of a relation scheme R(Ai, . . . Ai,). Also consider a relation scheme R(AIAP . . . A,) where Ri C R. The cylindrical extension of ri on R is denoted by CR(ri). According to Zadeh [53, 541, the cylindrical extension ii = CR(ri), is an n-ary fuzzy relation in D = dom(Al) x dom(Az) x . . . x dom(A,).

According to Zadeh [53, 541, particularization may be viewed as the result of forming the conjunction of a fuzzy proposition X is F with the particularizing proposition Y is G where X = AlAz . . . A,, Y = Ai, . . . Ai, c X, F is a fuzzy subset of dom(A1) x dom(Az) x --x dom(A,), and G is a fuzzy subset of dom(Ai,) X *a* X dom(Ai,). The conjunction of these two fuzzy propositions is expressed in terms of the possibility distributions induced by them. As in Section 3.2, we associate possibility distributions IIx = F and Ily = G with the fuzzy propositions X is F and Y is G, respectively. The particularization of Rx by IIY (or equivalently F by G) is denoted by IIx[IIv = G] and is defined to be the intersection of F and G, i.e., I-Ix[IIy = G] = F n G (4.1) where 6 is the cylindrical extension of G in dom(Al) x dom(Az) x --. x dom(A,). Thus the particularization of a fuzzy relation r of R(AIAz . . . A,) due to a fuzzy proposition Y is G, where Y = Ai, . . . Aik, produces the relation r with membership function as given below. h&amp;la2 . . . a,) = minMa1a2 . . . aA b2(a1a2 . . . a,)] (4.2) where a, E dom(Ai) and G is the cylindrical extension of G. The fuzzy proposition Y, is G may either represent an integrity constraint, as in Example 4.1 given below, or may be the predicate of a select operation on the database. Example 4.1. In Table VII, an instance of young and intelligent students with relation scheme R(Name, Age, Height, Course, Marks) is shown. Now suppose that this relation must satisfy the fuzzy domain dependency "Students are Tall," where the fuzzy set tall is as given below. Tall = (0.40/150, 0.50/160, 0.65/165, 0.80/170, 0.90/175, 1.00/180) The particularization of the fuzzy relation in</figDesc></figure>

For this purpose, the following rules, called translation rules, of fuzzy calculus developed by Zadeh [53-M] may be used.Suppose F and G are fuzzy subsets of the universes U and V, respectively. As in Section 3.2, with atomic propositions X is F and Y is G we associate possibility distributions IIx and IIY, respectively, where IIx = F, and IIy = G.Tl. Modifier Rule. Consider the modified proposition X is uF, where g is a modifier, such as "not," "very," or "more or less." Each modifier is related to a function fc: [0, l] + [0, 11. The possibility distribution II; of the modified proposition X is aF is given by II; = F* (4.3) Here, F* is a fuzzy subset of U with membership function cLF*(u) = f&amp;F(d) for u E U (4.4) Thus the effect of the modifier is to generate a new possibility distribution on U that is uniquely determined by the modification function fO associated with the modifier and the possibility distribution function &amp;? of the atomic proposition. Following modification functions are recommended in the fuzzy set literature for some commonly used modifiers [20, 53-551. u = not, f&lt;(x) = l-x (4.51 u = very, fb(x) = x2 (4.61 u = more or less, fn(x) = Jx (4.7)</figDesc></figure>

In terms of possibility theory, ~EQ(U, b) can be interpreted as the possibility of treating a and b as "equal." The membership function ~EQ should be appropriately selected during database creation to capture the meaning of equality/approximate equality of domain values as perceived by the database designer.</figDesc></figure>

We can extend the definition of EQUAL over composite domains as follows. Let D = dom(Al) x dom(Az) x . . . x dom(A,), and tl, tz be two tuples in D. Suppose that in each dom(Ai), a fuzzy resemblance relation EQUAL with membership function piQ has already been defined to compare the elements of the domain. Then the fuzzy relation EQUAL, extended over D, defines a fuzzy subset of D X D, with the membership function as given below ~EQ(tl, tz) = ~~h&amp;Q(~~[&amp;l, tz.M), &amp;c&amp;[&amp;], h[&amp;l), . . . , &amp;&amp;~[%l, tzLW1 (5.2) In type-l fuzzy relations, dom(Ai) may be a fuzzy subset of the universe Ui. We can define resemblance of the elements of dom(Ai) by &amp;e(a, W = midda, b), dPAibh hi(b))) (5.3) where a, b E Ui, pn and pe are the membership functions of resemblance relations over Ui and [0, 11, respectively. It can be readily seen that /.QQ defined by (5.3) is reflexive and symmetric. Similarly, in a type-2 relation, we may define EQUAL over dom(Ai) by Cc&amp;(&amp;, ai2.j = I$$ G(Pql(Ui)s Pq2(Ui)) (5.4) where ail, 8i2 E dom(Ai) are fuzzy subsets of Ui and 9 is a resemblance relation over [0, 11. In the fuzzy set literature, several resemblance relations have been examined [20, 261. For example, 0(x1, xz) may be selected as 1 -] x1 -x2 1, or as l/O + I x1 -x2 ] ). It should also be mentioned that the definitions (5.3) and (5.4) are not unique ways of defining EQUAL over the domains of type-l or type-2 relations (for instance, see Example 5.1 given below). Example 5.1. Consider the relation scheme EMPLOYEE(N, D, J, X, S, I) and its instance r discussed in Example 3.3. In this case, some of the domain values are crisp, whereas dam(X), dam(S), and dam(1) are sets of fuzzy subsets. We select the following membership functions as measures of equality over different domains. (1) p~Q(u, b) = 0 for a # b, a, b E dam(A), A E (N, D, J]. In other words, names of the employees, departments, or jobs must exactly match to qualify for equality. (2) For a, b E dam(A), A E {X, S, 11, the following situations may arise. (i) The domain values a, b are both crisp (i.e., single element fuzzy set with binary membership value). In that case, PEQ(% b) = (l/(1 + Pla -b I), where /3 = 1 for a, b E dam(X), = l/2000 for a, b E dam(S), = l/500 for a, b E dam(1). (ii) If a is crisp and b is a fuzzy subset, than p~Q(u, b) = pb(a). Similarly, if b is crisp and a is a fuzzy subset, then p~Q(u, b) = p.(b). (Note, an ordinary subset such as 15-20 can be considered as a fuzzy subset with binary membership value.) (iii) If both a and b are fuzzy subsets, then pEQ(u, b) = max{c/curd(u), c/curd(b)], where curd denotes cardinality of a fuzzy set [20, 26, 551, and c = curd(u n b).</figDesc></figure>

By selecting suitable interpretations for the membership values, a fuzzy relational model is capable of representing ambiguities in the data values as well as impreciseness in the association among the entities of the database. Since one of the major objectives of fuzzy logic is to represent approximate reasoning used in natural languages, it is expected that in a database environment, appropriate blending of a relational data model and fuzzy logic will enhance the capabilities of the existing database systems. A brief survey of some of the existing proposals for using fuzzy logic in a relational database environment has also been presented. For a successful blending of fuzzy set theory and relational databases, it is, however, essential to develop a suitable design technique for such systems. In fact, it will be ideal if we can extend some of the widely investigated results in the classical relational database literature. In this quest, we have examined the properties of relational operators, especially projection and join of fuzzy relations. While attempting to extend the data dependencies in classical relations, it was observed that for comparing domain values, a suitable fuzzy measure such as EQUAL becomes useful. Treating "equality" as a fuzzy resemblance relation, a simple and natural extension of classical functional dependency, called fuzzy functional dependency, has been proposed. It has been shown that a fuzzy functional dependency can successfully represent integrity constraints that arise out of approximate equality of domain values. In spite of this generalization, the inference axioms for ffds are similar to Armstrong's axioms for classical fds. We have also been able to establish the completeness of these axioms for a class of</p></div>			</div>
