<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> are composed of a large number of heterogeneous nodes called sensors and actors. Sensors are low-cost, low-power, multi-functional devices that communicate untethered in short distances. The role of actors is to collect and process sensor data and perform appropriate actions. Hence, actors are resource-rich nodes equipped with bet-ter processing capabilities, higher transmission powers, and longer battery life.</p><p>In WSANs, a large number of sensor nodes, i.e., on the order of hundreds or thousands, are randomly deployed in a target area to perform a collaborative sensing task. Such a dense deployment is usually not necessary for actor nodes, since actors are sophisticated devices with higher capabilities that can act on large areas.</p><p>The collaborative operation of the sensor nodes enables the distributed sensing of a physical phenomenon. After sensors detect an event occurring in the environment, the event data is distributively processed and transmitted to the actors, which gather, process, and eventually reconstruct the event data. We refer to the process of establishing data paths between sensors and actors as sensor-actor coordination. Once an event has been detected, the actors coordinate with each other to make a decision on the most appropriate way to perform the action. We refer to this process as actor-actor coordination. As a result, the operation of a WSAN can be thought of to be an event-sensing, decision, and acting loop.</p><p>WSANs can be an integral part of systems such as battlefield surveillance, nuclear, biological or chemical attack detection, home automation and environmental monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. For example, in fire detection applications, sensors can relay the exact origin and intensity of the fire to water sprinkler actors so that the fire can easily be extinguished before it spreads. Similarly, motion and light sensors in a building can detect the presence of intruders, and command cameras or other instrumentations to track them. Furthermore, sensors for structural health monitoring in airplanes or spaceships can drive instruments to timely take countermeasures against critical mechanical stress or structural faults. As a last example, in earthquake scenarios sensors can help locate survivors and guide robots performing rescue operations.</p><p>In a way, WSANs can be considered a distributed control system that needs to timely react to sensor information with an effective action. For this reason, real-time coordination and communication in WSANs is an important concern so as to guarantee timely execution of the right actions. Some recent papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>[3] <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> have considered the issue of real-time communication in sensor networks. However, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, there are still many open research challenges in order to enable real-time communication and coordination in sensor networks, especially due to resource constraints and scalability issues. Besides, none of these works deals with sensor-actor coordination. The energy efficiency of network communications is also crucial, since sensors are resource-constrained nodes with limited battery lifetime and communication capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. Furthermore, sensor network protocols and algorithms should be scalable and localized, as the number of nodes can be arbitrarily high.</p><p>It has been recently shown in the literature that a fundamen-tal trade-off exists between energy and latency for data delivery in sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. For this reason, in WSANs it is required to deliver event data in an energy-efficient way while respecting real-time delay constraints. As far as scalability is concerned, it has been pointed out <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>[9] that the routing protocols that do not use geographical location information do not scale well in large networks. Conversely, the recent availability of small, inexpensive, and low-power GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers, together with techniques to deduce relative sensor coordinates from signal strengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, paved the way for Geographical Routing (also Position Based Routing) algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, which are becoming the most promising scalable solutions for critically energy-constrained sensor networks. Therefore, in this paper we study the sensor-actor coordination based on a geographical routing paradigm.</p><p>In order to guarantee scalability and energy efficiency, several solutions based on dividing the sensor network into different clusters have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>[13] <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Most of the existing clustering algorithms can be classified as topology dependent, i.e., clusters are predetermined, depend on the topology of the sensor network, and may be adaptively reconfigured to deal with mobility or failure of the sensor nodes. Usually, in topology-dependent clustering one of the sensors is elected as a cluster-head in each cluster. When an event occurs, each sensor is already associated with a cluster-head.</p><p>In this paper, we propose to base the sensor-actor coordination on a new event-driven clustering paradigm, where cluster formation is triggered by an event so that clusters are created on-the-fly to optimally react to the event. In our approach, sensors detecting an event coordinate with each other so as to optimally associate each sensor with an actor. This way, only the event area is clustered, and each cluster consists of those sensor nodes that send their data to the same actor. Hence, the event information is collected at the optimal actor nodes while existing energy resources are better utilized, since clusters are formed only when necessary, based on the event features and on the position of the actors. The resulting architecture is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The event-driven clustering approach also eliminates the communication overhead to maintain clusters before the event occurs, which is desirable especially in application scenarios where events are rare.</p><p>In addition, we introduce a model for actor-actor coordination. We define an optimization model for a class of coordination problems in which the area to be acted upon is optimally split among different actors depending on the actor capabilities.</p><p>The overall contribution of this paper is a comprehensive framework for coordination problems in WSANs, and can be outlined as:</p></div>

In Sections 2 and 3 we discuss the sensor-actor coordination problem. In particular, in Section 2 we state the sensor-actor coordination problem and propose an integer linear programming formulation, while in Section 3 we describe a distributed protocol for online solution of the problem. In Sections 4 and 5 we discuss the actor-actor coordination problem. In particular, in Section 4 we state the actor-actor coordination problem, while in Section 5 we introduce a distributed solution based on a real-time localized auction mechanism. Detailed comparative performance evaluation and simulation results are presented in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7 we draw the main conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SENSOR-ACTOR COORDINATION: PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>Since, as discussed in the previous section, sensor-actor communications may have real-time requirements, we introduce a novel notion of reliability that accounts for the percentage of total received packets that are received within a pre-defined latency bound (which we refer to as reliable packets). Unlike other notions of reliability, the definition introduced here is related to the real-time delivery of data packets from sources to actors. DEFINITION 1. The latency bound B is the maximum allowed time between the instant when the physical features of the event are sampled by the sensors and the instant when the actor receives a data packet describing these event features. A data packet that does not meet the latency bound B when it is received by an actor is said to be expired and thus unreliable. Similarly, a data packet received within the latency bound is said to be unexpired and thus reliable. DEFINITION 2. The event reliability r is the ratio of reliable data packets over all the packets received in a decision interval 1 . The event reliability threshold r th is the minimum event reliability 1 Whenever a packet is dropped by an intermediate sensor, either because it violates the latency bound constraint or because of net-required by the application. The lack of reliability is the difference (r thr) between the required event reliability threshold r th and the observed event reliability r at a given time. A negative lack of reliability indicates a reliability above the required threshold and is also referred to as an excess of reliability.</p><p>Note that the latency bound B and the event reliability threshold r th are dependent on the application requirements.</p><p>The sensor-actor coordination problem consists of establishing data paths from each sensor residing in the event area to the actors by i) ensuring that the observed reliability r is above the event reliability threshold r th (i.e., r ≥ r th ); ii) minimizing the energy consumption associated with data delivery paths.</p><p>We refer to our solution for the sensor-actor coordination problem as event-driven clustering with multiple actors and model it as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). In Sections 2.1 and 2.2 we describe the network and energy model, respectively. In Section 2.3 we provide the complete ILP formulation of the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Network Model</head><p>The network of sensor and actor nodes is represented as a graph G(S V , S E ), where S V = {v1, v2, . . . , vN } is a finite set of nodes (vertexes) in a finite-dimension terrain, with N = |S V |, and S E is the set of links (edges) among nodes, i.e., eij ∈ S E iff nodes vi and vj (also i and j for simplicity in the following) are within each other's transmission range. Let S A represent the set of actors, with NA = |S A |. We refer to an actor that is collecting traffic from one or more sources as a collector. Let S S be the set of traffic sources, with NS = |S S |. This set represents the sensor nodes that detect the event, i.e., the sensors that reside in the event area. Since the set of sources is disjoint from the set of actors, S A ⊂ S V , S S ⊂ S V , and S A ∩ S S = ∅.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Energy Model</head><p>An accurate model for energy consumption per bit at the physical layer is E = E trans elec + βd α + E rec elec , where E trans elec is a distance independent term that takes into account overheads of transmitter electronics (PLLs, VCOs, bias currents, etc.) and digital processing; E rec elec is a distance independent term that takes into account the overhead of receiver electronics, while βd α accounts for the radiated power necessary to transmit one bit over a distance d between source and destination. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, we assume that E trans elec = E rec elec = E elec . Thus, the overall expression simplifies to E = 2E elec + βd α , where α is the exponent of the path loss (2 ≤ α ≤ 5), β is a constant [Joule/(bits • m α )], and E elec is the energy needed by the transceiver circuitry to transmit or receive one bit [Joule/bits].</p><p>In our energy model we consider that, when a sensor node receives data from at least two other nodes, it aggregates the received information by data fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, i.e., a single packet is created by merging multiple incoming packets, thus reducing the amount of data to be tranmsitted. To effectively support this function, an algorithm for data fusion should be implemented on each sensor, which is out of the scope of this paper. Moreover, we ignore the processing cost in our model, since the processing cost is much lower than the communication cost. This is justified by experimental results on sensor network prototypes such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, where the energy necessary to transmit 1 kbit is shown to be equivalent to the energy necessary to execute 300,000 processor instructions. work or channel impairments, a short notification packet is sent to the actor, so that the lost packet can be taken into account in the computation of the reliability. Hence, in the definition "received packets" refers to the sum of data and notification packets</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Integer Linear Program</head><p>The objective of the optimization problem is to find data aggregation trees (da-trees) from all the sensors that reside in the event area (referred to as sources) to the appropriate actors. A da-tree is composed by aggregating individual flows, where a flow is defined as a connection between a sensor and an actor. All leaves in a da-tree are sources (but not all sources are necessarily leaves), and each actor is either the root of a da-tree or does not participate in the communication. Da-trees are constructed in such a way that each source belongs to one tree only and each tree has only one actor as its root. Therefore, each source is associated with an actor to achieve an optimal strategy for event-driven clustering.</p><p>In fact, event-driven clustering can be seen as a joint twofold problem: i) select the optimal subset of actors to which sensor readings will be transmitted; ii) construct the minimum energy da-trees towards those selected actors that meet the required event reliability constraint. Each tree implicitly defines a cluster, which is constituted by all source nodes in the tree. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> gives an example of this configuration.</p><p>The optimal strategy for event-driven clustering is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. The network topology is assumed to be 1-connected, i.e., at least one path exists between each sensor and actor. Note that this is not a strict requirement in dense sensor networks. We introduce the following notations that are used in the problem formulation: -eij is a binary variable representing a link, that equals 1 iff nodes i and j are within each other's transmission range; -cij is the cost of the link between nodes i and j, i.e., 2E elec +βd α ij , where dij represents the distance between nodes i and j; -x k ij is a binary variable that equals 1 iff link (i, j) is part of the da-tree associated with actor k; -f k,s ij is a binary variable that equals 1 iff node s sends data to actor k and link (i, j) is in the path from source s to actor k; -l k,s is a binary variable that equals 1 iff sensor s sends data to actor k; -pij is the propagation delay associated with link (i, j), defined as dij /v, where v is the signal propagation speed; -d is a parameter that accounts for the average sum of processing, queuing, and access delay at each sensor node; -B is the latency bound on each source-actor flow; -r and r th are the event reliability and the required event reliability threshold, respectively; -b k,s is a binary variable that equals 1 iff the connection between source s and actor k is not compliant with the latency bound, i.e., the end-to-end delay is higher than the latency bound B; -Q is the number of non-compliant sources.</p><p>The problem can be cast as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P Com M in : Event-Driven Clustering with Multiple Actors Given : eij, cij , pij, v, d, B, r th<label>(1)</label></formula><p>F ind :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x k ij , f k,s ij , l k,s , b k,s , r<label>(2)</label></formula><p>M inimize :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C T OT = È k∈S A È (i,j)∈S E x k ij • cij + γ • Q (3) Subject to : j∈S V (f k,s sj -f k,s js ) = l k,s , ∀s ∈ S S , ∀k ∈ S A ; (4) j∈S V (f k,s kj -f k,s jk ) = -l k,s , ∀s ∈ S S , ∀k ∈ S A ; (5) j∈S V (f k,s ij -f k,s ji ) = 0, ∀s ∈ S S , ∀k ∈ S A , ∀i ∈ S V s.t. i = s, i = k;<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">f k,s ij ≤ eij , ∀s ∈ S S , ∀k ∈ S A , ∀i ∈ S V , ∀j ∈ S V ;<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">f k,s ij ≤ x k ij , ∀s ∈ S S , ∀k ∈ S A , ∀i ∈ S V , ∀j ∈ S V ; (8) k∈S A l k,s = 1, ∀s ∈ S S ;<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">f k,s ij ≤ l k,s , ∀s ∈ S S , ∀k ∈ S A , ∀i ∈ S V , ∀j ∈ S V ; (10) ε • [B - (i,j)∈S E f k,s ij (pij + d)] ≤ b k,s , ∀s ∈ S S , ∀k ∈ S A ; (11) Q = k∈S A s∈S S b k,s ; r = |S S | -Q |S S | ≥ r th .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>The objective function in (3) minimizes the overall energy consumption and imposes a penalty by multiplying the number Q of non-compliant sources by a penalty coefficient γ whose value must be high enough (e.g., orders of magnitude higher than the energy consumption) to guarantee uniqueness of the solution. This allows minimizing the number of non-compliant sources Q (eq. 12) with a single-objective problem. As previously discussed, a flow is a connection between a source and an actor. Flows associated with the same actor are aggregated in a da-tree. Constraints (4), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), and (6) express conservation of flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, i.e., each source generates a flow, which is collected by an actor. In particular, constraint (4) guarantees that a source node generates a flow on the tree of the selected actor, and only on that one; while non-source nodes do not generate any flow. Constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref> requires that flows generated by each source be collected by one actor only. Constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref> imposes that the balance between incoming and outgoing flows is null for non-source and non-actor nodes. Constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref> ensures that flows are created on links between adjacent nodes (i.e., that are within transmission range of each other). Constraint (8) forces all flows from different sources but directed towards the same actor to be aggregated in the tree associated with that actor. Constraint (9) imposes that each source send data to exactly one actor. Constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> ensures that all flow variables from a source to a particular actor are zero unless that actor is selected by the source. Constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref> requires that the binary variable b k,s be equal to 1 always and only when the flow between source s and actor k violates the latency bound B. Note that the small negative coefficient ε is needed to scale the value of the difference between the delay and the delay bound to make it smaller than 1. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>, Q is defined as the number of non-compliant sources and the reliability r is constrained to be over the required threshold.</p><p>It can be shown that the problem P Com M in is at least as complex as the Geometric Connected Dominating Set problem, which is proven to be NP-complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Hence, P Com M in is NP-complete. However, it is still possible to solve P Com M in for networks of moderate size (up to 100 nodes), as will be shown in Section 6. This allows gaining some insight on the properties of the optimal solution, and using it as a benchmark for the performance of suboptimal, but more scalable algorithms, such as that introduced in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">SENSOR-ACTOR COORDINATION: DISTRIBUTED PROTOCOL</head><p>In this section, we introduce a scalable and distributed protocol to addresses the sensor-actor coordination problem in WSANs.</p><p>The objective of the protocol is to build energy-efficient da-trees between the sources that reside in the event area and the actors, in order to provide the required reliability r th with minimum energy expenditure. The proposed protocol constructs da-trees between sources and actors that can be seen as an approximate solution for the event-driven clustering with multiple actors problem, described in Section 2.</p><p>As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, in geographical routing algorithms localized routing decisions, i.e., based on localized topology information, can lead to data paths whose energy efficiency is close to the global optimum. This means that in densely deployed sensor networks topology information related to network regions that are "far" from where the routing decision is being taken are not essential. In fact, this information does not considerably influence the energy efficiency of the overall data path. For this reason, the objective of the proposed protocol is to minimize the energy consumption by relying on localized information and on greedy routing decisions. Conversely, complying with pre-determined delay bounds requires some form of end-to-end feedback. Hence, the proposed protocol favors local behavior for each individual sensor node that results in a global network behavior that is compliant with the application requirements, i.e., provide an event reliability r above the required threshold r th (defined in Section 2) and minimize the energy consumption. This is achieved by relying on feedback information from the actors/collectors.</p><p>In the description of the protocol, we assume that each sensor node is aware of: i) its position, as the sensor node can be equipped with a GPS receiver or the position can be determined by means of localization techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>; ii) the position of its neighbors, as every node periodically sends its position to its neighbors; iii) the position of the actors, as each actor periodically beacons its position in the sensor field; iv) the network is synchronized by means of one of the existing synchronization protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. A study on the impact of localization and synchronization errors is left for future work.</p><p>An important issue in geographical routing algorithms is to avoid the creation of loops in the data paths. Hence, before proceeding with an overview of the proposed protocol, we introduce some concepts related to path loop freedom that will be used in the description of the sensor-actor coordination framework. DEFINITION 3. Given nodes v and x, the absolute advance of node x, with respect to v, is the distance between v and its closest actor cv minus the distance between x and its closest actor cx<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> . DEFINITION 4. Given nodes v and x, the advance towards the collector c of x, with respect to v, is the distance between v and c minus the distance between x and c.</p><p>Intuitively, if x has positive absolute advance with respect to v, it means that x is closer than v to one (whatever) actor. If x has positive advance towards collector c with respect to v, x is closer than v to actor c. For any multi-hop path, a positive absolute advance at every hop guarantees loop freedom, irrespective of the final destination, since at each hop the packet is closer to a collector than at the previous hop. A positive advance towards an actor c at every hop guarantees a loop-free path from a source node to the actor c.</p><p>Most of the prior research in geographical routing protocols assumes that nodes can either work in a greedy mode or in a recovery mode. When in greedy mode, the node that currently holds the message tries to forward it towards the destination. The recovery mode is entered when a node fails to forward a message in the greedy mode, since none of its neighbors is a feasible next hop. Usually this occurs when the node observes a void region between itself and the destination. Such a node is referred to as concave node. Recovery mechanisms, which allow a packet to be forwarded to the destination when a concave node is reached, are out of the scope of this paper, since sensor networks are usually high density networks, and the probability of encountering void regions is very low. For this reason, the protocol proposed in this section assumes that no void regions exist, although it can be enhanced by combining it with one of the existing recovery mechanisms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>).</p><p>The objective of the proposed protocol is to create da-trees between the sources and a subset of the actors, referred to as collectors. A da-tree is thus created between each collector and the sources associated with that collector. This way, the set of sources is implicitly clustered, each cluster being composed of the sources associated with a single collector.</p></div>

An overview of the state transitions is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The main objective of these state transitions is to reduce the number of hops when the reliability requirement is violated and to save energy when the reliability requirement is met.</p><p>Source nodes add a timestamp value to the event data packet that they transmit to the actors, to allow the corresponding actors to compute the delay of each packet. For each decision interval, each actor then computes the event reliability r as the ratio of unexpired packets over all received packets (i.e., data and notifications) and periodically broadcasts its value. Sensor nodes associated with that collector base their state transitions on the reliability observed by the collector, which is broadcast at the end of each decision interval. When the advertised value r is below the so-called low event reliability threshold r - th , where r - th = r th -ǫ -, i.e., the lack of reliability (r th -r) is above a certain positive margin ǫ -, then it is necessary to speed-up the data delivery process by reducing the endto-end delay. Conversely, when the advertised value r is above the so-called high event reliability threshold r + th , where r + th = r th +ǫ + , i.e., the excess of reliability (rr th ) is above a certain margin ǫ + , then there is reliability in excess that can be traded off for energy savings. Note that the small coefficients ǫ + and ǫ -are needed to define a tolerance zone around the required reliability threshold for practical purposes (i.e., avoid instability). Good values for ǫ + and ǫ -find a good compromise between stability and tolerance and can be determined by simulation.</p><p>Each sensor node starts in an idle state, where it samples the environment for occurring events and monitors the channel for incoming data packets. A sensor enters the start-up state when it either senses an event or it receives the first data packet from a neighboring sensor. The collective operation of sensor nodes in the start-up state allows to timely establish paths to an actor for each source that resides in the event area. The paths established constitute a good compromise between latency and energy consumption.</p><p>Sensor nodes listen for feedback from the collector/actor they are associated with. If the event reliability r is below the low event reliability threshold r - th , it is necessary to reduce the sensor-to-actor delay, by reducing the end-to-end path length. Hence, when the reliability is advertised to be below the low reliability threshold (r &lt; r - th ), a sensor in the start-up state enters the speed-up state with probability Pst-sp, which is a monotonically increasing function of the lack of reliability. The notation [cond; P ] in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> indicates a transition occurring with probability P when the condition cond is verified.</p><p>If the event reliability r is above the high event reliability threshold r + th (i.e., r &gt; r + th ), it is possible to save energy. Hence, a node in the start-up state enters the aggregation state with probability Pst-ag, which is a monotonically increasing function of the excess of reliability, where it tries to minimize the energy consumption associated with its transmission by relaying data to the closest neighbor that participates in a da-tree.</p><p>Then, sensors can alternate between the speed-up and the aggregation state in order to respond to feedbacks from collectors. Hence, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, a sensor in the speed-up state enters the aggregation state with probability Psp-ag when r &gt; r + th , while a sensor in the aggregation state enters the speed-up state with probability Pag-sp when r &lt; r - th . Pag-sp increases with increasing advertised lack of reliability, while Psp-ag increases with increasing excess of reliability. The objective of our proposed protocol is to converge to a solution with reliability close to the event reliability threshold and minimal energy consumption.</p><p>Note that probabilistic policy prevents system oscillations that would occur if all sensors changed state at the same time. Clearly, the proposed algorithm is particularly effective when the time needed to set-up the tree is small as compared to the length of the subsequent monitoring and acting phase.</p><p>In the following we describe the operations of each state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Start-up State</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, a node enters the start-up state from the idle state when it detects an event, or when it receives a packet to be relayed to an actor.</p><p>The sensor node i in the start-up state, either as a source or as a relayer for a data packet, selects its next-hop based of the so-called two-hop rule. According to the two-hop rule, node i selects as next hop among its neighbors the node j that minimizes the sum of the energy consumption from i to j and the energy consumption from j to the actor closest to j, which is computed according to the energy model introduced in Section 2.2. Hence, the energy consumption Ej associated with a neighbor j of i is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Ej = 2E elec + βd α ij + 2E elec + βd α jc j ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where dij represents the distance between i and j while djc j repre- Inform nexthop that it is a relayer sents the distance between j and its closest actor cj . The two-hop rule selects as next hop the node j associated with the minimum two-hop energy consumption. As a result, the source-actor path will be established by applying the two-hop rule iteratively. Noticeably, since at each step the routing decision is independent of previous decisions, a packet intended for a certain actor by its generating source can be transmitted towards another destination actor by an intermediate node in the end-to-end path. For this reason, the collector actor transmits its identifier on the reverse da-tree in order to inform the source sensors about its own identity. The operations executed by a sensor node in the start-up state are detailed in Algorithm 1.</p><p>The two-hop rule produces loop-free paths, as stated below.</p><p>LEMMA 1. A next hop selected with the two-hop rule has a positive absolute advance (see Def. 3).</p><p>As a consequence, the two-hop rule produces a loop-free path between source and actor. We omit the proof of Lemma 1 because of page constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Speed-up State</head><p>The objective of the collaborative operation of nodes in the speedup state is to minimize the number of hops between sources and actors. This is achieved by applying the Greedy Routing Scheme (GRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> forwarding According to GRS, each sends the packet to the node closest to the destination within the transmission range. It is intuitive that this rule minimizes the number of hops in the path, the distance travelled by the packet, and the number of transmissions of the same data packet, along with the channel utilization. The pseudo-code of the operations executed by a sensor node in the speed-up state is reported in Algorithm 2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Aggregation State</head><p>The objective of the aggregation state is to reduce the overall energy consumption. To this end, sensor nodes in the aggregation state take routing decisions that reduce the global energy consumption, by relying on the data fusion algorithm that we assume to be implemented on each sensor. Since data packets can be aggregated by any node in the network, the objective of a node in the aggregation state is to route data to the closest node in its neighborhood that is part of da-tree. This way, the incremental energy consumption to collect the information from the considered sensor is minimized.</p><p>As previously discussed, after da-trees are established, each sensor knows which collector-actor it is associated with. By overhearing transmissions on the shared medium, each sensor learns which of its neighbors are part of a da-tree (as some neighbor sensors may not even be in the event-area) and which da-tree (if any) are they part of, i.e., which collector actor are they associated with. Hence, node v in the aggregation state first evaluates the cost of transmitting data to those among its neighbors that are part of a da-tree. This way, it can identify a minimum-cost neighbor, i.e., the neighbor vmin that requires minimum energy consumption to be reached among those associated with one of the da-trees. Two different situations can occur. The node vmin can either be on the same da-tree as v, and hence associated with the same collector; or it can be in a different da-tree.</p><p>If vmin is in the same da-tree as v, vmin can be selected as next hop by v only if it has a positive advance towards the collector that both nodes are associated with, i.e., if vmin is closer than v to the collector (see Def. 4). This guarantees loop freedom. In the resulting da-tree, every parent node is assured to have positive advance towards the collector, with respect to each child. When vmin is selected, the individual transmission cost for v is locally minimized and the overall cost of the tree is thus reduced. If vmin has no positive advance towards the collector with respect to v, v deletes vmin from the list of possible next hops and determines a new vmin among the remaining neighbors.</p><p>The other possible situation occurs when vmin is associated with a different collector than v, i.e., v and vmin are in two different da-trees. In this case, v is allowed to select vmin as its next hop only if v is a leaf in its da-tree and vmin has a positive advance towards its actor with respect to v. This guarantees loop-freedom of the overall tree, as every parent node is assured to have a positive advance towards the actor with respect to each child. Conversely, it can be easily shown that if non-leaf nodes are allowed to switch from one da-tree to another, loops may be created, as the condition that every parent node is closer to the actor than each child does not necessarily hold anymore. The detailed operations executed by a sensor node in the aggregation state are reported in Algorithm 3. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ACTOR-ACTOR COORDINATION: PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>The objective of actor-actor coordination is to select the best actor(s) to perform appropriate action on the event area. At the end of the sensor-actor coordination phase described in Section 3, one or multiple actors, which we denote as collectors, receive sensor readings from sources that sense the event. These sources define the event area. The event area corresponds to the action area, i.e., the area where the actors should act. In particular, each collector receives data from a subset of the sources (cluster in Section 2). Each cluster area identifies a portion of the action/event area and is under the responsibility of the corresponding collector. However, the collector may not be able to act on its entire responsible area, i.e., this area may not be totally within the collector's action range. The action range defines the circular area where an actor is able to act. Moreover, the collector may not be the "best" actor for that task in terms of action completion time and/or energy consumption, where the former is the time to perform the action and the latter is the required energy for the action. For these reasons, actor-actor coordination is required before initiating actions. DEFINITION 5. The action completion bound is the maximum allowed time from the instant when the event is sensed to the instant when the action is completed.</p><p>The coordination objective of each collector actor is to find the optimal actors to timely act on the portion of the event area under its own responsibility. In particular, if multiple actors can act on a certain area we refer to the area as an overlapping area (region areas numbered from 1 to 8 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). On an overlapping area the actor-actor coordination problem consists of selecting a subset of the actors and their action powers to optimally divide the action workload, so as to maximize the residual energy 3 of the actors while respecting the action completion bound, in order to extend the lifetime of the actors. We refer to an area where only one actor can act as non-overlapping area (unshaded regions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). For such an area, the coordination problem simplifies to selecting the power level for the actor that minimizes the energy consumption while respecting the action completion bound. For this reason, we assume that the coordination problem involves only overlapping areas and that the available energy of each actor is already discounted with the energy needed to act on non-overlapping areas.</p><p>In Section 4.1 we present the action area model and the actor model. These models are then used in the formulation of the problem in Section 4.2.</p></div>

The objective is to find, for each portion of the event area, the subset of actors that maximizes the average residual energy of all actors involved in the action, under the constraint of meeting the action completion bound. We define the problem according to the following assumptions: i) the energy required to perform the action is orders of magnitude higher than the energy required for communication; ii) actors are able to selectively act on part of their action area, i.e., if actor a is chosen to act either on an overlapping or non-overlapping area, this does not imply that it must act on the entire area A A a in its action range Ra.</p><p>Let us introduce the following notations: -P </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T (m) a,p = K • A C,m c,ov ηa • (P (m) a,p ) γ , (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where K [W γ • s/m 2 ] is a constant, and γ is an a-dimensional parameter ranging in (0, 1], which captures power inefficiencies; -δc [s] is the action completion bound (i.e., the maximum time for the action to be completed).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">ACTOR-ACTOR COORDINATION: LOCALIZED AUCTION PROTOCOL</head><p>In this section, we propose a distributed solution to the actoractor coordination problem stated in Section 4. In particular, our solution is inspired by the behavior of agents in a market economy, where the allocation of resources occurs as a result of interactions between buyers and sellers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. Our approach is based on a real-time auction protocol that describes the behavior of actors participating in transactions as buyers/sellers. The objective of the auction is to select the best set of actors to perform the action on each overlapping area. Thus, overlapping areas are items that are traded by the actors. The actors can assume the following roles: -Seller. Is the actor responsible for a portion of event area, i.e., the actor that receives event features for that area. It corresponds to a collector.</p><p>-Auctioneer. Is the actor in charge of conducting the auction on a particular overlapping area. An auctioneer is selected for each overlapping area by the collector/seller responsible for that area.</p><p>-Buyer. The actors that can act on a particular overlapping area are referred to as buyers for that area.</p><p>A localized auction takes place in each overlapping area. The bid of each actor participating in the auction consists of a power level and of the corresponding action completion time (i.e., the time needed by that actor to complete the action on the whole area) defined in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">14</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>, respectively, as well as the available energy of the actor. The objective is to maximize the total revenue of the team, where the team is constituted by the actors participating in the auction, and the revenue depends on the residual energy (i.e., E Res Avg , in Section 4). Multiple localized auctions take place in parallel under the responsibility of different auctioneers. This is preferable to one single auction conducted by the collector for several reasons: i) it causes lower signaling overhead, since the auction messages are exchanged between the auctioneer and the buyers for that overlapping area, which are close to the auctioneer. This way, the message exchange is localized since the messages are not forwarded to the collector, which may be far from the overlapping area; ii) the auction process workload is shared among a higher number of actors, since the number of auctioneers is in general higher than the number of collectors.</p><p>When seller c (the collector) receives the event features from the sensors, it decides whether an action needs to be performed on the area it is responsible for. It computes all the non-overlapping and overlapping areas, since it knows the position and action ranges of the other actors. The coordination problem arises for the overlapping areas where more than one actor can act, while for the nonoverlapping areas the seller directly assigns the action task to the corresponding actor.</p><p>Seller c selects Mc auctioneers, one for each overlapping area, among the actors that can act on each of these areas. Let s (m) ∈ S A be the auctioneer selected by seller c to conduct the auction for the m th overlapping area. This auctioneer is selected to be the closest actor to the center of the overlapping area. This way, since the auctioneer is close to each actor in the overlapping area, the energy spent for communication and the auction time is reduced. After selecting the auctioneer s (m) , the seller c provides it with the area A C,m c,ov where the auction should take place, the action completion bound δc, and the auction time bound τc, which is the maximum allowed time for the auction.</p><p>The auctioneer determines the winners of the auction based on the bids it receives from the buyers. At the beginning of the auction, the auctioneer sends a JOIN AUCTION message to all the buyers competing for the area. After a buyer a hears this announcement, it submits its available energy, E Av a , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">L two-dimensional bids ba = {b 1 a , b 2 a , . . . , b L a }, where b (p) a = [P (m) a,p , T<label>(m)</label></formula><p>a,p ], p = 1, 2, . . . , L, with P (m) a,p and T (m) a,p defined in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">15</ref>), respectively. By means of these bids, the auctioneer determines the winners by calculating the optimal solution for the residual energy maximization problem P Res M ax defined in Section 4.2. However, in this case the problem is limited to the overlapping area the auctioneer is responsible for. This way, since the bids are submitted to the auctioneer only once, signaling overhead is reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. In microeconomic theory, our auction mechanism can be classified as a single-round sealed-bid auction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, where each buyer submits its bids in one shot irrespective of the bids from other buyers. In other words, the auctioneer receives the bids from the buyers only once and then determines the winners (i.e., the optimal set of actors, and their power levels) accordingly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Sensor-Actor Coordination</head><p>The optimization problem presented in Section 2.3 was implemented with AMPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, and solved with CPLEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, which uses a branch and bound algorithm to solve mixed integer linear problems. The start-up, speed-up, and aggregation states, described in Section 3, were implemented in a C++ network-layer simulator and in the J-Sim Simulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, which implements the whole protocol stack of a sensor node, from physical to application layer, including 802.11 MAC, UDP transport and CBR traffic. All figures in this section report 95% confidence intervals. We considered three different simulation scenarios. In Scenario 1, the deployment area is circular with radius equal to 20m. For each deployed sensor, the distance from the center of the area and the angle are uniformly distributed random variables. In Scenario 2, sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a square area of 25m x 25m. The event area is circular, with varying radius ranging in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>m in different simulations. The epicenter of the event area is randomly selected such that the event area completely falls into the terrain. Scenario 3 is similar to Scenario 2, but the side of the square area is 100m. Four actors are randomly deployed in each scenario. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, the simulation parameters for the energy model in Section 2.2 are chosen to be E elec = 50nJ/bit, β = 100pJ/bit/m α , α = 4. The transmission range of sensors is set to 10m.</p><p>Since the global network behavior depends on several applicationdependent parameters, we present performance evaluation results of particular network configurations that constitute upper and lower bounds on the achievable performance. Hence, in this section we refer to start-up configuration, speed-up configuration, and aggregation configuration, as those configurations where all nodes are in the start-up, speed-up, and aggregation state, respectively. This allows us to describe how the evolution among different states impacts the overall network performance and show the benefits of the proposed solution without making it dependent on the choice of parameters that govern the transitions among different states. Evaluating and tuning the dependence of network dynamics on the parameters that govern the transitions of nodes among the various states is left for future work.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows a comparison between the optimal solution to the event-driven clustering problem described in Section 2 and the energy consumption in the start-up, speed-up, and aggregation configuration in Section 3, respectively, with varying event ranges. The overall network cost (energy needed to transmit one bit from each source to the actors) is reported in the figure. Noticeably, the optimal solution is almost independent of the event range. This happens because of two contrasting phenomena. The number of sources increases when the event range increases, leading to a po- tentially higher energy consumption; conversely, since more nodes are involved, aggregation can be increasingly leveraged. These two trends compensate each other leading to a flat curve. Conversely, the energy consumption in the start-up and speed-up configurations highly increases with the event range. As also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, this can be partially compensated by the benefits of the aggregation state. In particular, an aggregation configuration can be reached both from a start-up configuration and from a speed-up configuration. An aggregation configuration reached from a start-up configuration leads to an almost-optimal energy consumption, where as by reaching the aggregation configuration from a speed-up configuration, the energy consumption can still be decreased consistently, but not as much as in the previous case. The structure of the datrees after the start-up/speed-up configuration somehow constrains an aggregation process based on simple logic and minimal interaction among sensors. Hence, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> motivates the design of our three-state distributed protocol for sensor-actor coordination. In fact, the distributed solution described in Section 3 adapts the structure of the da-trees to reach an energy configuration that is between the speed-up line and the aggregation from start-up line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. Depending on the required latency bound and reliability threshold, after a transient start-up configuration, a certain number of sensors will enter the speed-up/aggregation state to reach a minimum energy configuration, given the required reliability. When a higher reliability is required, the network will move towards a higher energy/lower delay configuration, while when the required reliability is guaranteed with some margin, the network will move towards a lower energy configuration.</p><p>In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> we plot the average energy consumption versus the number of sensors and with different event ranges, for the start-up, and aggregation configurations in Scenario 2. As can be seen, the energy expenditure of the aggregation configuration is two orders of magnitude lower than in the start-up configuration (tens of thousands of nJ versus hundreds of nJ). This clearly shows the benefits of the aggregation configuration. As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>, the energy expenditure increases less than the number of sensors, i.e., by doubling the number of sensors the energy expenditure is less than doubled. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> reports the overall energy consumption for the speed-up configuration. Interestingly enough, not only is the energy consumption of the speed-up configuration around one order of magnitude higher than in the start-up configuration; also, as already seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, when the aggregation configuration is   reached from a speed-up configuration, the network converges to a less energy-efficient configuration with respect to the case when the aggregation configuration is reached directly from the start-up configuration. This is confirmed by Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, which shows that the order of magnitude of the energy consumption is 10 4 nJ for an aggregation configuration reached from a speed-up configuration. Conversely, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, in Scenario 2 the average number of hops of each source-actor pair is reduced from around 5 hops for the start-up configuration to less than 2 hops in the speed-up configuration. This explains the rationale for the design of the distributed algorithm in Section 3. The speed-up configuration leads to paths with lower delay (lower number of hops and straight towards the destination); however, since this is paid with a higher energy consumption, the speed-up mechanism should be used only when strictly necessary to provide the required reliability.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">[nJ] Event Range=2 [m] Event Range=4 [m] Event Range=6 [m] Event Range=8 [m] Event Range=10 [m] Event Range=12 [m]</formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">[nJ] Event Range=2 [m] Event Range=4 [m] Event Range=6 [m] Event Range=8 [m] Event Range=10 [m] Event Range=12 [m]</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref> shows the overall energy consumption for the startup, speed-up, and aggregation configurations in Scenario 3, with 1000 nodes. Although the speed-up configuration can be seen to lead to a higher energy consumption, the energy consumptions of the start-up and speed-up configurations are in the same order of magnitude, i.e., the behavior of the speed-up configuration is sim-    ilar to that of the start-up configuration. This happens when the transmission range of the nodes is short with respect to the distance between sensors and actors. In this case, a node in the start-up state tends to select the closest node to the destination (as it would do in the speed-up configuration). In fact, when the distance between the sensor and the actor is much larger than the transmission range, the second term in the sum of the two-hop rule accounts for most of the energy expenditure (see Section 3.2). In fact, the distance between the sensor and any of its neighbors is short as compared to the distance between the neighbor and the actor. Thus, the neighbor is selected so as to minimize the second term, which, as can be easily demonstrated, results in selecting the neighbor that is closest to the destination (as also a node in the speed-up state does). Nevertheless, Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows that the speed-up configuration still outperforms the start-up configuration in terms of number of hops, while this is achieved with a limited additional energy expenditure. More importantly, this is reflected in the distribution of packet delays, where the speed-up configuration always leads to lower delays than the start-up configuration. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref> show a comparison of packet delays from sensor to actor in Scenario 3, with 400 nodes, between the speed-up and the start-up configuration when the event range is set to 12m, which corresponds to 20 sources in average. In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11(a</ref>  application dependent, in these simulations we do not drop packets at intermediate nodes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">[nJ] Event Range=2 [m] Event Range=4 [m] Event Range=6 [m] Event Range=8 [m] Event Range=10 [m] Event Range=12 [m]</formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">[nJ] Event Range=2 [m] Event Range=4 [m] Event Range=6 [m] Event Range=8 [m] Event Range=10 [m] Event Range=12 [m]</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Actor-Actor Coordination</head><p>In this section, we discuss some performance results of the actoractor coordination problem defined in Section 4. The model of the MINLP problem was implemented in AMPL and solved with the MINLP solver available through the NEOS Optimization Server <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref>, we compare the average residual energy with three different solution approaches, namely, the optimal (Section 4.2), 1-actor and localized auction (see Section 5). In the optimal solution, the best set of actors is chosen so that the average residual energy of the actors involved is maximized, while guaranteeing that the action is completed before the action completion time. In the 1-actor heuristic, the action is performed by one actor only for each overlapping area, i.e., the actor with the highest available energy. In the localized auction each overlapping area is taken care of by an auctioneer that splits it among the actors based on their bids, as discussed in Section 5. In the experiments performed, we concentrate on a scenario with three overlapping areas. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref>, the localized auction mechanism leads to near-optimal residual energy, as each auctioneer calculates the optimal solution separately for its overlapping area. However, this greatly simplifies the problem and can be achieved with local communications among actors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We presented a coordination framework for Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSANs), and discussed the sensor-actor and actoractor coordination problems. We developed an optimal solution for the sensor-actor coordination based on event-driven clustering, and formulated it as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We also proposed a distributed solution that includes an adaptive mechanism to trade off energy consumption for delay when the event data has to be delivered to the actors within pre-determined latency bounds. For the actor-actor coordination, an optimization model was defined for a class of coordination problems in which the area to be acted upon is optimally split among different actors. The problem was formulated as a mixed integer non-linear problem, and an auction-based localized solution of the problem was presented. Future work will be focused on extending the performance analysis of the proposed solutions, e.g., parameter fine tuning, and on generalizing the framework to capture different applications scenarios, including those requiring mobile actors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Event-driven clustering with multiple actors.</figDesc></figure>

The variability of packet delays is reported as well as the cumulative average with time. In the start-up configuration, delays are shown to be high in the transient phase at the beginning of the simulation. The average delay (thick line in the figure) converges to a value around 0.3s. In the speed-up configuration delays are much smaller, and their average is below 0.1s. Figures11(c)-11(d) show the distribution of delays in the same scenario. In the speed-up configuration (Fig.11(d)), the delay is below 0.5 s for almost 100% of the packets, while in the start-up configuration (Fig.11(c)) the variability of delays is much higher and their value can be as high as 2.5s.Figures12(a) and 12(b) refer to the same scenario, where each source generates 5 packets per second, for the start-up and speedup configurations, respectively. Noticeably, while in the start-up configuration the network is congested (Fig.12(a)), leading to extremely high values for the delays, this does not happen in the speed-up configuration, where the delays are shown to be almost always within 1s (Fig.12(b)).
