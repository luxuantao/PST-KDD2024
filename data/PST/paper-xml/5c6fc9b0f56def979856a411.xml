<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, the security problems in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) against replay attack are considered. With replay attacks, attacker records and covers the transmitted data between the senders and receivers of the sensors. In order to achieve the detection objective for malicious replay attacks, the stochastic coding scheme is proposed to make the CPSs generate covariance differences between the normal and compromised data. Different from the existing results, this method detects the replay attack without sacrificing any system performances in normal systems. Based on the coding scheme, two types of detectors are further designed to detect the covariance changes in residual and output, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The emergence of cyber-physical systems is boosted by the rapid development of network communication technology. Such complex systems feature tight coordination between the information network and physical process. Many critical infrastructures are considered as CPSs, such as smart grid, transportation and medical monitoring. The complexity and openness have made CPSs vulnerable to malicious behavior in cyber fields, for instance, deliberately attack which sabotages facilities and inflicts economic damage. Thus, security is a significant focus for the deployment of CPSs and continue to attract many attentions in the view of control theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Recently, the researchers mainly focus on the stability and security of control systems equipped with networked communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, especially sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. To defense the malicious attack, the ability of detecting their invasion action becomes extremely important in the security challenges of CPSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</p><p>The well-modeled attacks include denial-of-service attack (DOS), deception attack and replay attack. DOS attack hampers the transmission channels in the network layer, and some frameworks for modeling the attack actions are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Considering finite attack times, an optimal DOS attack scheme against the remote estimator is provided to maximize the estimation error <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. To stabilize the CPSs under DOS attack with constrained frequency and duration, a series of schemes based on ISS stable and Lyapunov theory is researched <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the secure consensus problems against DoS attacks in the multi-agent systems are researched, and the attacks occur in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>the transmission channels of communication topology (the edges of the graph). Recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, a detection and compensation mechanism is studied for a class of DoS attack, whose occurrence probability satisfies Bernoulli-distributed.</p><p>Deception attack refers to the behavior of modifying the transmitted information over the networks to influence data's integrity and availability and keep the intrusion stealth simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the sensor and actuator attacks are both considered, and an adaptive secure control scheme against the attacks is designed with the known sign of the compromised sensor measurements. Furthermore, to improve the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a control scheme based on barrier Lyapunov function and Nussbaum function is studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In some results such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, the attacks or induced phenomena in CPSs are described as stochastic behaviors. A security control scheme is developed based on the input-to-state stability in probability(ISSiP) theory against a class of stochastic deception attacks, whose success probability obeys Bernoulli-distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For multi-sensor fusion procedures, some different detection scenarios against deception attacks are investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where a novel type of detector is designed with both normal and compromised system information. In sensor networks, a novel filter structure is developed to achieve the distributed filtering with the credible measurements from each sensor itself and attacked measurements from its neighbors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. It is worthy to notice that the attacker may more or less acquire some information of system dynamics to implement an optimal DoS or deception attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, replay attack can destroy the CPSs even without any information of the external structure. For this reason, replay attack is the easiest attack to be implemented for malicious objectives. The attacker records and covers the transmitted data in network aspect such that it influences the close-loop features of CPSs and degrade the system performances. This attack form is frequently reported in industrial control systems. For example, Irans nuclear centrifuges accident is the most typical crisis caused by replay attack, which is achieved by Stuxnet. In this accident, centrifuges are forced to crazily rotate, but the anomalies are covered by replay attacks. Although this accident causes serious damage, it aroused people's attention to cyber security. Moreover, some accidents caused by replay attacks in water systems are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In fact, the detection of replay attack is difficult to deploy, but it is vitally important for system security. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, a recording-horizon control law is provided to deal with the replay attack over the communication network between controller and actuators. Under bandwidth constraints, a secure fusion estimation scheme is proposed for CPSs against replay attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. An additional Gaussian signal is injected into the actuators to detect the replay attack when the system performances are sacrificed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Based on this detection countermeasure, a stochastic game approach is developed to decrease the loss in control performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, performance degradation implies life reduction of equipment or economic loss, and it is not accepted when systems run for years. Hence, a detection scheme without performance loss is urgently needed for the security problems in CPSs against replay attacks.</p><p>From the defender's standpoint, a detection method is developed against replay attacks on sensor measurements without performance degradation in normal systems. The detailed contributions are summarized as follows:</p><p>1) Firstly, a new stochastic coding scheme, which codes a Gaussian signal into the transmitted channels between the sensors and processors, is proposed to generate covariance difference of the compromised data. Then, the detection problem of replay attack can be transferred to find a test method for distinguishing the covariance changes in compromised systems.</p><p>2) In order to detect the covariance changes caused by the stochastic coding scheme, a residualbased detector is designed by the likelihood-ratio test subject to the given false alarm rate (FAR) and attack detection rate (ADR) limitations. Furthermore, since the output measurements are only influenced by the covariance changes in current time, we propose an output-based detector design method instead of using residual information. It is also effective to the systems without Kalman filters or state observers, and reduces the design complexity of the above-mentioned residual-based detector.</p><p>3) Different from the traditional χ 2 detector, the above residual-based and output-based detectors apply a novel form, which uses the compromised covariance information of the coding signal. With this method, the non-convex constraint in design optimization problems is removed.</p><p>4) For both residual-based and output-based detectors, the relationships between the covariance</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>of the coding signal, the threshold value of detector, the possibilities of false alarm and attack detection are established in the optimization problem. With the stochastic coding scheme and the novel detectors, the replay attacks are detected with the given FAR and ADR, and the performance degradation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> can be removed in the normal system. This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the system models and some preliminaries about the replay attack. In Section III, the stochastic coding model is first introduced to elaborate the changes in compromised systems, and further residual-based and output-based detectors are designed based on the coding scheme, respectively. Finally, a practical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the provided scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Problem Formulation and Preliminaries</head><p>The CPS is modeled by the following discrete-time linear system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x k+1 = Ax k + Bu k + w k , y k = Cx k + v k ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x k ∈ R n is the state vector, u k ∈ R nu is the control input and y k ∈ R m is the output vector of the sensor measurements. A, B and C are the known matrices with appropriate dimensions. (A, B) and (C, A) are assumed to be completely controllable and observable, respectively. w k and v k are the independent Gaussian random white noise, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w k ∼ N (0, Q), v k ∼ N (0, R). (A, √ Q) is assumed</formula><p>to be controllable. The initial state x 0 is independent of w k and v k , and obeys x 0 ∼ N (x 0 , Σ).</p><p>In order to obtain the state estimations, the following Kalman filter is implemented by the principle of minimum mean square error.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">xk+1|k = Ax k + Bu k , P k+1|k = AP k A T + Q, L k = P k|k-1 C T (CP k|k-1 C T + R) -1 , xk = xk|k-1 + L k (y k -C xk|k-1 ), P k = P k|k-1 -L k CP k|k-1 .</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">)<label>2</label></formula><p>According to the mentioned observability of (C, A), the time-varying Kalman gain L k , and error covariance P k and P k|k-1 will converge to a steady-state L, P and P , respectively. Then, the covariance P and P are obtained by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P = AP A T + Q -AP C T [CP C T + R] -1 CP A T , P = P -P C T [CP C T + R] -1 CP.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is equipped to guarantee the stability of the system (1) and minimize the following index <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">J = lim T →∞ min u0,••• ,uT 1 T E T -1 k=0 (x T k M x k + u T k N u k ) ,</formula><p>where M and N are the positive semi-definite matrices. In the sequel, the control input is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">u k = -(B T U B + N ) -1 B T U Ax k K xk where U satisfies U = A T U A + M -A T U B(B T U B + N ) -1 B T U A.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Assume that the attacker can record the data measured by the sensors and modify them at arbitrary times. When the sensor measurements are replaced by the past data, the compromised systems is modeled as follows: where y k is the past sensor output vector recorded by the attacker. It makes the estimations of the system states change, and indirectly influence the control performance. Notice that y k is generated by the past systems, whose initial value is equal to the real system, i.e., x 0 = x 0 and x 0|-1 = x0|-1 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x k+1 = Ax k + Bu k + w k , y k = Cx k + v k , xk+1|k = Ax k + Bu k , xk = xk|k-1 + L k (y k -C xk|k-1 ),<label>(5)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>The compromised systems architecture, attack processes and positions are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Assumption 1. The system parameters satisfy (A + BK)(I -LC) is stable.</p><p>Remark 1. When the replay attacks launch, the residual may converge or diverge. As it has been investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, if the system parameters satisfy (A + BK)(I -LC) is stable, the residual z k converges under replay attacks, otherwise, the residual diverges. In fact, when residual diverges, the evaluation value g k of detector is always larger than the threshold value after a certain time. As a result, the replay attack can be detected if residual diverges. However, when residual converges, the replay attacks are hard to be detected since the residual covariances in compromised and normal systems are same. Thus, we focus on dealing with this case. Here, the stochastic coding scheme will be designed to increase the residual covariance when replay attacks are launched.</p><p>Remark 2. When systems suffer from replay attack, the closed-loop control structure is destroyed and the plant performance is difficult to be guaranteed. Furthermore, replay attacks can hide the other attacks without stealthiness in actuators or physical layer, which is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. This condition like the criminal hacks into the monitor when he/she commits a crime. Those hidden attacks can wantonly break systems and not be detected because the measurements are covered by replay attacks. However, when the replay attacks are detected and eliminated by operators, the other attacks without stealthiness are naturally exposed to the defender. Hence, here we only consider detecting the replay attacks in sensors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Stochastic Coding Scheme for Detecting Replay Attack</head><p>Different from the existing noisy control scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, in this section a stochastic coding scheme is firstly proposed to eliminate the system performance degradation effectively. For the detection purpose, the coding scheme generates covariance changes after the replay attack occurring. Then two detectors are designed based on the proposed stochastic coding scheme to detect the covariance changes caused by replay attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Stochastic Coding Model</head><p>Since the recording data is extracted from the normal systems, it is difficult to detect the potential attack only by the general χ 2 detector. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method to expand the distinction between the past and current data, and further expose the attack. The following stochastic coding scheme is provided to achieve this task.</p><p>We transmit the sensor measurements coded by an additional signal to the controller as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Y c k =y k + y * k = Cx k + v k + y * k ,<label>(6)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>where the addition signal is Gaussian white process, i.e., y</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">* k ∼ N (0, Σ * ). Σ * = diag(σ 1 , • • • , σ n ).</formula><p>Then the receiver decodes the transmission packet as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Y d k =Y c -y * k = y k = Cx k + v k .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Obviously, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the receiver obtains the real sensor measurements in normal systems, which demonstrates this method causes no performance degradation compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 3. In networked systems, the realization of coding schemes often requires the senders and receivers own the knowledge of coding signal simultaneously. Thus, here we establish the stochastic codes as deterministic pseudo-stochastic signals in practical application and use a group of seeds to previously save different pseudo-stochastic signals. Then, the sensor measurements can be coded according to the number of transmission packet rather than the transmission time. Furthermore, every stochastic value of the coding signal can be held for n sampling time, which is described as a special asynchronous coding problem. As n increase, the sender and receiver are easier to synchronize coding signals. And this asynchronous coding scheme for detecting the replay attacks will be studied in our future works.</p><p>As a result, the coding and decoding process under replay attack can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Y c k =y k + y * k = Cx k + v k + y * k , Y d k =Y c k -y * k = Cx k + v k + (y * k -y * k ) =y k + ȳ * k ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where ȳ * k y ky * k , and ȳ * k ∼ N (0, 2Σ * ) only occur when the replay attacks exist. Remark 4. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, we know the decoded data in the controller is the same as the measurements of sensors, i.e., Y d k = y k . This implies stochastic code results in no influence in the normal systems. Conversely, a Gaussian stochastic signal ȳ * k is brought into the compromised system in (8) so that the covariance is increased when the replay attacks exist. However, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, it injects a stochastic signal into both normal and compromised systems to expose the replay attacks. But the controller performance reduces with the covariance of the stochastic signal increasing. Hence, comparing with <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, no performance degradation in normal systems is a superiority of the stochastic coding scheme.</p><p>Remark 5. This coding scheme is motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, but the strategies are different. Firstly, the coding scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> applies a multiplicative code to detect the false data injection attacks, while here we use additive code to detect the replay attacks. Moreover, the coding matrix in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is developed to break the necessary and sufficient condition of false data injection attacks. In this paper, we equip the coding scheme to generate covariance differences between normal and compromised systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Residual-based Detector</head><p>Owe to the injecting of the stochastic signal, the residual covariance occurs changes in the compromised system.</p><p>We first analyze the covariance of residual in normal systems and compromised systems.

The stochastic coding scheme transforms the detection problems of replay attacks to test the changes in residual covariance.

Denote the resistance, inductance, capacitance, current and supply voltage as R, L, C, I and E, respectively. The two sensors, digital ammeter and voltmeter, are used to measure current and voltage on the capacitor, respectively. The measurements are transmitted to processing unit (computing control inputs and state estimations) by network communication, and process unit transmits the control signal to pulse width modulator (PWM) to control the supply voltage E over networks. Attacker replays the current and voltage measurements with past data over the networks. Finally, the detector collects the information in process unit to judge whether to alarm.</p><p>Borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, then RLC system is described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">x 1(k+1) x 2(k+1) = T RC -T R L + 1 -T RC T RC 1 -T RC x 1k x 2k + T R L 0 u k + w k , y 1k y 2k = 1 0 0 1 x 1k x 2k + v k ,</formula><p>where x 1 = I is capacitor current, x 2 = e = (1/C) Idt is capacitor voltage and control input u = E is supply voltage. The process and measurement noises satisfy w k ∼ N (0, I) and v k ∼ N (0, I), respectively. Choose R = 10Ω, L = 10H, C = 0.1F and sampling interval T = 0.1s. To guarantee the closed-loop system stable, the filter and controller steady-state gains are designed as follows based on the principles in Section II. L = 0.619 0.0014 0.0014 0.5986 , K = -10.0838 -1.1313 .</p><p>Firstly, under the same 5% FAD and three different ADRs, the optimal results in our paper and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> are given in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>-II, respectively. It can be seen that the covariances Σ * in both <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and our paper increase as the corresponding ADRs increase. Moreover, no performance degradation exists in our paper while the performance degradation J in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is bigger as the ADRs increase.   Then, some simulation results of the stochastic coding scheme under replay attack will be given. Suppose the attacker records the sensor measurements for the first 5s, and replays them in the transmission channel between sensors and controller processing unit for the next 5s. Next, both the residual-based and output-based schemes are used to show the effectiveness. which is obtained by the optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. The corresponding FAR and ADR limitations are chosen as α = 5% and β = 75%, respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the evaluated value g k in normal systems, which is always lower than the threshold  value τ . The detection condition in the compromised system is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, and it is easy to see the detection rate against replay attack is significantly large after 5s, which implies the coding scheme can effectively expose the replay attack. To depict the performance of the designed coding signal and detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve are given in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.

Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> exhibits the detection behavior of the stochastic coding scheme against the replay attack. It has been shown that the attack detection rate is very small before 5s and increases extremely large after 5s. The ROC curve of detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> to reveal the performance of the output-based detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, which is similar with the performance of residual-based detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> in Case 1.</p><p>Moreover, it can be seen that the covariance Σ * of coding signal for the residual-based detector (16) in Case 2 is much larger than that for the output-based detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">16</ref>), the output-based detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> has less communication loads and less design complexity in this example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper studies the detection problems against replay attack in CPSs based on coding sensors transmitting information. The stochastic coding scheme injects a designed coding signal into the transmitted channel of sensors information, and it can further generate enough covariance differences between normal and compromised systems. In order to detect the covariance changes in the compromised system, the residual-based and output-based detectors are developed by the likelihoodrate test. In particular, this way achieves the detection objectives without sacrificing any system performances in normal systems. Given the false alarm rate and attack detection rate limitations, the design of stochastic coding signal is described as an optimization problem. Finally, a practical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed code-based detection method. In the future, we will focus on the asynchronous coding scheme to further increase the data synchronization capability of senders and receivers for detecting replay attacks.</p></div>
