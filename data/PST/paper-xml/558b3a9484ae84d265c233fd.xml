<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>S PECTRAL UNMIXING (SU) is one of the major issues when analyzing hyperspectral images. SU consists of identifying the macroscopic materials present in an hyperspectral image and quantifying the proportions of these materials in the image pixels. Most SU strategies assume that pixel reflectances are linear combinations of pure component spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The resulting linear mixing model (LMM) has been widely used in the literature and has provided interesting results. However, as explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the LMM can be inappropriate for some hyperspectral images, such as those containing sand, trees, or vegetation areas. Nonlinear mixing models provide an interesting alternative for overcoming the inherent limitations of the LMM. They have been proposed in the hyperspectral image literature for specific kinds of nonlinearities. More precisely, the bidirectional reflectance-based model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> has been introduced for hyperspectral images including intimate mixtures. Conversely, the bilinear models recently studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> address the problem of scattering effects, mainly observed in vegetation areas. Other more flexible unmixing techniques have been also proposed to handle a wider class of nonlinearity, including radial basis function networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and kernel-based models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This paper considers a class of nonlinear mixing models referred to as postnonlinear mixing models (PNMMs). PNMMs are flexible generalizations of the standard LMMs that have been introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for source separation problems. The main advantage of PNMMs is that they can accurately model many different nonlinearities (as will be shown in this paper). This paper addresses the problem of supervised SU of hyperspectral images using PNMMs. Note that "supervised" means that the endmembers contained in the image have been estimated by an endmember extraction algorithm (EEA). As a consequence, the only parameters to be estimated are the abundances and the nonlinearity coefficients for all pixels of the image. In the last decades, many EEAs have been developed to identify the pure spectral components contained in a hyperspectral image (the reader is invited to consult <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for a recent review of these methods). Most EEAs implicitly rely on the LMM and might be inappropriate for nonlinear models such as PNMMs. However, as noticed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, geometric EEAs are still adapted to identify endmembers and can be reasonably employed when the mixing model involves nonlinearities. Therefore, this paper proposes to extract the endmembers contained in the hyperspectral image using a geometric EEA, known as vertex component analysis (VCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The recent nonlinear EEA introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is also considered. Once the endmembers have been extracted from the image, we propose to estimate the abundances and the nonlinearity parameters involved in the PNMM using estimation algorithms based on Bayesian and least-square (LS) methods.</p><p>In the Bayesian framework, appropriate prior distributions are chosen for the unknown PNMM parameters. The joint posterior distribution of these parameters is then derived. However, the classical Bayesian estimators cannot be easily computed from this joint posterior. To alleviate this problem, a Markovchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to generate samples according to the posterior of interest. As in any Bayesian algorithm, the joint posterior distribution can be also used to compute confidence intervals for the parameter estimates. However, the resulting computational complexity can be too heavy for practical applications. In order to reduce this computational complexity, we propose to study LS methods that have already received considerable attention in the hyperspectral imagery <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A first method based on Taylor series expansions is proposed to iteratively solve the LS criterion associated with the PNMM observation model. The Taylor approximations allow quadratic optimization problems to be solved at each iteration.</p><p>A second approach is based on a classical gradient method dedicated to constrained problems. This paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the PNMM for hyperspectral image analysis. Section III presents a Bayesian unmixing algorithm associated with the proposed PNMM. Section IV studies the two alternative unmixing algorithms based on LS methods. Some simulation results conducted on synthetic and real data are shown and discussed in Section V. Conclusions are finally reported in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. POLYNOMIAL PNMM</head><p>This section defines the nonlinear mixing model used for hyperspectral image SU. More precisely, the -spectrum of a mixed pixel is defined as a nonlinear transformation of a linear mixture of spectra contaminated by additive noise, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is the spectrum of the th material present in the scene, is its corresponding proportion, is the number of endmembers contained in the image, and is an appropriate nonlinear function. Moreover, is the number of spectral bands, and is an additive independent and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian noise sequence with variance , denoted as , where is the identity matrix. Note that the usual matrix and vector notations and have been used in the right-hand side of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>The choice of an appropriate nonlinearity deserves a specific attention. Polynomials, sigmoids, and combinations of polynomial and sigmoidal nonlinearities have shown interesting properties for source separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This paper focuses on second-order polynomial nonlinearities defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> with . An interesting property of the resulting nonlinear model referred to as polynomial PNMM (PPNMM) is that it reduces to the classical LMM for . Thus, we can expect unmixing results at least as good as those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> where Bayesian and LS methods were investigated. Another motivation for using the PPNMM is the Weierstrass approximation theorem, which states that any continuous function defined on a bounded interval can be uniformly approximated by a polynomial with any desired precision <ref type="bibr">[22, p. 15]</ref>. As explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, it is reasonable to consider polynomials with first-and second-order terms (since higher order terms can generally be neglected), which leads to (2). Higher order terms could be considered in the presence of more than two reflections. However, the resulting interaction spectra are, in practice, of low amplitude and are hardly distinguishable from the noise. Straightforward computations allow the PPNMM observation vector (for a given pixel of the image) to be expressed as follows:</p><p>(3) where denotes the Hadamard (term-by-term) product. Note that the resulting PPNMM includes bilinear terms such as those considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, the nonlinear terms are characterized by a single amplitude parameter , leading to a less complex model when compared with the models introduced in [8], <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Note that endmember (contained in ) can be obtained in the noise free case by setting and in (3). Due to physical considerations, the abundance vector satisfy the following positivity and sum-to-one constraints: <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> It is straightforward to show that the function is noninjective for a fixed . However, the unmixing problem is identifiable since the application is injective under specific conditions related to the pure component spectra (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. BAYESIAN ESTIMATION</head><p>This section generalizes the hierarchical Bayesian model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to the PPNMM. The unknown parameter vector associated with the PPNMM contains the pixel abundances [satisfying constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>], the nonlinearity parameter , and the additive noise variance . This section summarizes the likelihood and the parameter priors associated with the proposed hierarchical Bayesian PPNMM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Likelihood</head><p>Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> shows that , , are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean and covariance matrix (denoted as , ,</p><p>). As a consequence, the likelihood function of the observation vector can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where is the standard norm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Parameter Priors</head><p>In order to satisfy the sum-to-one constraint, the abundance vector can be rewritten <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>with and where notation indicates that the th component of has been removed, i.e., . The positivity constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> impose that belongs to the following simplex <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> A uniform prior distribution on is chosen for to reflect the absence of prior knowledge about the abundance vector. A Jeffreys prior is chosen for <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> which also reflects the absence of knowledge for this parameter (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for details). A conjugate Gaussian prior is finally chosen for the nonlinearity parameter , i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> The Gaussian prior is zero mean since the value of can be equally likely positive or negative. Moreover, it favors small values of and is a conjugate prior for parameter , which will simplify the computations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Hyperparameter Prior</head><p>The hyperparameter is also included within the Bayesian model. A conjugate inverse-gamma prior is assigned to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where are fixed to obtain a flat prior, reflecting the absence of knowledge about variance [ will be set to (1, ) in the simulation section].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Posterior Distribution of</head><p>The joint posterior distribution of the unknown parameter vector can be computed using the following hierarchical structure: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where means "proportional to" and is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. By assuming that parameters , , and are a priori independent, the joint prior distribution of the unknown parameter vector can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> The joint posterior distribution can then be computed up to a multiplicative constant, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain closed form expressions of the standard Bayesian estimators [including the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators] associated with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. The last part of this section studies an MCMC method that can be used to generate samples asymptotically distributed according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. These generated samples are then used to compute the MAP or MMSE estimators of the unknown parameter vector .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Metropolis-Within-Gibbs Sampler</head><p>The principle of the Gibbs sampler is to sample according to the conditional distributions of the posterior of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chap. 10]</ref>. The probability density functions (pdf) associated with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> are studied below.</p><p>1) Conditional pdf : Straightforward computations lead to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where . Since it is not easy to sample according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> [mainly because of the indicator function ], we propose to update the abundance using a Metropolis-Hasting move. More precisely, a new abundance coefficient is proposed following a Gaussian random walk procedure (the variance of the proposal distribution has been adjusted to obtain an acceptance rate close to 0.5, as recommended in <ref type="bibr">[26, p. 8]</ref>). The generated abundance is accepted or rejected with an appropriate probability provided in Algorithm 1.</p><p>2) Conditional pdf : Using (5), it can be easily shown that is distributed according to the following Gaussian distribution: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where and . As a consequence, sampling according to ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) is straightforward.</p><p>3) Conditional pdf : Looking carefully at <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, it can be shown that , is distributed according to the following inverse-gamma distribution: <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> from which it is easy to sample.</p><p>4) Conditional pdf : Finally, by looking at the posterior distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, it can be seen that , is distributed according to the following inverse-gamma distribution: <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> The resulting Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler used to sample according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> is summarized in Algorithm 1.</p><p>After generating samples using the procedures defined previously, the MMSE estimator of the unknown parameters can be approximated by computing the empirical averages of these samples, after an appropriate burn-in period. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> Even if the sampling strategy has been observed to converge very fast, its computational complexity can be heavy for practical applications. The next section studies LS estimators, which allow this computational complexity to be significantly reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. LS METHODS</head><p>LS methods have been successfully used for linear SU <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The LS method associated with the observation equation (3) consists of minimizing the following criterion: <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> under the positivity and sum-to-one constraints (4). This optimization problem is not easy to handle mainly because of constraints (4). However, the cost function is quadratic with respect to parameter . As a consequence, by differentiating with respect to , the following closed-form expression for can be obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> After replacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> in , we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> We introduce below two strategies to compute the optimal abundance vector under constraints (4). Note that, once has been computed, the nonlinearity parameter can be estimated as follows:</p><p>(21)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Taylor Approximation</head><p>Motivated by the method introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we propose to approximate function defined in (20) using the first-order terms of a Taylor series expansion. Let denotes the estimated abundance vector estimate at the th iteration, and its corresponding estimated spectrum following <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. The Taylor approximation of at can be written <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> where is the gradient matrix of of size and is the unknown parameter vector to be estimated. The th column of can be derived from (3) as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> where and the partial derivatives of and are available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Approximating in ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) using ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>), vector can be estimated by solving the following constrained LS problem: <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> under constraints (4), where <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> and is the gradient matrix. Problem (24) can be finally solved by the FCLS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. More precisely, the sum-to-one constraint of the abundances is considered by penalizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, leading to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> subject to the nonnegativity constraints for the parameter vector , where controls the impact of the sum-to-one constraint. Procedure ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) is repeated until convergence. The convergence of this iterative procedure to the global minimum of the objective function ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) is difficult to prove because of constraints ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. The next section introduces an alternative subgradient-based algorithm whose convergence (to a local minimum of the associated objective function) is ensured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Subgradient-Based Optimization</head><p>A gradient approach could be used to solve the cost function defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> in the absence of constraints. However, the problem is more complicated when constraints (4) have to be considered. The estimation method studied in this section is based on a subgradient optimization (SO) algorithm <ref type="bibr">[27, p. 339</ref>] that is appropriate for constrained problems. More precisely, subgradient-based optimization allows each abundance to be independently updated. Due to the sum-to-one constraint of the abundance vector, the cost function <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> can be expressed as a function of by setting . In that case, the cost function ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) can be rewritten as <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> where (28) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> At a given point , the SO algorithm performs sequential line searches along directions defined by the partial derivatives with respect to (for ), i.e.,</p><p>where the partial derivatives of are provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Finally, the line search procedure solves the following problem: <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> where is a direction vector of size , and (for ) are upper bounds for the line search parameters. More precisely, upper bounding according to the rule if if if ensures that constraints (4) are satisfied. Problem ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>) can be solved using the golden section method <ref type="bibr">[27, p. 270</ref>]. The abundances are then updated component by component (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for more details about the algorithm). Here again, the procedure is repeated until convergence. The next section presents the performance of the proposed algorithms on synthetic and real hyperspectral images.</p><p>V. SIMULATIONS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Synthetic Data</head><p>The performance of the proposed nonlinear SU algorithms is first evaluated by unmixing four synthetic images of size 50 50 pixels. The endmembers contained in these images have been extracted from the spectral libraries provided with the ENVI software <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (i.e., green grass, olive-green paint, and galvanized steel metal). The first synthetic image has been generated using the standard LMM. A second image has been generated according to the bilinear mixing model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, referred to as "Fan model" (FM). A third image has been generated according to the generalized bilinear mixing model (GBM) presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, whereas a fourth image has been generated according to the PNMM. For each image, the abundance vectors , , have been randomly generated according to a uniform distribution over the admissible set defined by the positivity and sum-to-one constraints. All images have been corrupted by an additive white Gaussian noise of variance , corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio SNR dB. The nonlinearity coefficients are uniformly drawn in the set (0, 1) for the GBM, and parameter has been uniformly generated in the set ( 0.3, 0.3) for the PPNMM. Different estimation procedures have been considered for the four mixing models.</p><p>1) For the LMM, we have considered the standard FCLS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the Bayesian algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>2) The FM has been unmixed using the LS method introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and a Bayesian algorithm similar to the one derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> but assuming all the nonlinearity coefficients are equal to 1.</p><p>3) The unmixing strategies used for the GBM are the three algorithms presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, i.e., a Bayesian algorithm and two LS methods. 4) The Bayesian and LS algorithms presented in Sections III and IV have been used for unmixing the proposed PPNMM. Note that all results presented in this paper have been obtained using the Bayesian MMSE estimator. The quality of the unmixing procedures can be measured by comparing the estimated and actual abundance vector using the root mean square error (RMSE) defined by RMSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> where and are the actual and estimated abundance vectors for the th pixel of the image and is the number of image pixels. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> shows the RMSEs associated with images for the different estimation procedures. Note that the best results (in terms of RMSE) for each image have been represented in underlined bold, whereas the second best results have been depicted in bold. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> shows that the abundances estimated by the Bayesian algorithm and the LS methods are similar for the PPNMM. Moreover, for these four images, the PPNMM seems to be more robust than the other mixing models to deviations from the actual model. Indeed, the PPNMM provides small abundance RMSEs for the four images . The unmixing quality can be also evaluated by the reconstruction error (RE) defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">RE (<label>32</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where is the th observation vector and is its estimate. Table <ref type="table">II</ref> compares the REs obtained for the different synthetic images. These results show that the REs are close for the different unmixing algorithms. Again, the proposed PPNMM seems to be more robust than the other mixing models to deviations from the actual model in terms of RE.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the estimated distributions of for images using the three presented algorithms (i.e., Bayesian, linearization, and subgradient). This figure shows that the algorithms similarly perform for the estimation of the nonlinearity parameter .</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref> shows the execution times of MATLAB implementations on a 1.66-GHz Dual Core of the proposed algorithms for unmixing the proposed images (2500 pixels for each image). The linearization-based algorithm has the lowest computational   cost and also provides accurate estimations. Note that the computational cost of the Bayesian algorithm (which allows prior knowledge to be included in the unmixing procedure) can be prohibitive for larger images and a high number of endmembers. However, the computational cost of the two proposed optimization methods (linearization and gradient based) is very reasonable, which make them very useful for practical applications.</p><p>The next set of simulations analyzes the performance of the proposed nonlinear SU algorithms for different numbers of endmembers by unmixing four synthetic images of 500 pixels. The endmembers contained in these images have been randomly selected from the 14 endmembers extracted by VCA from the full Cuprite scene described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. For each image, the abundance vectors , , have been randomly generated according to a uniform distribution over the admissible set defined by the positivity and sum-to-one constraints. All images have been corrupted by an additive white Gaussian noise corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio SNR dB. The nonlinearity coefficient is uniformly drawn in the set ( 0.3, 0.3). Tables IV and V compare the performance of the three proposed methods in terms of abundance estimation and RE. These results show that the three methods similarly perform in terms of RE. The Bayesian estimators tend to provide more accurate abundance estimations (i.e., smaller RMSEs) for large values of . Indeed, the Taylor and gradient algorithms may be trapped in local minima of the LS criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> for large values of .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Real Data</head><p>The first real image considered in this section is composed of spectral bands and was acquired in 1997 by the airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) over the Cuprite mining site in Nevada. A subimage of size 50 50 pixels has been chosen here to evaluate the proposed unmixing procedures. The scene is mainly composed of muscovite, alunite, and kaolinite, as explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The endmembers extracted by VCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and the nonlinear EEA proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (referred to as "Heylen"), with , are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The endmembers obtained by the two methods have similar shapes. This result confirms the fact that the geometric EEAs (such as VCA) can be used as a first approximation for endmember estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The estimation algorithms presented in Sections III and IV have been applied to each pixel of the scene using the endmembers extracted by the two EEAs. Examples of abundance maps obtained for endmembers estimated using Heylen's method are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for similar results obtained with endmembers estimated by VCA]. The advantage of the PPNMM is that it allows the nonlinearities between the observations and the abundance vectors to be analyzed. For instance, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the estimated maps of for the Cuprite image. These results show that the observations are nonlinearly related to the endmembers (since ). However, the nonlinearity is weak since the estimated values of are close to 0.</p><p>The second real image considered in this section is composed of spectral bands and was acquired in 1997 by the satellite AVIRIS over the Moffett Field, CA. A subimage of size       algorithms are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> (endmembers have been estimated using Heylen's method). They are similar to the abundance maps obtained with estimation algorithms associated with the LMM (available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the estimated maps of for the Moffett image. In the water area, the observations are nonlinearly related to the endmembers (since ). These nonlinearities can be due to the low amplitude of the water spectrum and possible nonlinear bathymetric effects.</p><p>The quality of unmixing is finally evaluated using the REs for both real images. These REs are compared in Table VI with those obtained by assuming other mixing models. The proposed PPNMM provides smaller REs when compared with other models, which is a very encouraging result. Additional results on the full Cuprite scene are available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS</head><p>A Bayesian and two least squares algorithms were presented for nonlinear spectral unmixing of hyperspectral images. These algorithms assumed that the hyperspectral image pixels are related to the endmembers by a polynomial post-nonlinear mixing model. In the Bayesian framework, the constraints related to the unknown parameters were ensured by using appropriate prior distributions. The posterior distribution of the unknown parameter vector was then derived. The corresponding minimum mean square error estimator was approximated from samples generated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Least squares methods were also investigated for unmixing the PPNMM. These methods provided results similar to the Bayesian algorithm with a reduced computational cost, making them very attractive for hyperspectral image unmixing. Results obtained on synthetic and real images illustrated the accuracy of the PPNMM and the performance of the corresponding estimation algorithms. Future works include the study of nonlinear EEAs appropriate for the proposed parametric PPNMM. Deriving nonlinearity detectors based on the proposed parametric PPNMM is also under investigation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
