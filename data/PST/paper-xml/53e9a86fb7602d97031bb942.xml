<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>suppress MUI statistically (except for the ZF option) even with exact channel state information (CSI). In addition to increased complexity that comes with multichannel estimation and multiuser detection, there even exist frequency-selective channels preventing symbol detection no matter what receiver is used (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for illuminating counter-examples).</p><p>To remove MUI deterministically regardless of the underlying multipath channels, several alternatives have been proposed recently. Those include the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> (and generalizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>), where complex exponentials are utilized as information-bearing subcarriers that retain their orthogonality when passing through multipath channels. However, when the channels have nulls (or deep fades) on some subcarriers, the information symbols on those subcarriers will be lost. Therefore, OFDMA-like transceivers require extra diversity (such as frequency hopping or channel coding) to ameliorate fading effects. To guarantee channel-irrespective MUI-free reception and symbol detection, a mutually-orthogonal usercode-receiver (AMOUR) system was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Subsequently, a generalized multi-carrier (GMC) CDMA was developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> that also unifies many existing schemes. However, similar to all multicarrier systems, AMOUR transmissions are not constant-modulus (C-M) in general, even though a special code design exhibits C-M, and will turn out to fall under the system designs developed herein. AMOUR codes are generally complex valued and bandwidth efficiency drops by 50% if real codes are to be designed from complex ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. To maintain C-M at the transmitter and facilitate low-complexity receivers for MUI-free reception, the so-called shift orthogonal codes (which are not only orthogonal to each other but also to their shifted versions) were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, to maintain shift orthogonality, a 50% bandwidth efficiency penalty is paid for both the real and the complex codes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we develop novel MUI-free CDMA transceivers based on a specific block-spreading operation, which can be viewed as (and is implemented by) symbol-spreading followed by chip interleaving. The resulting so-called chip interleaved block spread (CIBS) transceivers are applicable to both uplink and downlink scenarios. Thanks to chip-interleaving and zero padding at the transmitter, mutual orthogonality between different users' codes is preserved even after multipath propagation, which enables deterministic multiuser separation through low-complexity code-matched filtering without loss of maximum likelihood optimality. Consequently, multiuser detection is successfully converted to a set of equivalent single-user equalization problems (Section III). In addition to MUI-free reception, channel-irrespective symbol detection is also guaranteed. Since the only requirement is mutual orthogonality among users' codes, the code design is very flexible and enables fast algorithms at the receiver. By increasing the symbol block size, the proposed system achieves high bandwidth efficiency. Perfectly constant modulus transmissions become available by filling the zero gaps with known symbols. Variants of the proposed transceivers are also developed in Section IV to include cyclic prefixed (CP) transmissions as well as various (redundant or nonredundant) precoded and loaded transmissions. Transforming the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel to an equivalent set of parallel single-input single-output (SISO) channels implies that the receiver can employ various training-based or (semi-) blind channel estimators developed for single user systems (Section V). Simulations are then performed in Section VI and concluding remarks are drawn in Section VII.</p><p>Notation: Bold upper (lower) letters denote matrices (column vectors); and denote transpose and Hermitian transpose, respectively;</p><p>and stand for Kronecker's delta and Kronecker product, respectively.</p><p>for expectation, for integer ceiling; denotes the identity matrix of size ;</p><p>denotes an all-zero (all-one) matrix with size ; and, denotes a FFT matrix with th entry .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODELING</head><p>The block diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> describes a CDMA system model in either uplink or downlink operation, where only one user (the th user out of a maximum users) is shown. Unlike traditional spreading which is performed over a single symbol, we here use block spreading that operates on a block of symbols; block spreading has also been used in, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Specifically, the information stream of the th user is first parsed into blocks<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> of length , and then block spread by a spreading matrix to obtain the output vector . Viewing each column of (the ( )-st column denoted by ) as a separate spreading code for user , the block spreading can be thought of as a multicode transmitter ( codes per user), since we can write the transmitted block as: <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. After parallel to serial (P/S) conversion of , the th user's coded chip sequence is pulse shaped to the corresponding continuous time signal , where is the chip period and is the chip pulse. The th user's transmitted signal propagates through a (possibly unknown) channel and is filtered by the receive filter that is matched to . Let be the convolution of transmit-with receive-filters. With denoting convolution, let be the chip-sampled discrete time equivalent FIR channel corresponding to the th user. The FIR channel of order includes the th user's asynchronism in the form of delay factors as well as transmit-receive filters and frequency-selective multipath effects. With denoting sampled noise, the aggregate received sequence from all users at the chip rate can then be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, we here focus on a practical quasi-synchronous (QS) system in the uplink, where the mobile users attempt to synchronize with the base-station's pilot waveform and have a coarse common timing reference. A good example is the European 3rd Generation mobile communication system based on hybrid TDMA/CDMA (briefly denoted as T-CDMA), where multiple users per cell are allowed to transmit over the same time slot <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Asynchronism among users is thus limited to only a few chip intervals; the maximum asynchronism arises between the nearest and the farthest mobile users within the cell, and can be predetermined from the radius of the cell and the adopted chip interval . With denoting maximum multipath spread, which is found using field measurements from the operational environment, the maximum channel order can be found as ; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for some calculation examples with real channels.</p><p>The downlink model (from the base station to the user of interest</p><p>) is subsumed by the uplink (1): indeed, setting , is a special case of (1) since the latter allows for distinct user channels. The downlink transmissions are synchronous with , and the maximum channel order depends only on through . In either uplink or downlink transmissions, the only channel knowledge<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> assumed at the transmitter is , and we always choose block size . The linear multiuser separating front-end for user is described by the matrix . Extracting the th user of interest from yields the MUI-free block</p><p>(2)</p><p>The MUI-free output is then equalized by any single user equalizer, e.g., a linear equalizer will yield symbol block estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> Starting from the general block spreading system model described by ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), we will propose next judiciously designed transceiver pairs that enable separation of superimposed multiuser signals deterministically and guarantee detection of each user's symbols regardless of multipath propagation through FIR frequency-selective channels of maximum order .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CIBS-CDMA TRANSCEIVER DESIGN</head><p>To design transceiver pairs , we start by assigning to each user a distinct short signature vector of length denoted by . These vectors are selected to be mutually orthogonal which can be formally stated as a design constraint: d1) select code-generating vectors:</p><p>. Based on the orthogonal signature vectors , we next specify the block spreading matrix and the user-separating matrix . Consider the matrix that we term zero-padding (ZP) matrix because, upon premultiplication with a vector, it appends zeros. Based on , we select our user code matrices and correspondingly the separating matrices as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where, using the Kronecker product definition, we have block length . In our subsequent derivations, we re-peatedly use the following two identities of Kronecker products applied to matrices with matching dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(5)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Using ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">6</ref>), we infer that under d1) the transceiver design of (4) ensures mutual orthogonality among users: and . For the defined in (4), the serial transmission of our th transmitted block is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (upper part). Notice that this novel transmission of symbols over chip periods uses the same block to "spread each chip" of the code. In contrast, in a conventional direct-sequence (DS) CDMA transmission of symbols (see the lower part of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), each symbol is spread by a short code of length over a total of chip periods. The received samples are serial to parallel converted to form vectors:</p><p>. Define the corresponding noise vector ; let be the lower triangular Toeplitz matrix with first column , and be the upper triangular Toeplitz matrix with first row . The channel input-output block relationship of our system can be described in matrix-vector form as <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> (7</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where the second term in the sum accounts for the so-called inter block interference (IBI). On the other hand, our proposed block-spread transmission can be viewed as a symbol-spread transmission (each symbol is spread by the short signature code ) followed by a chip interleaver with guards as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. DS-CDMA corresponds to transmitting the interleaver entries row-wise, while our proposed transmitter outputs the interleaver entries column-wise. This not only explains the acronym chip-interleaved block-spread CDMA (CIBS-CDMA), but also highlights how readily implementable (and backward-compatible) the proposed system is by simply cascading to an existing DS-CDMA system a chip interleaver with guards. Notice that, when and , it simply reverts to a conventional DS-CDMA system. A chip interleaved transmission has also been advocated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, the choice in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> does not lead to the low-complexity MUI-free reception and symbol detection guarantees that this paper will turn out to possess regardless of multipath. Instrumental to these important multipath-transparent properties are the guard times of length (see the top of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). They introduce redundancy that can be made arbitrarily negligible if one increases the block size .</p><p>Because the last rows of the matrix are zero, the IBI is eliminated since</p><p>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the equivalent block-spreading matrix after multipath propagation becomes for the symbol block . Even though is designed at the transmitter to be orthogonal among users, the convolutive channel will generally destroy this orthogonality and give rise MUI. We next show that the design in (4) preserves the code orthogonality among users even after unknown multipath propagation. Multiuser signals can then be separated deterministically using the receive matrix in (4), which depends only on the desired user's signature code.</p><p>Let be the lower triangular Toeplitz matrix with first column the upper triangular Toeplitz matrix with first row , and an shift matrix which is defined as the lower triangular Toeplitz matrix with first column . We can then split the matrix into smaller blocks and rewrite it as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> Applying ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">6</ref>) and using the fact that , we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> We infer from (9) that the code orthogonality among users is preserved since lies in the range space of and is thus orthogonal to for any . In other words, we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Therefore, using <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, we can express (2) as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> shows how the superposition of received signals from multiple users can be separated deterministically regardless of the unknown FIR multipath channels.</p><p>To better understand how the code orthogonality is preserved at the receiver even after frequency-selective filtering, let us divide (and similarly ) into subblocks of size . For each , we can then express the subblock as [cf. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)] ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)</p><p>where, thanks to ZP, inter sub-block interference is avoided. Thus, the th subblock depends only on the th chip of each user's spreading code , while the adjacent chips from each spreading code do not interfere with each other. Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, the received block in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> As a result, multipath channels with CIBS transmissions cause inter symbol interference (ISI) within each symbol block, which is denoted by in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), but they do not give rise to ICI within the code vector , i.e., we have replaced ICI by ISI, which maintains the orthogonality among spreading codes at the receiver even after frequency-selective propagation, and enables multiuser separation as confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Replacing ICI by ISI also corroborates our previous discussion [following <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>] that the roles of and are interchanged when one compares symbol spreading (bottom of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) with block spreading (top of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Multiplying with amounts to passing through a de-interleaver (that is common to all users) and processing the output with a single-user de-spreading filter matched to in order to obtain the symbols of each mobile unit (here ) with ISI corresponding to its own channel. The transceiver for each user is demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, which consists of symbol spreading (by the short signature code</p><p>) and interleaving at the transmitter, together with de-interleaving and matched filtering (matched to ) at the receiver. Notice that the code-matching user-separating front-end , that provides sufficient statistics for user , is para-unitary. Collecting 's to form</p><p>, we obtain a unitary matrix:</p><p>. Therefore, if is white, then remains white and thus multiuser separation with in (11) preserves the maximum likelihood (ML) optimality, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where denotes conditional probability. Therefore, relying on (de-)interleaving and matched filtering operations only [cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>], we have successfully converted a multiuser detection problem, that has to deal with both MUI and ISI due to time-dispersive channels, into a set of equivalent single-user equalization problems without loss of optimality. After MUI elimination, any single-user equalizer can be applied to of ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) to remove the residual ISI. Since the tall Toeplitz matrix of size has always full rank regardless of the channel zero locations, the symbol block is guaranteed to be detectable in the absence of noise, which is not the case in conventional DS-CDMA systems since signals from different users may cancel each other for some channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Trading off performance with complexity, we next discuss possible equalization options.</p><p>First, notice that expresses nothing but a linear convolution between the symbol vector and the channel vector ; hence, the maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is directly applicable. Since includes a delay factor that accounts for asynchronism between users, it has at most nonzero taps coming from multipath propagation, where denotes the multipath spread of the th user's channel. For constellations of size , the complexity of MLSE, using Viterbi's algorithm, reduces to per symbol block or per symbol. Thus, the decoding complexity per symbol only depends on the constellation size and the effective channel order , and is irrespective of the block length and the maximum channel order . Therefore, optimal MLSE demodulation becomes feasible for channels with small multipath spread; the value of is obtained at the receiver following channel estimation.</p><p>When is large preventing the usage of MLSE, we resort to linear equalization for moderate block size . Defining for notational brevity, we can adopt the linear ZF equalizer given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> to eliminate ISI at the price of noise enhancement. Taking into account the noise explicitly, the linear MMSE equalizer can be also used. In block (matrix) form, it is expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where we have assumed that and (extension to colored noise is straight-forward). Inverting a general matrix incurs complexity . However, by exploiting the fact that in (15) and in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) are Hermitian positive definite Toeplitz matrices, the complexity required for their computation and inversion is reduced to <ref type="bibr">[13, p. 197</ref>] Therefore, the overall linear equalization by ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) or ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) incurs complexity . When the channel order and thus the block size increase to render even the linear equalizers of ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) complex, we recommend using a low-complexity frequency domain equalization which takes advantage of the Toeplitz structure of , as we detail next (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>). Let denote the first columns of and define the matrix . Notice that post-multiplying by a vector maps it to a vector by overlapping-and-adding the last elements to its first elements (matrix implementation of the overlap-add operation in block convolution). Thus, we can always convert the Toeplitz matrix into a circulant one through as follows:</p><p>. Because (I)FFT's diagonalize circulant matrices, the circulant matrix can be decomposed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for details) as , where is a diagonal matrix with st diagonal entry: . Therefore, we can design our low-complexity (LC) equalizer <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> for user as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> Matrix equalizes the channel in the frequency domain and its complexity no longer depends on the channel order as opposed to conventional time-domain equalizers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Since in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> includes only two fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations and a diagonal matrix inversion, it has low complexity of order per symbol block. However, symbol detection is not guaranteed since there exist channels that have nulls located at , such that (and hence ) loses rank and becomes noninvertible.</p><p>Two important remarks are now in order. Remark 1 (ISI Versus MUI): CIBS-CDMA replaces ICI by ISI, and thereby converts a multiuser detection problem into a set of equivalent single-user equalization problems. It is thus of interest to compare it with conventional multiuser detectionbased approaches.</p><p>A) Performance and Complexity: The performance and complexity depend on the specific choice of the equalizer and the multiuser detector, which in turn are related to the operating system parameters. While general comparisons on these issues are difficult without detailed system specifications, we refer the reader to a particular comparison example carried out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> between the MUI-free transceiver of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the linear multiuser detector of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, both utilizing blind subspace-based channel estimation and ZF equalization.</p><p>B) Flexibility and Robustness: Notice that equalization among users in CIBS-CDMA is fully uncoordinated, and each user may choose an equalizer depending on her/his own computational capability, without interfering with other users. This is in sharp contrast with joint (and thus fully coordinated) multiuser detectors. The fundamental distinction originates from the different multiple access philosophies: conventional DS-CDMA schemes allow for fully uncoordinated transmissions but pay off in coordinated joint multiuser detection; while MUI-free transceivers, including the proposed one and those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, rely on minimally coordinated transmissions to achieve uncoordinated detection. We believe that this uncoordinated detection capability favors MUI-free transceivers because it enhances their robustness to imperfect system parameters, e.g., imperfect channel estimates and unbalanced power control <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>; intuitively speaking, poor channel estimation accuracy from one user does not affect other users' performance. However, thorough investigation of these issues goes beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Remark 2 (Delay Control Versus Power Control): As mobile users are distributed, the power received from each user may have a large dynamic range, which necessitates stringent power control for multiuser detection. However, power control requirements are alleviated in CIBS-CDMA since the received signals from multiple users are separable by design. The key parameter, however, in the CIBS-CDMA is the maximum channel order . Large implies large to achieve high bandwidth efficiency (see discussions later on in Section III-A), which increases decoding complexity and decoding delay. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> It is thus favorable to keep as small as possible. As we have discussed earlier, depends on and . Notice that is determined by the operating environment and is thus not up to the designer's control. To maintain a small channel order , we may rely on delay control to decrease . In this case, each mobile user synchronizes with the base station's pilot waveform and roughly calculates the distance from the base station by, e.g., power measurements. In the reverse link, the mobile advances its transmissions by a corresponding amount to compensate for the two-way propagation time that is consumed between the base station and the mobile user. With such a delay control mechanism, the maximum could be considerably reduced. We next compare the proposed transceiver design with those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> that also achieve deterministic MUI elimination and guarantee symbol detectability; actually, they arrive at the same output (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> with <ref type="bibr">[11, eq. (19)</ref>] and [16, eq. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)]. Our first metric for comparison will be bandwidth efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Bandwidth Efficiency</head><p>Within each received block in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, information symbols are transmitted per user. The bandwidth efficiency for users can thus be calculated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Note that the bandwidth efficiency for the AMOUR system in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is:</p><p>.

Suppose the system is allocated bandwidth and the information rate is . The spreading gain is thus . For AWGN channels, the maximum number of users that do not interfere with each other is when employing either TDMA, FDMA, or CDMA. In our system (and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>), the spreading gain is and thus, the maximum number of MUI-free users is <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> the maximum number is , and is restricted to be a power of 2.</p><p>To illustrate the difference between our system and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, we compare in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> the corresponding bandwidth efficiencies for channels of maximum order (2-rays) and (4-rays) with varying from 1 to 16. Setting the channel coherence time, so that the channels we consider are time-invariant within each block. Therefore, the present version of our system is not applicable to fast fading channels. For slowly fading channels, the coherence time might also limit the maximum value of K, which in turn determines the highest possible bandwidth efficiency. spreading gain to , Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the maximum number of MUI-free users that are allowed. Certainly, with increasing , our system can accommodate many more users than can <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Complexity and Design Flexibility</head><p>In this subsection, we will compare the computational complexity among the three different MUI-resilient transceivers: this paper's and those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. First, we note that all three transceivers arrive at the same single user block model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>; hence, the complexity of blind channel estimators and equalizers is identical. The main difference lies in the multiuser separating front-end matrices . For this reason, we only concentrate on the complexity differences among the three front-ends.</p><p>For each user in CIBS-CDMA, the front-end amounts to inner products between vectors. Since each correlator of length requires multiplies and adds, its complexity is . So the complexity per user is , and the overall complexity for all users (e.g., at the base station (BS) where we need to demodulate all users' information) is . With users in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the shift-orthogonal codes have length , and consequently each receiver needs inner products between vectors after discarding 1 cyclic prefix. Therefore, each user in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> [16] has complexity of order , and the overall complexity for users will be . Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, where only a special class of codes with 50% bandwidth efficiency is constructed, and different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, where highly efficient codes are generally complex, the design herein is very flexible because the only requirement on our spreading codes is their mutual orthogonality. Since the design of orthogonal codes has been well developed in the literature (at least for multipath-free propagation), there are many fast algorithms available. Using such algorithms, the complexity of our transceivers can be lowered even further. For example, we can adopt inverse FFT (IFFT) or Walsh-Hadamard (W-H) codes for the code-generating vector in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Then, at the BS, Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The maximum number of users allowed.</p><p>we can apply FFT or Fast Walsh Transform (FWT) to separate users. If the FFT is employed, the complexity for all users is , while the FWT is even faster than the FFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Recall though that W-H codes with length exist only if is an integer <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. But, even if we constrain our codes to be W-H, the requirement on the code length of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is more restrictive since is required to be a power of 2. For each user in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the front-end consists of inner products between the received block and different Vandermonde vectors. So, the complexity per user is , while the overall complexity for users will be . Note that AMOUR codes can also be constructed based on FFTs to reduce computational complexity. If are columns of the FFT matrix, the front-end for all users amounts to a -point FFT and AMOUR's complexity reduces to . The simplest AMOUR code was proposed in [27, eq. ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>)] and can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> where is the th column of the FFT matrix. Since the code set satisfies d1), it is subsumed in our code designs herein; hence, the resulting receiver has complexity . For clarity, we summarize complexity requirements and comparisons with <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. If the system has more than active users, it is better to use fast algorithms rather than separate correlators at the BS. With the same number of users, we infer from Table I that our system has less complexity than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and the difference becomes more pronounced if special codes (e.g., W-H or FFT) are employed. Fast algorithms for the codes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> have not been reported.</p><p>Another remark here is that if we apply the equalizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, which requires only two FFTs, low-complexity MUI and ISI elimination per user becomes possible provided that the channel can also be obtained with low-complexity methods (e.g., via training, or, with the finite-alphabet based algorithm outlined in Section V-B). If channel estimation is complex or if the channel is varying fast and CSI needs to be updated frequently, the complexity of the multiuser separating front-end is less critical for the overall receiver design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Perfectly Constant Modulus Uplink Transmissions</head><p>A well-known drawback of multicarrier systems is that the transmitted signal is not of constant modulus, which imposes restrictions on the system hardware design and undesirable back-offs in the high-power amplifier (HPA). Note that the uplink transmissions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> have constant modulus, while our system and the FFT-based designs of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> have constant modulus except for the guard zeros. Although not a problem for the HPA, usage of guard zeros may cause on/off implementation problems in analog system designs. However, with a digital signal processing (DSP) unit and a digital-to-analog converter (D/A) at the transmitter, inserting zeros is not a problem for, e.g., software radio systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Nevertheless, as we detail next, the proposed transmitter can also dispense with zero padding and achieve perfectly constant modulus transmissions during its uplink operation.</p><p>With the code design in (4), the transmitted block has zero subblocks of length evenly distributed across each block. To make up for perfectly constant modulus, we fill in the zero gaps using nonzero vectors with entries drawn from the same constellation as , that is, we modify the transmitter as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> In this case, the modified transmitted block has perfectly constant modulus across the block. We next show that these filling vectors do not change our receiver design provided that the codes are selected to have zero mean.</p><p>With the modified block in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, and the original received vector in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the new received vector can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> Thus, our task is to show that , which is equivalent to verifying that <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> Note that can be expressed as , where denotes the st power of , which has only one unit entry at the top-right corner, and zeros elsewhere.</p><p>Introducing the matrix that performs a cyclic shift on a vector, and using the block-expression of in ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), we then obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> With the receive matrix designed as in ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and with inserted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, we arrive at <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> where the identity was used in establishing the second equality.</p><p>Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> leads to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> if in addition to d1) we adopt the design constraint of: d2) balanced user codes; i.e., . Note that d2) is not very restrictive and can be satisfied by many code designs. For instance, IFFT or W-H codes satisfy d2) after discarding only the code with all one entries. The maximum number of users is thus only decreased by one. Recall however that with the filling symbols in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, we achieve a perfectly constant modulus transmission while maintaining its low-complexity MUI/ISI-resilient reception and its high bandwidth efficiency regardless of frequency-selective multipath.</p><p>The penalty with nonzero guards is a small power loss since we allocate percent of the transmit-power to the filling symbols. However, if , the power loss is small. Furthermore, the power loss can be reduced further since the transmitters do not need to pick the same amplitude for the filling symbols as for the data symbols. If the amplitude of the filling symbols is reduced by half, the power loss decreases to one fourth of the original one. The extreme case is to insert filling symbols with zero amplitude as in (4), which incurs no power loss. Note that the filling symbols can be designed to have arbitrary shape to facilitate analog hardware implementation. Furthermore, being known to the receiver, the filling symbols can also be utilized for possible synchronization, or channel estimation purposes, e.g., by following the approaches in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, these topics go beyond the scope of this paper and will not be discussed here. In the next section, we will introduce variants of the proposed transceiver, which do not insert zeros at the transmitter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXTENSIONS</head><p>Motivated by the possibility of using either CP or ZP in single-user OFDM systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we can also employ CP-based multiuser transmissions to obtain block-spread transmissions with perfectly constant modulus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Cyclic Prefixed Transmissions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Let</head><p>denote the matrix formed by the last rows of and define the transmit-matrix that inserts the CP, and the receive-matrix that discards the CP. We can then replace the ZP transceiver in ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> Because the first columns of are zero, the IBI is removed since . Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and with , we can readily verify by direct substitution that <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> The output of our multiuser separating front-end then becomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> shows that is MUI-free, which enables application of any single-user equalizer. Because the equivalent channel matrix is circulant, each single-user receiver can employ the low-complexity matrix equalizer as in ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> The advantage of CP over ZP is that the CP transmitter achieves perfect constant modulus in the uplink. However, the price paid is possible performance loss <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> because the circulant matrix could lose rank if the channel has nulls located at for . If is noninvertible (or ill-conditioned), the symbols cannot be recovered. Therefore, unlike ZP where the Toeplitz matrix is always full rank, detection of user symbols is not guaranteed with CP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Precoding or Error-Control Coding for CP Transmissions</head><p>To guarantee symbol detection with our CP transceivers, we can employ redundant precoding or error-control (channel) coding at the expense of some information rate loss. In other words, instead of transmitting the data vector , we can transmit a vector with . Vector could denote a channel encoded sequence (with, e.g., block or convolutional coding), or, a linearly precoded block obtained by premultiplying with a tall matrix with entries from the complex field. For linear precoding, the transmitted th block is now , and the receiver output in (30) becomes (32) Note that the diagonal matrix has at most zeros since all channels have maximum order . Therefore, if and the precoder is chosen so that any rows of are linearly independent, then the matrix will have full column rank and the detection of will be guaranteed (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for a similar argument and choices of precoding matrices). To assure symbol detectability, only a slight loss in bandwidth efficiency is incurred. The latter now becomes . However, bandwidth efficiency can be regained by increasing and at the expense of a slight increase in decoding complexity and decoding delay. Note also that the constant modulus is generally not assured with linear precoding, although we avoid transmitting zeros within blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Loading ZP or CP Transmissions</head><p>The equalizers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> for ZP and (31) for CP entail two FFTs at the receiver. As with single-user OFDM systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, one FFT operation can be moved to the transmitter, which amounts to linear precoding with the IFFT matrix as follows:</p><p>(33) where now denotes the transmitted block. Then, easy frequency-domain equalization can be accomplished with one FFT and scalar division at the receiver. By using nonredundant IFFT precoding at the transmitter, the frequency-selective channel for each user is further converted to parallel flat-faded subchannels as in single-user OFDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Therefore, power and bit loading can be applied across subchannels for each user, exactly as with discrete multiple tone (DMT) modulation (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). That is, we can replace (33) by <ref type="bibr">(34)</ref> where is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries allocating power across the single user subchannels.</p><p>More generally, we can precode with no redundancy the information block by any full rank matrix (let us denote it by here) . Under several criteria, the optimal loading matrices for ZP transceivers were developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Therefore, with the low-complexity multiuser separating front-end, we recognize that schemes developed for single-user systems can be applied directly to multiuser scenarios.</p><p>The redundant precoding in Section IV-B and the nonredundant loading of this section will again lead to nonconstant modulus transmissions. However, since the precoding and loading are performed over blocks of length , the peak to average ratio (PAR) depends on the size of , rather than , which is the case in AMOUR <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Since , the nonlinear effects are thus expected to be less severe here even with precoding or loading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CHANNEL ESTIMATION ISSUES</head><p>To demodulate user information, we need to acquire CSI at the receiver that is required by either linear or nonlinear equalizers [cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>]. Since multiuser transmissions are converted to parallel single-user transmissions, blind or nonblind channel estimation methods developed for single-user transmissions can be applied directly. Next, we summarize briefly the available schemes for the options described in Sections III and IV.</p><p>Certainly, training-based CSI acquisition is one candidate. Note that, unlike the traditional multiuser setup, the training sequences for all users do not need to be designed jointly. However, training sequences consume bandwidth especially when the underlying channel is varying and frequent re-training is required. (Semi-) blind channel estimators attract growing interest for such cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Subspace-Based Channel Estimation</head><p>Based on the data model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> for ZP transmissions, the subspace-based method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is an option that guarantees channel identifiability regardless of the FIR channel zero locations. Correspondingly, for the CP transceiver in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, the subspace-based channel estimation developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> can be utilized. In this case, however, each channel is identifiable provided that its roots are not on (or close to) the FFT grid:</p><p>. When the CP transceiver is equipped with precoding as in (32), the blind subspace method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is preferable, because it is also proven to guarantee channel identifiability if is chosen to satisfy with any rows of designed to be linearly independent.</p><p>Because subspace-based methods capitalize only on data structure information, they are appropriate for any signal constellation. They can still be applied to the systems with nonredundant precoding (and loading) that we described in Section IV-C. The drawbacks of subspace-based approaches are: i) they require many data blocks, which assumes that the channel is varying sufficiently slow, and ii) when is large, their complexity increases since they involve singular value decomposition (SVD). However, if the appropriate precoding matrix is applied, low-complexity channel estimators become possible as we discuss next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. (Semi-) Blind Finite-Alphabet-Based Channel Estimation</head><p>If the FFT precoder of (33) [or (34)] is applied, we arrive at a single-user OFDM transmission model for each user. All methods that have been developed for single-user OFDM can thus be applied here including the subspace-based approaches of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Based on the finite alphabet (FA) property of the source symbols, a new low-complexity channel estimator method was proposed recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which guarantees channel identifiability regardless of channel zeros if one selects for BPSK, or, for QPSK and QAM signals. Furthermore, the FA-based approach can estimate the channel with only one block for PSK constellations, which implies that it can track faster channel variations than the subspace-based approaches. If used together with training sequences at the beginning of the data transmission, the semi-blind adaptive implementation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> can track slow channel variations with high accuracy and surprisingly low complexity. Therefore, with FA-based channel estimation, the overall multiuser receiver has very low complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND SIMULATIONS</head><p>Since the signals from multiple users are separated at the receiver, we can analyze the performance for each user separately. If the ZF equalizer in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> is employed, theoretical BER evaluation becomes possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For simplicity, we here focus only on BPSK signals. Assuming that the noise in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is white with zero mean and variance , the noise block in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> has correlation matrix thanks to the orthogonality between the columns of . Let us denote the th column of the ZF equalizer of (15) as . With standing for the bit SNR, the average BER for user is thus (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(35)</ref> where is the Euclidean norm of a vector and denotes the -function. Note that the BER in (35) is channel-dependent. In the following test cases, we will look at the average BER over 5 000 Monte Carlo channel realizations where the FIR channels are randomly generated with each tap being Rayleigh distributed.</p><p>Test Case 1 (Comparison With Multiuser Detectors): To compare the proposed CIBS transceivers with symbol-spread multiuser detectors, we simulate both direct sequence (DS) CDMA and multi-carrier (MC) CDMA systems. The system spreading gain is and the channels have maximum order (4-rays). The DS-CDMA users spread their information symbols with W-H spreading codes of length and insert 3 zeros between blocks to avoid IBI/ISI. The MC-CDMA users adopt OFDM with CP of length 3 after spreading their information symbols with W-H codes of length 16. When only the channel of the desired user is available, the single-user RAKE receiver can be employed. The corresponding BER curve levels off and a high error floor appears due to the MUI, resulting a poor performance far from that of single user case <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>. To remove MUI, we also simulated ZF and MMSE<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> multiuser detectors for both DS-CDMA and MC-CDMA, which require knowledge of the codes and the channels of all users at the receiver-end. For the proposed transceiver, we simulated two scenarios. The first uses to accommodate users [cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>]. The second adopts , which enables MUI-free reception of users. Increasing the block size allows for more MUI-free users [cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>]; however, the BER performance per user degrades as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> (it will be further elaborated in Test Case 2). Thanks to the MUI-free reception, the BER remains unchanged when the number of active users varies. However, for both DS-CDMA and MC-CDMA, when the number of active users increases, the performance of each user degrades, as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(a)-(d</ref>). When the system is lightly loaded, i.e., , the multiuser detectors could exhibit better performance since MUI is less severe in this case. When the system is moderately or heavily loaded, e.g., , the proposed MUI-free transceiver outperforms the multiuser-detectors as confirmed by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>.</p><p>Test Case 2 (Comparison With the MUI-Free Transceiver of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>): To compare the proposed transceiver with those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, we here adopt ZF equalizers and the design parameters of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for its shift-orthogonal transceiver:</p><p>(4-ray channels), and users. The code length (spreading gain) for each user is then to satisfy the shift-orthogonality between user codes; the block length is thus . Note that increasing does not bring additional benefits to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, while system decoding complexity and delays increase. However, is very flexible in our system design and different tradeoffs can be exploited between decoding complexity/delay, BER performance, and bandwidth efficiency, which is determined by the maximum number of MUI-free users and the information rate of each user. To make a fair comparison, we put both transceivers with the same information rate under the same system bandwidth , and thus the same spreading gain</p><p>. Various system designs can be afforded by the proposed transceiver as detailed in the following.</p><p>1) We fix our system to have the same decoding delay by adopting . Therefore, we can afford users [cf. ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>)], and the block length becomes . Since and , our system accommodates one more user with shorter blocks, which implies that our system has higher bandwidth efficiency than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>: . However, since both systems reach the same block model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, each user has the same performance as confirmed by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> with . The only difference here is that the system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> incurs a small power loss dB due to the cyclic prefix of length 1 (out of ) that is discarded at the receiver. Notice that additional power loss will occur in the proposed CIBS-CDMA if we fill the zero guards with known symbols to make up for perfect constant modulus.</p><p>2) As confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, the number of users increases for fixed when increases. For example, with we allow for 11, 12, 14 MUI-free users within a block of length , respectively. For FIR channels of maximum order , a total of users are allowed when . In addition to larger decoding complexity/delays, the BER performance degrades, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, as the maximum number of users increases.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Clearly, we see the trade-offs emerging among bandwidth efficiency, decoding complexity/delays and BER performance. We can also infer from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> that increasing in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> degrades system performance because it reaches the same model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. However, the bandwidth efficiency does not improve with , and is always limited to %. 3) We now fix the number of users to . Then the block length should be chosen to satisfy: , which requires . Note that with , we can always choose the minimum since . Therefore, we can set here and , which results in smaller decoding complexity/delays and leads to better BER performance, which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> with . On the other hand, we can increase the number of symbols within each data vector to increase throughput for a fixed number of users. For example, with a block length , we can allow for symbols for each of the users. However, when and hence the symbol rate per user increases, the BER performance degrades, which can be confirmed by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. The reason is that when increases, the spreading gain per symbol decreases:</p><p>, and thus the system resources are not fully utilized. To fully exploit the system bandwidth resources , we can for example transmit the linearly precoded or channel coded vector (e.g., as in (32)) instead of the data vector . For example, within the spreading gain , we can set or for linear precoding or adopt channel coding with rate or to improve the BER performance. To illustrate this point, a simple simulation is provided next.</p><p>4) We here simulate users in both systems. Since should be a power of 2 and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the code length is again . Here, with the same , and , we use and a Hamming code to improve the BER performance, as confirmed by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> where the coded BER is calculated through <ref type="bibr">[3, eqs. (10.67</ref>) and (10.101)]. We could also compare the coded transmissions for both systems. However, to maintain the same bandwidth effi- ciency, we need to adopt codes with different rates. Since low rate codes have stronger error-control capability, the comparison results would also favor the proposed CIBS-CDMA. For this reason, we just construct a simple artificial case here with Hamming codes to illustrate the point.</p><p>Test Case 3 (Comparison of (Semi-) Blind Channel Estimators): To test the blind channel estimators outlined in Section V, we here simulate a system having parameters: , and equipped with ZF equalizers. However, to provide a very low-complexity channel estimator based on the FA property of the source symbols (cf. Section V-B), we also precode our transmission with a -point IFFT as in (33) and choose to initialize the FA-based estimator with one training block. As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the minimum number of data blocks needed to perform the subspace based method is . When only 15 blocks are collected, the FA-based channel estimator outperforms the subspace based alternative considerably as verified by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>, which also corroborates the fast convergence of the FA-based method. When more blocks become available, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> illustrates that subspace based methods can also approach the benchmark theoretical performance of (35) with known channels. As mentioned in Section V and confirmed by Figs. 10 and 11, the drawback of subspace based methods is their slow convergence and high computational complexity. On the positive side, the subspace based method is constellation-independent, and thus it can be applied to any of the nonredundant precoded and loaded transmissions that we discussed in Section IV-C. In contrast, the FA-based channel estimator is tailored to the FFT precoded transmission in (33), to offer fast convergence and low complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>A novel MUI-free CDMA transceiver was developed in this paper for frequency-selective multipath channels. Relying on chip (de-)interleaving and matched filtering operations only, a multiuser detection problem was converted into a set of equivalent single-user equalization problems without loss of ML optimality. In addition to MUI-free reception, symbols were also  guaranteed to be detectable regardless of channel zero locations. By increasing the symbol block size, the proposed system achieves high bandwidth efficiency, and by filling the zero gaps with known symbols enables transmissions with perfectly constant modulus. Variants were also developed to include cyclic prefixed transmissions, and various redundant as well as nonredundant precoding alternatives. Separating the superposition of multiuser transmissions through frequency-selective multipath enabled application of single-user (semi-) blind channel estimation and equalization algorithms for intersymbol interference mitigation. Simulation results corroborated the improved performance relative to competing alternatives.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
