<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was created on the basis of expert opinion and has now become accepted as the 'standard' object-oriented modelling notation. Our objectives were to determine how widely the notations of the UML, and their usefulness, have been studied empirically, and to identify which aspects of it have been studied in most detail. We undertook a mapping study of the literature to identify relevant empirical studies and to classify them in terms of the aspects of the UML that they studied. We then conducted a systematic literature review, covering empirical studies published up to the end of 2008, based on the main categories identified. We identified 49 relevant publications, and report the aggregated results for those categories for which we had enough papers-metrics, comprehension, model quality, methods and tools and adoption. Despite indications that a number of problems exist with UML models, researchers tend to use the UML as a 'given' and seem reluctant to ask questions that might help to make it more effective.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The evidence-based paradigm is employed widely in clinical medicine and other disciplines, such as education, as a tool for supporting both practice and policy-making. The core concept underpinning this is one of performing a secondary study that systematically finds, assesses and aggregates the results from a set of (primary) empirical studies, in order to assemble the best available evidence for answering a research question in as unbiased a manner as possible. The idea of adapting it for use in software engineering was first proposed in 2004 by Kitchenham et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and since then it has become increasingly accepted as a useful addition to the methodological toolset used for empirical software engineering.</p><p>The Systematic Literature Review, or SLR, provides a key instrument for undertaking evidencebased research. However, the comprehensive form of a full SLR is really intended for addressing a quite specific research question, and its use is dependent upon the availability of a suitable set of primary studies ‡ . Hence, as a preliminary step to undertaking such a review, it is sometimes appropriate to perform a Mapping Study, sometimes termed a 'Scoping Review'. A mapping study addresses a much broader research question, and has the goal of identifying the extent and quality of the available primary evidence in order to determine where there are 'clusters' of studies that could support a fuller review. Performing a mapping study 'involves a search of the literature to determine what sorts of studies addressing the systematic review question have been carried out, where they are published, in what databases they have been indexed, and what sort of outcomes they have assessed, and in what populations' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The original 2004 guidelines for performing such studies in software engineering were updated in 2007, based upon an expanding experience base <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Since 2004 we have identified over 50 published papers that describe secondary studies-with these reporting both complete SLRs as well as Mapping Studies. Our first systematic review of these (a tertiary study), with a restricted search and covering secondary studies published up to the end of 2007, identified 20 studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A subsequent widening of the search found another 14, of which 9 were mapping studies; and an update addressing papers published up until the end of 2008 has added another 19 studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, with new studies continuing to be published.</p><p>This paper reports on an SLR that examines the available empirical evidence about the Unified Modeling Language (the UML). Since its introduction in 1994, this has become a de facto 'standard' for describing object-oriented design models, supported by a range of software tools and textbooks. Developed from the unification of three schools of thinking about object-oriented design, it is now managed by the Object Management Group (OMG) § . However, like many software engineering standards, its development appears to have been guided more by expert opinion rather than by using empirically based evidence or well-formed cognitive models, leading to questions about the effectiveness of its relatively complicated structure and notations.</p><p>Indeed, a recent paper seeking to derive a set of principles for designing cognitively effective visual notations for software engineering observes that few design notations used in software engineering have any design rationale <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In particular, the author comments that: '[the] UML does not provide design rationale for any of its graphical conventions', and that: 'some older (even obsolete) visual notations such as DFDs are better designed than more recent ones'.</p><p>This study was not motivated by such well-formed ideas, but rather arose from a concern that students (and others) were apt to find the UML difficult to use as well as encountering problems with understanding ideas that were expressed using the UML. As a first step towards understanding the reasons for this, early in 2008, as part of an advanced undergraduate project, one of us (RP) undertook a mapping study to investigate the scope and scale of studies about the UML itself. The aim of this was to determine the extent to which the forms and characteristics of the UML have been studied empirically, and hence what was known about them <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Thus this set out to 'map' the extent, form and focus of the empirical knowledge about the UML and its use, by seeking to answer the following research questions:</p><p>• How many papers have reported on empirical evaluations on the models and forms used in the UML? • Which aspects of the UML have been most subjected to empirical study? • Which aspects of the UML could be recommended as topics for further empirical study?</p><p>• Which research methods are most frequently employed in empirical studies of the UML?</p><p>Although we discussed some answers to these questions in our preliminary report <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the analysis that we provided there was confined to identifying the extent and form of the literature, with both selection and classification being based upon the titles and abstracts of the papers that we found. However, the results from this were sufficiently encouraging for us to extend the original study into an SLR. For this paper, we have both extended our search to include papers published up to the end of 2008, and, for the categories that had sufficient material, we have also analysed the relevant studies in detail. Hence we are now able to make a more extensive assessment of the available knowledge about the effectiveness of the UML, as determined by empirical studies.</p><p>In the remainder of this paper we first discuss the process that we followed in conducting the SLR, and then outline the outcomes in terms of the number of papers found for each of the categories we adopted. For five of the categories (metrics, comprehension, model quality, methods &amp; tools and adoption) we discuss the findings of the papers in that category. Finally we compare 365 our study with similar ones, assess the threats to validity arising from our procedures, and draw some conclusions in terms of how well we can answer the above research questions and what further studies are needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONDUCT OF THE REVIEW</head><p>We first outline some of the key elements of the experimental protocol that was developed for the original mapping study, and then describe the ways in which the initial study was extended into a more comprehensive SLR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scope of the study</head><p>The protocol identified the scope of the study as follows:</p><p>• Population: The published scientific literature reporting empirical evaluations on elements of the UML. • Intervention: Any empirical study involving UML models and forms.</p><p>• Outcomes of relevance: The quantity and type of evidence related to the models and forms.</p><p>• Experimental design: We looked for any experiment or other form of empirical study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The inclusion/exclusion criteria</head><p>In making decisions about whether to include a paper in the study we adopted the following inclusion criteria:</p><p>• Primary studies published in journals or conference papers in the form of experiments, surveys, case studies, experience reports and observation papers, representing empirical analysis of aspects of the UML. • Any study for which there was more than one published description was only included once.</p><p>• For those papers reporting more than one study, each study was treated separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The exclusion criteria were</head><p>• Primary studies that did not describe empirical studies about the UML.</p><p>• Secondary Literature Reviews.</p><p>• Elements of 'grey' literature, such as technical reports and papers, in journals that did not use a well-defined referee process.</p><p>We also applied a minimal element of quality assessment, mainly to the effect that for a paper to be included it had to have been published in a refereed source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The process</head><p>The procedures involved in performing a systematic review or mapping study are intended to be well defined, in order to ensure that such a study is objective and repeatable. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the overall process in the form of an extended activity diagram. The core steps that we undertook for the mapping study, as shown on the left of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> were 1. A systematic search of a set of four major electronic databases: IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect and EMBASE using a defined set of keywords. (The choice of electronic sources for a study is obviously important, and these were chosen as ones that were likely to include relevant papers.) 2. Removal of duplicates (because there is some overlap between the electronic databases covered by the different search engines, some papers are found by more than one of them). 3. The application of inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine which of the studies we found should be included in the final set. 4. An analysis of the papers, classifying them on the basis of such issues as the form of empirical study employed and the aspect of the UML investigated. At this stage we also identified where pairs of papers reported the same study and removed the earlier versions (usually these were a conference report).</p><p>The numbers to the right of the activities on the left in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> show the number of papers remaining after each of steps 1-3. For the purposes of the preliminary report, the decisions for steps 2 and 3 were based upon the information available from the titles and abstracts of each paper.</p><p>As the quality of reporting in abstracts is often poor (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>), we erred on the side of caution when applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extending the study</head><p>In extending the study we repeated both some elements of the search, as well as extending this to cover the period up until the end of 2008. We also undertook a more comprehensive analysis of the papers, based upon reading the complete papers. This process is shown on the right in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>For searching, we restricted ourselves to the IEEE, ACM Guide and ScienceDirect electronic databases, as these had been the most useful in the previous search, and also because access to EMBASE was not readily available. These index the major relevant publishers of conference 367 proceedings and journals, including Elsevier and Springer. The original search had also used the British spelling of 'modelling', whereas many papers (and the UML) use the US spelling of 'modeling'. It would appear that few, if any, searching tools recognize these as being synonyms, and hence we employed both forms in the extended search and ensured that this covered the years prior to 2008. One of the problems encountered in conducting searches by using electronic databases of software engineering publications, is the range of interface forms that are provided by these. Hence the strings need to be separately mapped on to the forms provided in each interface. Appendix A lists the set of search strings that we employed.</p><p>In addition to making a more comprehensive search, we also undertook a process of snowballing in two stages: using the original set of papers; and then using the additional papers found. To perform this, for each paper that was included, the member of the team who was assigned to the papers in the relevant category checked the references in the paper. (This involves looking at the titles of all of the references, as well as the text of the paper.) We then checked the selected references to eliminate any that referenced a paper that was already in our list of candidates. The next step was to check the abstracts of the remaining candidate papers, and where necessary, the papers, in order to add any that seemed suitable to our list. For the original set of papers, this process resulted in our adding an additional seven <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> papers-which is a proportion that is higher than commonly experienced (we would usually expect up to an additional 10% of papers). However, this increase is deceptive, since the majority of the papers came from one category (metrics) for reasons that are explained later. For the second round of snowballing, we then added another seven <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> papers, spread across the categories.</p><p>To perform data extraction, we obtained copies of all of the papers that were included on the basis of the information provided in their title and abstract. A number of these were then excluded on the basis of the fuller information provided in the paper itself (the terms 'experiment' and 'survey' are sometimes used rather casually by authors). For the remaining papers, we then undertook a process of data extraction and classification (and in some cases, reclassification) as described in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The classification process</head><p>One of the challenges that a mapping study presents is that the set of categories used for classifying the outcomes cannot readily be defined in advance, since it is highly dependent upon what is found. Based upon our original analysis, using only titles and abstracts, we identified a set of themes and categorized our papers using these. To assist the process of analysis, we then assigned the task of analysing the papers in each category to individual members of our team, according to their expertise.</p><p>To ensure consistency in performing this task, for which data extraction is an important element, we used a standard data extraction form. This was based upon the forms used in some of our previous studies, but was extended to address data extraction from reports of case studies and surveys as well as from reports of experiments. A copy of this is provided as Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the outcomes</head><p>In the mapping study, removing duplicates from the set of papers found in the initial search left 60 papers, and further sifting by two of us (DB and RP) resulted in a set of 33 papers. (While this number is small-and substantially lower than the number of books about the UML-it is not atypical of the numbers found in mapping studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In particular, while there are many studies that use the UML in some way, including to assess other topics, there are relatively few for which the UML is itself the object of study, and hence that assess the UML in some way.) Three of these were removed after fuller analysis, leaving 30, with snowballing adding another 7.</p><p>The extended search used for the systematic literature review identified a further 56 candidate papers. From these, 45 were excluded after reading the titles and abstracts, and 11 were retained for further analysis based upon reading the complete paper. (Although the use of the alternative spelling of 'modeling' did find some additional papers, none turned out to be relevant. We therefore concluded that we had not missed any significant papers in the initial search, probably because both forms were found by using the string 'uml'. However, it does make a point about the limitations of search engines!) Reading the fuller papers led to the exclusion of six more, leaving a total of five papers to include in the analysis. Finally, as indicated above, snowballing then added seven further papers, giving a total of 49 papers up to the end of 2008.</p><p>From the abstracts for the original set of papers, and the themes that they addressed, we devised the classification scheme for grouping the papers that is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. The same classifications were used for the papers found in the extended search. Note, however, that some papers reported the results from more than one study. There were of course further graduations within these, and hence the classifications need to be viewed as only a very coarse partitioning of the set of papers. The organization of the study described in one paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> was such that the two phases of a cross-over experiment addressed different themes (comprehension and model quality) and hence in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> we have allocated this to both using half values. The columns in the table report on the number of papers found in the various stages of the two searches (initial-phase 1 and extended-phase 2). The category of usability only emerged after snowballing, and hence is in brackets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERPRETATION OF THE PAPERS</head><p>For the analysis presented here, we have concentrated on a subset of the categories identified for Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, namely the categories that had more than one paper at the end of Phase 1 (metrics, comprehension, model quality, methods &amp; tools) as well as adoption, since one paper was reclassified into this category on the fuller analysis. The exception was the category of notation extension, which was omitted because, although it involves studies that are about the UML, these are concerned with (potentially) modifying it, and our interest lay with the UML itself, in the form as specified by the OMG. For each category we review the issues addressed by the papers, describe the ways in which they were addressed, and summarize the main conclusions.</p><p>We should also note that as always when performing an SLR, there is often a difference between the number of papers in a category and the number of studies. This is because a paper may report more than one study-but not every study may end up being included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of metrics results</head><p>A summary of the 21 empirical studies of UML metrics as obtained from the 12 papers is shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>.</p><p>Only three of the metrics studies considered anything other than class diagrams:  Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> reported moderate relationships between lines of code and UML metrics when looking for potential early sizing metrics. They warned that prediction models would be unreliable without appropriate standards for UML diagrams and that prediction models need to be based on versions of the class diagram produced early in the life cycle.</p><p>Marchesi <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> reported the values of her proposed metrics, as calculated for three real projects. Although she also reported project effort for each project, with only three projects no serious statistical analysis was possible.</p><p>Nugroho et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> related level of detail to number of defects in class diagrams and sequence diagrams. They found a negative but non-significant relationship between number of defects and level of detail for class diagrams and a significant negative relationship between number of defects and level of detail for sequence diagrams. They looked at relationships with number of defects but did not consider class or sequence diagrams without any defects, hence the correlation study was incomplete. In addition, the context within which this study was performed was an outsourcing study where the high level designs were prepared by the client company and further development was then undertaken by the overseas outsourcing company. In such a circumstance, lack of detail in the class or sequence diagrams is likely to be serious in terms of misunderstandings and subsequent defects. However, this would be less likely to be important if the high level design was specified and then implemented by the same team of software engineers.</p><p>The remaining metrics studies comprise two families of experiments, each addressing a single topic. Marcela Genero and her colleagues undertook a series of eleven studies (in six papers: <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) at Spanish, Italian and South American Universities. They proposed a set of structure metrics for UML class diagrams that were derived from a theoretical analysis of the ontological structure of UML class diagrams and a review of the literature about existing measures used for early phases of OO projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. The metrics were based on the use of UML relationships such as associations, dependencies aggregations and generalizations. The purpose of all their studies was to investigate whether the proposed metrics were predictors of UML class diagram maintainability. They undertook a series of experiments, where subjects were given class diagrams to assess subjectively and asked to perform tasks related to understandability and modifiability. The number of studies performed is sufficient for us to be able to move beyond a simple mapping study and ask a more detailed question such as 'Which UML class metrics are the best predictors of understandability and maintainability?'. A preliminary answer to this question is provided in the following subsection.</p><p>Reynoso and his colleagues report another series of studies investigating metrics related to using OCL (Object Constraint Language) expressions that are attached to UML diagrams, rather than metrics derived directly from UML diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The metrics were derived and evaluated for theoretical validity in a different paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The goal of the studies was to assess whether the metrics were related to maintainability. Again the number of studies is sufficient to ask a more detailed question such as 'Which OCL metrics are the best predictors of understandability and maintainability?'. A preliminary answer is given in the next but one subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UML class metrics to predict maintainability and understandability</head><p>To address the question of which UML class metrics are the best predictors of maintainability and understandability, the results of Genero's studies are summarized for each metric in Tables IV and V, which show the results for correlation studies and modelling studies, respectively.</p><p>For correlation studies a 'Y' indicates a significant correlation ( p&lt;0.05) between a metric and some aspect of maintainability. For experiment 1 from paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a 'Y' implies a positive correlation for all three aspects of maintainability.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">V</ref>, for experiment 1 from paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and for both the original experiment and replication of paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, a number of different models were fitted with either Maintenance Time or  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, NA and MaxDIT were included in Usability prediction model 1. A (-) indicates that the metric had a negative parameter in a linear model which was unexpected if all the variables in the model contribute to the time required for modifications or understandability. For <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the numbers in parenthesis identify the order of influence of the metrics in a specific fuzzy rule model. Overall, there is no consistency in the selection of structural complexity metrics for maintainability prediction models. Only a few trends seem visible from the results:</p><p>• NDep was positively correlated with subjective complexity only two out of four times. It appeared in three models predicting understandability, but had a negative parameter in each model. This implies that NDep is not a reliable predictor of maintainability. • The three simple size metrics (NC, NA and NM) appear in 15 models, suggesting that they are reasonable predictors of maintainability (in particular NA), although they were not consistently correlated with subjective complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OCL metrics to predict maintainability and understandability</head><p>To address the research question 'Which OCL metrics best predict understandability and maintainability?', the outcomes of the eight relevant studies are shown in [13]</p><p>[ 14]</p><p>[ 14]</p><p>[ 15]</p><p>[ 15]</p><p>[ 17] in the study reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and the studies reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, but relatively poor results in the studies that were reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall conclusions about metrics studies</head><p>One major limitation of all the UML metrics studies is that only two of them used industrial materials and none directly involved practitioners. Another limitation is the sample size in the studies. Only three studies (first experiment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and sequence diagrams in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>) involved sufficient subjects to be able to detect medium-sized effects with a power ≥ 0.8 whereas three other studies (first experiment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>) had sample sizes that were capable of detecting medium-sized effects with a power ≥ 0.65 (for an explanation of statistical power in software engineering experiments, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). Most other studies were only capable of detecting large effects with power ≥ 0.8, but, in some cases, i.e. studies with an effective sample size less than 21, the power would be less than 0.7.</p><p>On the positive side, the series of 11 studies of UML class diagrams were based on (at least) five different sets of class diagrams (79 in all). The study materials were reused in the replication studies but in most cases it appears that new materials were constructed for different experiments. Furthermore, the UML metrics studies and the study of OCL metrics present a valuable lesson for researchers wanting to validate new metrics. The researchers first derived and validated their metrics theoretically, then they confirmed that their metrics were related to subjective understanding of complexity (addressing internal metric validity) and then investigated how they related to a specific software engineering concern i.e. maintainability (addressing external metric validity). Furthermore, although restricted to student subjects, they used students from different universities in Spain, Italy and South America, as well as a variety of different experimental materials, analysis methods and experimental designs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of comprehension results</head><p>Studies investigating comprehension of the UML forms comprises the largest set of papers. The initial classification resulted in 11 comprehension papers, and extending the search to cover 2008 resulted in a further one. Finally, snowballing from the extended set uncovered another three papers. One of the original results, paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> could not be classified as an experiment (as originally assigned) but was reclassified and included in the non-experimental set, due to the relevant and interesting nature of the results. Several papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> contain additional replication studies, either to provide further evidence or to use a different population of subjects. Two papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> are recorded here as containing two distinct studies, as the conclusions from these merit individual discussion.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">VII</ref> shows the main characteristics of this set of comprehension studies. Despite the range of studies, there are a number of similarities throughout the papers. 12 studies used students as their subjects, two used experts (one involved industrial practitioners, the other used academics), one used a mixture of students and industrial practitioners, and one used a combination of students and staff (the expertise or experience of the staff were not specified, and the experimental design did not treat the staff and students differently). In each study, students were described as having some training with the UML but little to no experience of using it. The measures used to record the performance were typically 'number of correct responses' (NRESP) or NRESP and 'time required' (TSEC). This use of common measures is beneficial in that it allows a more direct comparison between studies.</p><p>Three papers studied the use of stereotyped UML diagrams, with mixed findings. One paper found that stereotypes improved the comprehension for users with low experience/ability, while providing no significant benefit to experienced or expert users <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. A second paper found that, despite a general trend favouring stereotypes in the results, stereotyped diagrams provided no significant benefit to undergraduates <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The third paper on the subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> describes four experiments, a student-based study with two auxiliary experiments and a final study with industrial practitioners. The studies using students found that the use of stereotypes can improve comprehension, and,   whereas the industrial study was incomplete and used a small sample size, its findings reinforced these results. One study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, compared sequence, collaboration and state diagrams, and later repeated the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Further studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, compared sequence and collaboration diagrams. Three of these studies concluded that sequence diagrams provide the greatest comprehension performance, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> found that collaboration diagrams allow greater comprehension. A fourth study <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> used a controlled experiment and a replication to explore the effects of composite states on the comprehensibility of statechart diagrams; the results showed that composite states improve comprehension where subjects have some prior experience in their use. Similarly, a second study reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> explored the use of paired diagrams, finding that, depending on the application domain, the sequence and state diagram pairing provides the best comprehension performance.</p><p>Two of the papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> provided a pair of studies comparing syntactically equivalent notational variants, one for class diagrams and one for collaboration diagrams, and these found that the syntax used had a measurable effect on the comprehensibility of UML diagrams. This is supported by qualitative work from another study (the one that was reclassified as a non-experiment), which concluded that even among experts ill-defined syntax can be a major problem in UML comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Another study compared the comprehensibility and maintainability benefits of using OCL as well as UML, finding that once sufficient experience has been gained, the inclusion of OCL did improve the performance overuse of the UML alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>A study investigating the benefits of using object diagrams as well as class diagrams to model static data <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, concluded that the presence of the additional information provides an improvement over using class diagrams alone, although the author acknowledged that the small sample size necessitated a follow-up or replication study.</p><p>Two papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> explore the effects of the application domain on comprehension performance, both study a management information system (MIS) and a real-time system (RT). One study <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> found that TSEC is independent of the application domain; that when modelling RT systems, state diagrams are better in certain conditions and that domain has no effect when using paired diagrams. Conversely, Glezer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> found that collaboration diagrams provide better performance for RT systems, and that MIS applications take longer to comprehend than RT systems. In general, the studies appear to show that the application domain has little effect on the comprehension performance, regardless of the diagram type. Where significant results are found, there is little agreement between the two papers; this is attributed to the experience and expertise of the student subjects, and requires further study.</p><p>The most important common factor, however, is the underlying assumption that because the UML is a de facto standard it does not itself require testing. Whether the test is comparing notational variants, assessing stereotypes or measuring the relative performance of different diagrams, the studies are simply performing benchmarking within the UML. In fact, only two of the comprehension studies identified in this research compared the UML to an alternative, finding that the specification of dynamic data is faster and easier to comprehend in OML (OPEN Modeling Language <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>) than in UML <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and that comprehension of OPM (Object-Process Methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>) is significantly higher than of UML when modelling web applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. It is also interesting to note that the OPM study compared OPM to UML augmented by Conallen's Stereotypes, the same form that was studied in another paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, but considering the inconsistent results in the stereotype studies, this serves to lessen the impact of this study.</p><p>Overall, while there is a body of research examining comprehension performance within the domain of the UML; only two studies have looked beyond the UML to compare it with an alternative, and both have then found that alternative to be superior within the scope of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of model quality results</head><p>The initial set of papers for this heading was small <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> and their content did overlap to some degree with those categorized as being Methods &amp; Tools. Based upon reading the full papers, two were excluded and a third was actually re-classified as Methods &amp; Tools. However, one of those that was excluded (as being too short and lacking detail) was a summary of two fuller papers that would not have been identified in our search, and hence these were added to our set, giving a set of four papers. Two further papers were identified in the extended search, plus a further two papers from the snowballing activity, giving a final total of 8.</p><p>As observed for the set of papers in the category of Metrics, a significant proportion of the papers in this section are the work of one research team (centred upon Christian Lange and Michel Chaudron).</p><p>Within the set of papers we can identify two very different views of model quality, both of which are relevant to this study.</p><p>• The first group is concerned with the properties of the model itself, where this is recorded using the different forms available in the UML. We have labelled this group as 'UML-properties' for the purposes of discussion. There is some overlap with the ideas of the Metrics category as this group of studies tends to use a set of measures that are applied to the design model. However, the distinction from metrics is that here the rules are applied to the model itself rather than its form and tend to be seeking to identify things, such as incomplete elements and mismatches between design assumptions. • The second group investigate how effectively the model can be used, considered from the viewpoint of the human user. We have labelled this group as 'UML-use'.</p><p>The first group of papers (UML-properties) is dominated by a series of papers from Lange and Chaudron, using a case study, a survey and an experiment to investigate how defects can occur in the model itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The fourth paper, by Nugroho and Chaudron <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> describes a survey of how the UML is used that focused upon such issues as completeness of models, how far different syntactic features are used, and how the model is kept aligned with the resulting code. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">VIII</ref> summarizes the details of these studies, as well as their key findings.</p><p>The second group (UML-use) is somewhat similar to the studies of comprehension, only here the focus is upon how effective different forms of notation are, and all the studies involve laboratory experiments. Two of them have compared UML class diagrams with other forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>, whereas the other two have compared two forms from the set provided in the UML <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">IX</ref> summarizes these studies and their key findings. We should note that for the study by Glezer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, phase 1 of their experiment involved comprehension tasks, whereas phase 2 involved quality assessment of the models produced, and in this section we only report on phase 2.</p><p>The small size of the set of studies, together with the lack of commonality across participants, UML forms studied, and types of study used, makes it impossible to use forms other than tabulation to aggregate the findings on a systematic basis. However from a qualitative basis, we can note the recurrence of certain issues in the UML-properties group such as</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• incompleteness of models, • inconsistency of models across different viewpoints,</head><p>• inconsistent interpretation of the models.</p><p>However, we should also note that this group of studies were all the work of one research group.</p><p>In addition, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, Lange et al. note that Design choices are scattered over multiple views. For instance, some dependencies might show up in the logical view, while others appear in the process view.</p><p>As this is really a characteristic of the design process, it does demonstrate a problem that arises with all viewpoint-based modelling forms, not just the UML.</p><p>The second group of studies (UML-use) is both too small and also too varied to draw much in the way of general conclusions. The two studies looking at class diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> had rather varied results, and were looking at very different characteristics. A third study <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> focussed upon preferences for a form, rather than whether it was more effective as such, whereas the fourth study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> compared the use of two 'interaction' notations for describing MISs and RT systems. Taking  this group with the studies of comprehension in the preceding section, there appears to be a clear 'gap' in that we could not really identify any studies, beyond that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, that explored how effective the different UML notations (or combinations of these) were when used for the purpose of design. Of course, software design is a complex process and the characteristics of software (and of the object model) do compound this further <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Thus, while the UML evidently does present problems, none of the studies discussed in this section used any baseline that would allow us to determine whether these were greater or less than those that occur when using other forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of methods and tools results</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, eight papers were initially classified as addressing methods and tools of relevance to the use of the UML. One of these papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> describes two studies, one <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, which focuses on the adoption of the UML within an organization, was (re) classified as an adoption paper, one was re-classified as a comprehension study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and a paper initially classified under model quality was re-classified as a methods and tools paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. In this category, therefore, we have seven papers which describe eight empirical studies: six experiments, one multi-case study and one survey. The papers are summarized in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">X</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_10">XI</ref>.</p><p>The methods and tools investigated include Visio, Rational Rose, SORT (an approach for the systematic refinement and translation of UML diagrams), derivation-oriented and validationoriented techniques for making the transition from functional requirements to OO design, a range of graph drawing layout aesthetics, perspective-based reading (PBR) and checklist-based reading (CBR) of design documents, a tool that supports task-oriented views (MetricView Evolution tool) and a tool to provide automated support for identifying changes made to UML model elements as well as determining the impact of these changes on other model elements.</p><p>The particular characteristics that were measured include usability, correctness, time taken, completeness, quality, preference and number of defects found.</p><p>Of the six experiments, four can be considered independent studies, where the methods or tools being compared were not developed by the evaluators. Two of these studies compared a derivation technique and a validation technique for making the transition from functional requirements to class diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The first of these used student subjects and the second was a replication with practitioners. The results, for student subjects, showed that the validation technique led to more complete (class) diagrams. For practitioners, no difference between the two techniques with respect to completeness was found. However, the derivation technique resulted in diagrams with slightly better structure in both experiments, although the difference was not significant for practitioners. There was no difference with respect to time for the two techniques. The other two independent studies investigated the effect of different graph drawing layout aesthetics on usability <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and compared PBR with CBR <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. The results of the PBR/CBR comparison indicated that time spent on inspection by subjects who used PBR was less than for those who used CBR. However, the cost per defect for PBR subjects was higher than for CBR subjects.</p><p>The multi-case study and two of the experiments evaluated methods or approaches developed by one or more of the authors and each found benefits from the use of their approach. The multi-case study demonstrated that a tool to identify changes made to UML model elements and to determine the impact of these changes on other model elements (iACMTool)was both feasible and practical <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The evaluators of SORT found that the system developed by applying SORT technology was significantly easier to understand and verify than the ad hoc system <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, whereas the tool to support task-oriented views improved correctness of comprehension and reduced the time taken to perform the tasks specified <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</p><p>The survey is reported in the form of an abstract of a student poster and compares student experiences of using Rational Rose and Visio as UML modeling tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Data were collected from 95 students. The results are mixed, with Visio gaining more support for the symbols used and for documentation, whereas Rose was considered to offer more features and better output.</p><p>Of the six experiments in this category, five used student subjects (as did the survey) and all used artificial experimental material. The survey examined six of the notations and employed a web-based survey form. There were 171 usable responses. In terms of the second question (the one most relevant to this paper), they observe that 'regular usage of UML components were lower than expected' and suggest that the difficulty of understanding (and the cost of learning) many of the notations 'support the argument that the UML may be too complex'. (We should note that they were analysing UML1.5, which has fewer notations than the current standard.)</p><p>Bolloju and Leung <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> studied the quality of 'UML artefacts' (class, use case, and sequence diagrams) produced by 15 teams of undergraduate students. They coded the errors according to a pre-defined scheme that separated these into three categories: syntactic; semantic and pragmatic. While the goal of the study was to identify the nature of the errors made by users of the UML notations, the study does offer a useful complementary view to that of this study-and as such, highlights the challenges implicit in interpreting the results from such studies.</p><p>The SLR by Mohagheghi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> addresses model-based software development, noting that 'the UML is currently the most widely used modelling language'-but also that it can be used in multiple ways. Their study used a focused search (selected conferences and journals) and covered up to October 2007, identifying 40 primary studies that were related to model quality, but were not confined to empirical studies. While their primary sources partly overlap with the papers covered in this review, their study was more concerned with the use of the UML, and in particular, upon conventions for its use. As the focus was on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) the conclusions from the study do not really relate to the qualities of the UML itself.</p><p>The second SLR, by Lucas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, examined 42 papers that were concerned with UML model consistency, extracted from an initial set of 907. Their particular focus was upon consistency within multiple views of the same system. As this was again within the context of MDE, there is of course some overlap of interest with that of the preceding paper, and again, the emphasis lies upon the use of the UML and the scope is really one of models rather than empirical studies. Consequently, there are no conclusions that can readily be linked to the issues addressed in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Threats to validity</head><p>A systematic literature review such as this one has two evident threats to its validity: first whether we have adequately identified the major elements in the literature and second whether our classification has been robust enough. In terms of the former, while our searching only used a limited set of search engines, these did encompass the major publishers of conference proceedings (IEEE, ACM and Springer) and the major journals that publish empirical papers. As commonly occurs with SLRs, the use of snowballing has identified a number of additional papers, (including one paper that should have been found by the search engines), but nothing to indicate that our coverage was inadequate. However, we should note the problems encountered with searching publications such as Communications of the ACM, where the abstracts are apt to be very short (as an example, the abstract for <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> is only nine words long).</p><p>Classification was identified as a potential threat in our original report, where the analysis was based upon the information provided in the abstracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This study has addressed five of the categories identified in that report, and not surprisingly, more detailed scrutiny has led to the exclusion of further papers as well as reclassification of some papers. While not all papers fit exactly into a particular category, there is little to suggest that we have omitted any significant ones. We should also observe that our analysis has been based upon having only one analyst perform the data extraction under each topic-possibly adding further bias. However, since there were a number of 'exchanges' of papers between categories, a proportion of them have been scrutinized by more than one researcher.</p><p>A further threat to validity is that, within some categories at least, most of the studies of a particular aspect have been the work of one group of researchers. This occurs both within metrics and also model quality. While obviously researchers seek to minimize bias, there is always some risk of an unrecognized source of bias being present, and the effect might then be greater for these groups of studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>Here we briefly summarize the implications of the different aspects that we have considered in this analysis.</p><p>For metrics, there is only one study that has looked at using UML diagrams to predict development size. This found that the number of external use cases and the number of classes were weak predictors of lines of code. Results from the series of metrics studies related to structure and coupling confirm that it is possible to specify such metrics from UML diagrams and OCL statements. However, the evidence also suggests that the UML structure metrics are no better at predicting maintainability than standard OO size metrics. In addition, no consistent predictive relationships were found for the OCL metrics. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that using UML diagram metrics will significantly improve the predictability of software projects.</p><p>In the case of comprehension, the topics studied are rarely the properties of the 'core' UML notations. Relatively few studies address either syntax or semantics of UML notations to identify where barriers may exist for both use and understanding. Also, while this topic did attract a wider group of researchers, effort is somewhat scattered and we did not identify any replicated studies.</p><p>Model quality provides a somewhat smaller set of studies than the other topics considered above, and like metrics, many of these stemmed from the efforts of one team of researchers. Neither of the sets of studies of UML-properties and of UML-use were large enough or coherent enough for any useful aggregation. In addition, there is a possibly important point in the quotation from Lange et al. to the effect that design decisions and knowledge is apt to be scattered over different views. If so, then simply employing (say) class diagrams in a study may not be appropriate. Some of the findings should perhaps really be considered alongside those from the comprehension group for anyone who is planning to undertake further studies.</p><p>For methods and tools there is again some overlap of focus with the preceding headings, which is perhaps not surprising. Also less surprising, in the light of previous comments, is the tendency to focus upon the 'method' aspect rather than on the UML itself. As another observation, the emphasis upon the use of experiments rather than observational studies for this group of papers means that tool use has largely only been studied in artificial settings.</p><p>Finally the set of studies about adoption, in addition to making some useful observations, provides an indication of the 'gaps' in our knowledge about the UML. Indeed, this group was largely included to highlight the lack of detailed knowledge about a very important aspect of the UML.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We first examine the answers to our four research questions and then consider some implications of these.</p><p>• How many papers have reported on empirical evaluations on the models and forms used in the UML? As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> we identified 49 papers that report empirical studies. • Which aspects of the UML have been most subjected to empirical study? In terms of our chosen categories, the answer is metrics together with comprehension. As much of the metrics work stems from one group, it could be argued that comprehension is probably studied more widely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Which aspects of the UML could be recommended as topics for further empirical study?</head><p>Clearly all could benefit from further study, but adoption does emerge as a topic of interest to practitioners which needs further investigation, along with comprehension. • Which research methods are most frequently employed in studies of the UML? The preceding sections demonstrate a strong preponderance of laboratory experiments, with many of these being of relatively short duration (typically 1-3 h). If we turn this question around slightly, we can note that there is correspondingly little use of 'field' studies.</p><p>One of the roles of an SLR is to provide a baseline for future studies, enabling researchers to position new work where it is likely to be most valuable. Our review does provide such a baseline, which we hope will be used by other researchers, and in the next few paragraphs we add some further observations about how this review might be interpreted. Our first observation is to the effect that one of the underlying themes that is evident in this set of studies is a tendency to regard the UML as being a 'fixed' basis for studies, encouraging a reluctance to probe too deeply into its forms, despite some indications that these are far from being fit for purpose. Indeed, this lack of questioning about our models is not a unique problem in software engineering. As an example, a similar study that we have been conducting into software design patterns has identified only 11 papers describing experimental studies asking questions about patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Thus, one of the major challenges that evidence-based studies such as these pose for us as a community, is that we should be more ready to question the frameworks that we use, rather than accept them as given.</p><p>Related to this is our second observation, which is about potential experimental bias. Where empirical studies were employed, and experiments in particular, there was quite extensive use of student participants. While this is not necessarily inappropriate, the UML is intended to support design activities and the design skills of students are likely to be significantly different from those of more experienced developers. Few studies really seemed to address this in terms of justifying their use of student participants, although a number were undertaken using participants from both groups.</p><p>The observation above then leads on to a third one, which is the emphasis upon the use of controlled laboratory experiments. For some issues (comprehension is an obvious one), the rationale for using experiments can be quite strong, although by no means exclusive. However, there were very few studies that undertook deeper observational investigation in realistic settings, with most studies using relatively simple forms of data collection, rather than techniques such as protocol analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> that might enable an understanding of the cognitive aspects of participant behaviour. Hence we have little indication as to how generally valid many of the conclusions are. This is reinforced by the small number of adoption studies, and the rather ambiguous conclusions that these have produced.</p><p>Finally, and following on in part from the previous point, the existing set of UML studies may simply be too one-dimensional. The process of software design involves a complex interplay between different views of the design model <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, whereas almost all the studies reported here (particularly the experimental ones) were focused upon class diagrams. This reinforces the argument that there is an urgent need for more field studies of how the UML is actually used in order to identify the properties likely to be of importance-accepting that these may well involve multiple views and notations.</p><p>Overall, therefore, we can offer two main conclusions from this review, as well as a general recommendation. Our conclusions are as follows:</p><p>1. There is little to give confidence that the UML has really been evaluated as an artefact in its own right, other than in a relatively fragmented manner. Few studies have used notations other than class diagrams, and where its forms have been compared with other notations, the outcomes have not been particularly conclusive, nor particularly favourable to the UML. Hence there is a need to study the UML and its forms much more rigorously and to identify which features are valuable, and which could be discarded. 2. There are few studies of adoption and use in the field. As so many studies we have identified are laboratory-based, these do tend to be centred upon one viewpoint, as well as relatively 'shallow' in the way that the UML has been used and in the amount of time that participants spend on the tasks. There is therefore a real need for more and deeper studies of its longer term use in the field.</p><p>Both these aspects have the potential to provide evidence that could be used for guiding the future evolution of the UML, but for the present, such evidence is not really available. We would therefore recommend a clear programme of effort within the community to examine the UML more systematically and more holistically, in order to help formulate ideas for how it should evolve.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY OF ADOPTION RESULTS</head><p>We found two (2) empirical studies on the adoption of the UML within commercial organizations. These were an exploratory case study <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> and a survey of UML users <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p><p>The case study addressed three research questions:</p><p>• How was the company's development process improved by adopting UML-based development? • What particular difficulties were encountered with the use of UML? • What explanations are there for why these difficulties occurred?</p><p>The 'case' that was studied was a project that used a UML-based method to develop a new version of a safety-critical system based on several existing systems. Sixteen developers and managers who were involved in the project and who were new to the use of the UML were interviewed. The study found some improvements in traceability from requirements to code, design of the code, and development of test cases. There were also improvements in communication and documentation. However, some problems or challenges were identified. These related to the difficulty and hence cost of reverse engineering of legacy code, the 'unsystematic' distribution of requirements to teams, limitations associate with training and some difficulties with tool support.</p><p>The other adoption study surveyed users who had experience of using UML for systems development <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. The study investigated the following questions:</p><p>• Do individuals who use UML perceive it to be beneficial?</p><p>• Does UML provide a task-technology fit to individuals who utilize it?</p><p>• What are the characteristics that affect UML use? Task-technology fit theory attempts to explain the acceptance and utilization of a technology by linking performance with the fit between the task being performed and the particular type of technology being utilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. The study obtained 131 usable responses to the survey, and, on the positive side, concluded that UML was perceived as accurate, consistent and flexible enough to use for development projects. Negative responses related to compatibility across, and ambiguity between, UML diagrams.</p><p>These two studies identify a range of benefits and drawbacks associated with the adoption of UML. They particularly highlight the need for further research relating to the UML and its adoption as well as the need for, and importance of, an adequate level of training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In this section we address two issues: a comparison of how our findings compare with other studies that have addressed 'bigger' views of the UML and then an assessment of the threats to validity arising from the procedures that we have followed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related work</head><p>We can identify four other papers that provide useful comparisons with our work. The first is a survey by Dobing and Parsons <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>; the second describes how novices (students) cope with the UML <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>; whereas the other two are SLRs on model qualities that were published after the period covered by this review <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>.</p><p>The survey by Dobing and Parsons <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> addressed three key questions: the extent to which the UML analysis components were being used, and for what purposes; whether differences in the level of use 'reflect the apparent complexity of the language'; and how successful the UML was for 'facilitating communication within software development teams'. As such, only the second question really relates to this study in any way, although the other two do provide some indication of how the UML is being used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A: THE SEARCH STRINGS</head><p>The keywords for abstract search strings that we originally devised for the initial study were • 'UML' or 'Unified Modelling Language' • 'empirical', 'experience' or 'observation' • 'survey', 'experiment' and 'quasi-experiment' (We did not explicitly search for more specialist forms such as 'case study' or 'action research' since they are unlikely to occur independently of these terms. Experience from other studies also suggests that the former usually implies an observational paper rather than a systematic study, while forms such as action research seem to be unlikely ones to be used in this context.) The strings used were then further refined after prototyping with these strings (strongly recommended in all guidelines), and the study used the strings:</p><p>• ((uml) OR (unified modelling language)) AND (empirical) • ((uml) OR (unified modelling language)) AND (experiment) • ((uml) OR (unified modelling language) AND (survey)</p><p>The abstract strings were then mapped on to the search engines as follows (using the forms employed in the extended search): ACM (((Abstract:experiment) or (Abstract:empirical) or (Abstract:survey)) and (Abstract:uml) IEEE (uml &lt;or &gt; 'unified modelling language') &lt;and&gt; (experiment &lt;or &gt; empirical &lt;or &gt; survey) </p></div>			</div>
