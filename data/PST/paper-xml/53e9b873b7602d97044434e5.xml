<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Clothing computer design systems include three integrated parts: garment pattern design in 2D/3D, virtual try-on and realistic clothing simulation. Some important results have been obtained in pattern design and clothing simulation since the 1980s. However, in the area of virtual try-on, only limited methods have been proposed which are applicable to some defined garment styles or under restrictive sewing assumptions. This paper presents a series of new techniques from virtually sewing up complex garment patterns on human models to visualizing design effects through physical-based real-time simulation. We first employ an hierarchy of ellipsoids to approximate human models in which the bounding ellipsoids are optimized recursively. We also present a new scheme for including contact friction and resolving collisions. Four types of user interactive operation are introduced to manipulate cloth patterns for pre-positioning, virtual sewing and later obtaining cloth simulation. In the cloth simulation, we propose a simplified cloth dynamic model and an integration scheme to realize a high quality realtime cloth simulation. We demonstrate the robustness of our proposed systems by complex garment style virtual try-on and cloth simulation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Computer-aided design (CAD) has become one of the most indispensable elements in modern industry and its use has started to spread across the textile and apparel industry in recent decades. In today's rapidly changing business environment CAD technology speeds up the product development process and shortens the time to market of fashion products. Research on clothing related CAD has bloomed in recent years. Many system prototypes and computer techniques have been proposed in an effort to fulfill industrial needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The research focus has been to develop systems for assisting designers in the clothing design process. In general, clothing CAD systems usually involve one or more of five key processes which are: 2D pattern design, pattern prepositioning, a virtual sewing process (also called virtual try-on), drape simulation and design modification in 2D or 3D.</p><p>Computer science has recently made significant contributions to the area of 3D clothing CAD. The methods developed have been mainly based on the idea of geometric pre-positioning and aim at physical-based simulation of drape results. Although physicalbased simulation has proved to be the best method for showing the drape results of garments <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, no method can yet lay claim to be the best for pre-positioning. The major task of pre-positioning is to place garment pattern pieces in their desired positions around a human model. This is a difficult task because of the complex and irregular shape of pattern pieces and multi-directional sewing. The most often used approach is to place pattern pieces of the clothes around the human models as rigid 2D planes, then use sewing constraints to force them together (sewing up) in the following simulation, and finally show the effects of drape. This method has drawbacks, the major ones of which are that the human models are often required to be in static postures and that such rigid pre-positioning can only cater for simple styles such as garments involving a limited number of pattern pieces without complex seams. It is obvious that a more flexible pre-positioning scheme is required by the clothing industry because fashion products, by their very nature, have countless style variations and designs.</p><p>Apart from the requirement for flexible prepositioning, the textile industry also demands an interactive real-time simulation to speed up the product development processes. Traditional fashion product development is an iterative process, which starts with designers preparing patterns and prototypes based on experiences of similar styles before, trying on the prototype on a dress form for fit evaluation, from which necessary alterations are made and another prototype is prepared. The cycle repeats with a number of trials until a satisfactory fit is achieved. Physical simulation would allow designers to visualize the design and drape effect without having to prepare prototype garments. Even though a great deal of work has been done, mainly in the area of computer graphics, real-time physical-based simulation of cloth is still not yet possible because of the substantial requirements it places on computation, simulation stability, robustness and speed.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a system that allows users to manipulate clothing patterns to desired positions of human models by four predefined operations of move, rotate, fix and drag. We adopt a physical-based modeling of clothing patterns that can stretch and bend due to shape changes of the body surface. It provides accurate pre-positioning that ensures very short distances of seam line particles before and after the sewing process. With the proposed method, we do not need to make any assumptions about the postures of the human models. Moreover, users are allowed to adjust patterns and garment positions during the virtual sewing process, which makes the trying on of complex styles with multiple seams possible. As aforementioned, our proposed systems are physical-based, and the reasons why realtime simulation is possible in our approach are twofold. First, a hierarchy of ellipsoid bounding volumes is used to approximate the human body, and this method bounds the human body tightly <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The method also detects contacts/collisions between garment and the human model more efficiently. Second, our physical simulation is based on the Stoermer-Verlet numerical integration scheme that simplifies the collision responses by geometrical based correction of position. Our method is efficient and robust, enabling the trying on of different garment types. The proposed method is physically faithful because high-quality physical simulation is performed to visualize the drape effects once the garments are 'tried on'.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, Section 2 gives a retrospective view of past work in clothing simulation and clothing CAD. In Section 3 we briefly outline how our realtime system works. Then, the proposed method is explained in detail. Section 4 describes the method of volume segmentation and bounding volume computation for a human model. Section 5 is dedicated to a presentation of the collision detection and collision response with ellipsoids, and also the corresponding contact friction models. Next, Section 6 introduces the four types of user manipulation. The physical model of clothing and the numerical integration scheme are explained in Section 7 and, finally, the experimental results are given in Section 8.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Clothing simulation</head><p>The community of computer graphics became interested in clothing simulation in the late 1980s and research in this area has bloomed since then. Some surveys can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and some textbooks have even been written <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>The methods proposed by the computer graphic community opened up a new direction for the textile industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Terzopoulos et al. were the first to use physical models for cloth simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Breen et al. developed a non-continuum particle model for predicting cloth drape <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. They also used physical-based modeling to produce a good drape simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Choi and Ko presented a stable and practical method to handle the post-buckling instability without introducing a damping force into the dynamic simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In their results, cloth can be animated with natural winkles. Zhou et al. explored the micro-structure of woven fabrics to simulate mechanical behavior of cloth based on the thin-shell theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Zhou also proposed a novel physical model to solve the vibration problem which does always occur on the mass-spring system when simulating clothes with large rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Besides, in order to accelerate cloth simulation many techniques have been proposed. For example, Baraff and Witkin proposed an implicit Euler integration method to compute the cloth simulation in realtime <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This technique has become a popular technique for integrating the equations of motion in cloth simulation. Meyer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and Desbrun <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> used a hybrid explicit/implicit integration algorithm to animate real-time clothes, integrating it with a voxel-based collision detection algorithm. At the same time, Cordier and Thalmann proposed a hybrid integration scheme exploiting the merits of both the physical-based and geometric deformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. It made use of predetermined conditions between the cloth and the body model, avoiding complex collision detection and response. Although the methods mentioned above can generate cloth simulation results with visual realism at a reasonable speed, they are still not efficient enough for interactive use. The main bottlenecks were collision detection and response calculation. Consequently, many methods were proposed. A new approach using cloth surface curvature was proposed by Volino and Thalmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Their techniques can efficiently deal with complex collisions resulting from highly deformable surfaces. Gottschalk used a hierarchy of bounding volume to significantly reduce the number of comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Provot proposed the concept of impact region to solve the problem of collision handling <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. His method significantly reduced the self-collision detecting computation because self-intersection can be eliminated for an 'impact region' with sufficiently low curvature. An efficient and robust collision handling technique combining the repulsion force, friction and geometric property was proposed by Bridson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Their technique can work well with major methods for simulating internal dynamics. In our proposed method, we use a geometrical scheme based on the correction of position to handle collision response, which ensures good stability of simulation without re-computation of dynamic equations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Clothing CAD systems</head><p>The clothing industry has been using 2D pattern design systems (PDS) to help designers simplify their work for many years, and the industry has recently started to look into 3D features <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Wang's system constructs garments directly in 3D space and then flattens the designed 3D surfaces to obtain 2D patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The resulting patterns, however, are not yet ready for industrial use <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Hu et al. employed expert knowledge to control the process of garment design by interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Their system supports collaboration among designers and experts. An online made-to-measure system was presented by Cordier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, in which the system allows virtual try-on of garments on the web according to shoppers' body measurements. Some initial work on interactive techniques was proposed by Volino et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Fuhrmann et al. proposed an interaction free method for geometric pre-positioning of single pieces of clothing patterns with respect to a human body <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This approach uses developable surfaces, like cylinders or cones, to position clothing patterns around the virtual human. A purely geometrical method was proposed to put clothes on 3D virtual characters by manipulating clothes around body surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. This approach combines the whole process of garment design and display with user interaction, but their work is not physically faithful and obviously not intended for clothing industry application. All these works mentioned above have significantly promoted research in the clothing CAD area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">System architecture</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>, three modules, the human model process, the garment process and user interaction modules, together with a simulation engine are included in our interactive virtual tryon clothing design systems. Each of the three modules can either generate some necessary data (about the garments or the human model) or interpret user commands. In the human process module, human models are obtained from 3D scanning or mesh models by ellipsoid segmentation. Human models are optimized for virtual trying on of different garments even tight-fit ones like jeans. The garment process module provides information on garment patterns and seams. The user interactive module defines user operations for real-time simulation. All the data is input to the real-time simulation engine. The engine drives the pre-calculated data and user commands to realize precise pre-positioning, sewing and dynamic adjusting, finally simulating the drape results. All process modules of our systems are programmed under a modular architecture, which means they are independent from each other thus good for further development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Garment process module</head><p>The garment process module mainly supplies the clothing patterns and seam information to the simulation engine. As this module involves some standard operations, we briefly outline its process in this section, while other modules will be described in detail in later sections. One garment is usually composed of a number of pattern pieces, for example, front panels, back panels and other affiliates like sleeves, collars, pockets etc. Each pattern has an irregular shape (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> for some sample patterns). Our virtual try-on systems assemble the pattern pieces as a completed garment on a human model by sequential seams.</p><p>In our garment process module, two-dimensional clothing patterns are developed by standard pattern design systems (PDS). Patterns are recorded as sequences of two-dimensional control vertices at the edges, from which pattern models, in the form of meshes, are developed by raster algorithms. The patterns are transferred into discrete mass-particles connecting by three types of spring. These springs represent the stretch, shear and bending forces among mass particles, which impart cloth behaviors.</p><p>In addition to 2D patterns, assembly information (seams, darts, overlap, buttons, etc.) and fabric material parameters must be prepared to generate a complete physical model for a virtual sewing simulation. The seam information is represented as joining vertices, which are defined in the same data structure as garment patterns. As patterns are defined as meshes of different shapes (each is tagged with an index), the seam information includes the corresponding mesh index and the start particle and end particle information of the seam line. After sewing, the involved pattern meshes are replaced by a new mesh, where every particle, except those on seam lines, keeps both its current and previous status including the position, velocity and acceleration. The positions of particles on seam lines are re-calculated as the sum of vector positions of the corresponding joining vertices. The spring information is also transferred, in which the springs of the new particles are combined by all the springs that connect with its parents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Initial segmentation</head><p>In the human model process module, we obtain human models of different sizes (height, chest circumference and waistline, etc.) by 3D scanning or other model development tools such as MakeHuman <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and Poser software. The human model data can be in the form of a point cloud or surface mesh. These human models must be pre-processed (shape approximated) in order to accelerate the simulation efficiency. In this paper, a variational method is used to compute the initial segmentation of human models in which ellipsoids are chosen as the bounding primitive because ellipsoids give a tighter volume bound and higher shape fidelity than other primitive shapes. The variational approach to compute a partition of an object often involves data clustering based on a Lloyd iteration. The most commonly used metric for this kind of application is the Euclidean metric. However, the Euclidean metric is isotropic and not good for segmenting parts of elongated shapes. Lu <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed a new anisotropic metric based on an affine invariant concept of e-tightness, such a metric is suitable for computing optimal segmentation of 3D objects on the basis of tight bounding volumes. With this new metric of e-tightness, any 3D model can be segmented into k partitions, and each partition is bounded by one ellipsoid tightly. The number of k, defined by the user and called seed points, can be any natural number.</p><p>In the initial segmentation, a human body, in the form of either point clouds or surface meshes, is first sampled into a set of uniformly distributed regions. Skeleton information of the human body is used as the initial seed points for segmentation because well selected initial seeds lead to good segmentation results and quick convergence. In computer animation the skeleton is usually defined as a hierarchical set of bones. The standard skeleton of a human body in computer animation has twenty bones and their corresponding joints. Therefore, a seed point is assigned to the center of each bone in our case. Each bone keeps the information of its parent bone and three-dimensional transformations including position, length and orientation. A full transform of a child node (bone) is the product of its parent transform and its own transform. For example, moving a thigh bone will move the lower leg too. In computer animation, bones are defined as a hierarchy and, similarly, we construct our hierarchy of ellipsoids using the skeleton information. The top level of hierarchy is composed of twenty ellipsoids representing the twenty skeleton bones.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows the initial segmentation results by variational method using skeleton information as initial seed points and the resulted bounding ellipsoids. With our ellipsoid hierarchy definition, each ellipsoid is associated with a portion of the human body. Therefore, the segmentation algorithms are restricted in the volume of parent ellipsoids only. This makes it easy to set different attributes for these ellipsoids, which is necessary information for the following processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Metric definition -maximal normal distance</head><p>With reference to the result in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, it is shown that even though the bounding ellipsoids enclose the human model tightly, it is not to a level adequate for a clothing CAD system because the model is not yet precise enough for trying on tight-fit garments like jeans. The approximation of human body parts must be split and refined continuously until a required quality level (i.e. some defined error thresholds) are reached.</p><p>Error measures are usually volume based for collision detection applications, which include both local and global bounding volume errors. However, volume based error measure is not suitable for our application; instead, distance-based error measures are used. This is because, in the clothing industry, some measurements such as body height, bust/chest girth, waist girth, hip girth and length of legs are important measurements for clothing design and fit evaluation. In other words, the tightness of the bounding volume in these regions is of vital importance for human models developed for virtual try-on of clothes. Therefore, we use the girth of the bounding volume as the error measures.</p><p>However, there is no simple method to calculate the girth of bounding ellipsoids when there are several overlapping ellipsoids. We propose a new error measure, named maximal normal distance (MND), to evaluate the distance error between the human body surface and its bounding ellipsoids as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E MND = max{ v i -n e (v i ) , ∀ v i ∈ E} (1)</formula><p>where • is Euclidean distance. v i is one of the voxel points, E, on the human body surface (S human ), n e (v i ) is the intersection point between ellipsoid surface (S ellipsoid ) and the normal line of v i . MND is similar to the Hausdorff distance, which measures the distance between two compact non-empty subsets of a metric space. MND can also be considered as a directional constrained Haursdorff distance. We use E MND to estimate the maximal error of bounding ellipsoids, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Although this is more computationally expensive than other distance based error measures like Liu's radial projection distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, our method avoids the potential magnification of distance errors in some circumstances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Splitting algorithm</head><p>In order to generate models of bounding ellipsoids close to the human body as tightly as possible, a splitting algorithm is proposed to segment and refine the ellipsoid models. A region of the human body bounded by one ellipsoid is split into two if the value of E MND is greater than a pre-defined threshold. The splitting process is implemented iteratively until the required threshold value of E MND is met. For efficiency reasons, varied threshold values can be assigned to different body regions depending on the types of garment to be tried on. Using the region of the thigh as an example, smaller threshold values would be used for trying on jeans than skirts. Of course, larger values of the threshold take a longer time in the final drape simulation as there are larger gaps between the surface of ellipsoids and the surface of corresponding human models.</p><p>We use a variational method to refine the local segmentation. Our method for segmentation refinement may not be the most efficient one nor can it guarantee the best result, yet it is evolutional. Such a refinement is a local optimization process where the results are evaluated at every incremental step to achieve the best possible result. There are two alternative ways of splitting in local segmentation (see Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> for illustration). Suppose the green square is a region to split. The blue region is another portion of human body connecting to the splitting region. We can assign two seed points in two different ways: either assign them to the voxels of surfaces facing out of the human body (upper part of Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>) or to the voxels of surfaces connecting to other portions of human body (the bottom part of Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>). These two ways of seed point assignment will generate different segmentation results. In the first way of seed assignment, the ellipsoid is split into two with flat arc parts facing out of human body and fat arc It is thus very important to develop an algorithm to automatically evaluate the splitting condition and choose the appropriate seed points.</p><p>By comparing the maximal normal distance with the threshold value, we can identify the regions to split. For a splitting region, we can set the two seed points as the center and the farthest points, but it is not clear which of the above ways of splitting should be implemented. We thus control the direction of segmentation by taking into account the skeleton information. To do so, a local coordinate system is constructed for each splitting region (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). The corresponding skeleton bone B i of the region is set as the z-axis; the vector ----→ v i n e (v i ) is the x-axis, and the cross product of v i and n e (v i ) is the y-axis. The way of splitting is estimated by λ</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">as follows λ = B i E MND (2)</formula><p>where B i is the maximal vertical length of the region along the z-axis, and E MND is the maximal normal distance along the x-axis. The larger value of λ implies that the two seed points should be assigned as far away from each other as possible along the zaxis, therefore the splitting method defined in the bottom part of Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>(a) is preferred; while the smaller value of λ means the two seed points should be assigned in a way that favors splitting along the x-axis, i.e. the splitting method defined in the upper part of Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>. By experiment, we have found that λ = 2.5 predicts the segmentation results well. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> shows the bounding results of the splitting process; it is shown that more tight-fit human models can be obtained by the splitting process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Complete algorithm</head><p>Using the splitting scheme and distance-based error measure described above, we iteratively refine the segmentation of the human body by splitting the body partitions in which the E MND values are larger than the pre-defined thresholds σ i . In the segmentation process, a hierarchy of bounding ellipsoids is produced. The root node is a virtual node denoting the whole human body H, and twenty child nodes (ellipsoids) are generated in the initial segmentation forming the first level of hierarchy. Each node in the hierarchy e j i , where j denotes the level index and i denotes the child index, can produce a maximum of two child nodes (one split into two i = 0 or 1) except the root node H.</p><p>The two child nodes are fully covered by their parent ellipsoid. The complete algorithm is as follows: Choose one P i that E MND &gt; σ i , set two seed points by evaluating λ i Perform splitting algorithm to refine the segmentation; evaluate the new E MND .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>If E MND &lt; E MND</head><p>Calculate bounding ellipsoids, add an additional tag indicating the parent ellipsoid they are affiliated to. Go to step 4. Otherwise:</p><p>Reseed the partition by other seed assignment scheme and go to step 6. 7. Output the hierarchy of ellipsoids as segmentation result.</p><p>It is noted that the output hierarchy of ellipsoids can also be used as bounding primitive in collision handling process. It reduces the number of potential collision pairs by eliminating objects that are obviously far apart. However, increasing the levels of the hierarchy needs a longer time for computation and comparison, also increasing the number of overlapping ellipsoids slows down the collision detection. Our result shows that the regions of legs and hands include two levels of child ellipsoids; while important regions like waist and chest include one or more levels. The collision handling will be discussed in detail in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Make use of ellipsoids</head><p>We close this section by giving a brief description of the ellipsoid implementation in our systems. A general definition of an ellipsoid is, in the form of a matrix equation, x T Ax = 1, where A is a symmetric positive definition matrix and x is a vector. The eigenvector of A defines the principal direction of the ellipsoid and the eigenvalues define the corresponding equatorial radii.</p><p>Our systems use another definition in which an ellipsoid is generated from a unit sphere by invertible linear transformation. The linear transformation is represented by a symmetric 4-by-4 matrix M e , indicating transformations of translation, rotation and scaling, while M -1 e is the inverse matrix.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Collision detection and response</head><p>Collision detection and response are very important issues in many applications of physical-based modeling and simulation, which are computationally expensive (especially in clothing simulation). It is impractical to realize real-time user interaction with a traditional collision handling scheme because real-time user interaction requires the collision handling to complete in a fixed time. In Section 4, we used the hierarchy of ellipsoids to approximate human models, and the collision handling of user interaction can be completed on this ellipsoid hierarchy to fulfill the speed requirement.</p><p>Collision detection between a particle and an object is usually implemented by checking whether a collision occurs at each time interval. Once a collision is detected, the velocity and acceleration of the corresponding mass points are changed to avoid collisions, and the dynamic equations need to re-compute. Such a collision detection scheme is computationally expensive but accurate. Some advanced methods employ bounding volumes to reduce the intersection tests. The colliding elements first test for a collision with bounding primitives, then test with the elements themselves. In our system, the collision detection and response are handled by checking whether the particle is inside the object (ellipsoid) in the interaction stage: if it is inside, the particle is moved to a position at the surface of the object that is closest to the particle's current position. In the interests of simplicity and speed, the particle is moved to the intersection position of the ellipsoid along the line that goes from the ellipsoid's center to the particle's current position.</p><p>The algorithm above can be implemented robustly and efficiently when there is only one ellipsoid. However, it cannot move particles to the right positions when dealing with a hierarchy of overlapping ellipsoids. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> illustrates three cases where the algorithm is not able to handle the collision of an ellipsoid hierarchy. In the first case, when a collision with one ellipsoid is detected, the involved particle is moved to the surface of the ellipsoid at a position p 1 . At p 1 , the particle collides with another ellipsoid that intersects with the first one, it is moved to the surface of the second ellipsoid at position p 2 . However, since the second ellipsoid is partly inside the first one, it is possible that the particle is still inside the first ellipsoid (green path in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>). In the second case, p 1 stays in the intersection part of two or more ellipsoids. As the collision of every ellipsoid is checked sequentially, different orders of collision computation would result in different response positions, which in turn cause system instability (mauve path in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>). In the last case, the particle is moved to the wrong side of the ellipsoid surface (red path in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>). To tackle these problems, we track the intersection between particle points and the surface of ellipsoid S e . Different from the traditional approach of detecting and responding to collisions with each ellipsoid sequentially [36], we split the collision handling process into two independent stages. At the first stage, we identify all ellipsoids that collide with the particle, then calculate and record every collision intersection point. At the second stage, we calculate the distance between these intersection points and the starting position, p 0 , the collision position is the one with the shortest distance. This approach effectively keeps the particles from penetrating the joints of ellipsoids. The collision detection and response scheme described above is a purely geometrical approach so that it is more efficient compared to physical-based methods, in which dynamic equations must be modified and recomputed after each collision. Our collision scheme is proved to be very stable by experiments on different human bodies and from perfectly flat to fat arc shaped surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Contact friction</head><p>In reality, a friction force exists everywhere between two objects that are in contact. When implementing the above collision handling algorithm, clothes cannot stay on the surface of human models in the way they should without a consideration of the friction force. We introduce a scheme for adding friction to ellipsoid shape approximation.</p><p>Coulomb's friction model shows that every pair of contact materials has a single friction parameter, µ. By Newton's law, the repulsion force F R equals the normal force F N pressing on an object but in the opposite direction. Therefore, the friction has a magnitude of µF N with a direction opposite to the pre-friction relative tangential velocity v pre .</p><p>Our friction model imitates Coulomb's model. Assuming P 0 is the position of particle at time t 0 without a collision response, it is moved to P 1 at time t 1 . P c is the intersection position between the particle and the ellipsoid surface. It is assumed the ellipsoid surface is smooth, therefore when there is a collision the particle slides along the surface in a tangential direction to the surface at the intersection position (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>). The particle will move to P s if there is no friction. By the law of energy conservation, the sliding force of the particle is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F tan = l • sin α (3)</formula><p>where l is the length of line p c p 1 , its value can be considered proportional to the magnitude of colliding force. α is the angle between the normal of the surface at the intersection position and line p 0 p c . By Coulomb's frictional model, the frictional force can be represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f = l • cos α • µ.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>With contact friction the particle will stop at a position between p c and p s depending on the material's frictional coefficient, µ.</p><p>The friction effect can be represented by the ratio of the sliding distance a particle travels when there is friction to the distance when friction is not involved as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ω = l • sin α -l • cos α • µ l = sin α -cos α • µ.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Therefore, the final position of the particle can be calculated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p = [ω • p 1 + (1 -ω) • p c ] • T (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T = p•M -1 e p•M -1</formula><p>e M e , the collision response computation that prevents the particle from penetrating the ellipsoid. By introducing the above contact frictions, we can drag the cloth around the bounding volume surface naturally and keep the particles from penetrating the human body (ellipsoids). Our collision handling scheme is position based and it can generate realistic cloth move and drape results. Most importantly, it accelerates the simulation and makes real-time user interaction possible. The precise end position, which is a main concern of designers, can be achieved by accurate collision detection like facevertex and edge-edge detection at the final stage. Thanks to our precise pre-position, the simulation converges in a few time steps. On the other hand, the hierarchy of ellipsoids also helps to speed up the collision detection. Bounding volume collision tests can be kept to a minimum level because ellipsoids are only affiliated to certain parts of the human body based on the skeleton information. In other words, self-collision and penetration are prevented by checking the distance between two particles. Our method ensures efficient simulation without sacrificing the final drape results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">User interaction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Four types of manipulation</head><p>As mentioned at the beginning of the paper, interactive virtual try-on of complex garments needs simple (user friendly) and powerful manipulating tools for precise pre-positioning. In this section, we introduce a set of manipulations that users can interactively apply to position pattern pieces around human models. These manipulations are move, rotate, fix and drag, by which users select control vertices and indicate movement directions by mouse and/or other input device operations. The user interaction module collects operator commands and passes them on to the simulation engine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1.">Move</head><p>The move operation is used to transfer pattern pieces close to their desired positions. The move operation is easy to define, it includes only the definitions of the control of particles and the movement direction. The control particles are defined by selecting a single particle or a sequence of particles. The control particles are moved by a mouse action along a direction defined by the mouse movement, and the remaining particles are moved by the interaction of cloth particles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.">Rotate</head><p>A rotation operation is used to flip pattern pieces to the right direction. In this manipulation two groups of control particles, R and F, are selected. The average position of R particles is first calculated and defined as the center of rotation. During rotation, R particles rotate along a circular path for which the radius is defined as the distance between the R particles and the center of rotation. F particles are rotated in a similar manner as R particles. R and F particles have the same rotate center, and the only difference is that F particles do not take into account the center calculation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.">Fix</head><p>A pattern cannot stay on the surface of a human model without defining any constraint or force. As a result of this, the fix operation is defined to keep the status of pattern pieces at the desired location before sewing. The fix operation can be realized in the process of updating the simulation positions of particles. For example, the system finds a fix tag when updating the particle positions at one time step and the system sets the original position as the new position. Fix manipulation provides additional control of clothing patterns for other manipulations. For example, a particular rotation can be realized by fixing one particle of a pattern and moving the rest of the particles of the same pattern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4.">Drag</head><p>Drag is the most important and complex type of manipulation in our system. The drag operation is needed to wrap pattern pieces around the human model, see later Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12(c</ref>). It is necessary for adjusting the placement of the patterns or garment before and during the sewing process. Different from the move operation, patterns are dragged around the ellipsoid surfaces; the movement direction is therefore defined by the surface curvature together with the mouse action.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> the red line represents the tangential direction of the intersection point between po 0 and the surface of the ellipsoid; the distances d 0 and d 1 are the user defined step lengths. After the user's mouse action, the cloth particle p's movement is divided into L/d steps, where • means round up, L is the length of the mouse move in 3D space and d is the user defined parameter. At each forward step, p moves a distance of d in the tangential direction. The system implements collision tests of the new position against the adjacent ellipsoids. If a collision is detected, the tangential direction of the intersection point is assigned as the movement direction, and a new position is recalculated. This drag manipulation moves clothing patterns along the human body surface while preventing them from penetrating into the surface. In the drag operation the movement directions are constrained to be parallel with the human model's surface, while users are not allowed to pull the clothes away from the human models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Complex sewing and inter-stage adjustment</head><p>With physical-based pre-positioning and powerful user interactive tools, our system can realize complex sewing including darts, tucks and different types of seam, which was not possible by traditional geometric or automatic methods. In traditional approaches for pre-positioning, pattern pieces are placed around human models in 3D space and all seams are sewn simultaneously. Accurate pre-positioning is very difficult to achieve and no inter-stage adjustment is possible. In other words, traditional approaches do not allow designers to adjust the placement of the garment once the sewing simulation is started. Therefore, for loose fit or complex garments it is difficult to ensure the correct positioning such as, for example, the placement of collars, left right symmetry, and so forth. Instability may also result during the sewing process because the pattern pieces are forced together by seam lines in various directions. In our system, we sew patterns by sequential seams just as in a normal sewing operation where operators can adjust patterns or garment placement after each step.</p><p>Take a simple wawa style blouse as an example. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref> in later result Section 7.2, the blouse includes four pattern pieces: front panel, back panel, and two sleeves (left and right). The sewing process of a wawa blouse should follow these sequential steps: first, the front and back panels are moved close to the human model's surface, then the two shoulder seams are joined (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12(a)</ref>). Second, by adjusting the shoulder line to the correct positions the two side seams are joined (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12(b)</ref>). Third, a sleeve is moved to near the right shoulder position and the sleeve pattern is rotated to a proper direction, the sleeve pattern is dragged toward the shoulder as close as possible (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12(c)</ref>). Fourth, the sleeve seam and armhole seam are joined (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12(d</ref>)); and finally the position is adjusted and the same steps are repeated for joining the left sleeve pattern with the garment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Cloth dynamic simulation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Physical model</head><p>In this section, we briefly explain the physical model and how real-time physical simulation is realized in our method. Different physical-based cloth models have been proposed over the years aiming at accurate and reliable simulation. In view of the special requirement for user interactive operations, the main criterion for our choice of clothing model is the speed of execution. We choose a mass-spring model because it is easy to comprehend and efficient for simulation. Clothing patterns are thus represented as structured rectangular grids defined from orthogonal weft and warp directions. We simplify the mass-spring model as a uniform model, which enables parallel computation and significantly improves the simulation speed. This idea was inspired by graphic process unit (GPU) simulation technology, in which unified spring models combined with high levels of parallel ability have enabled the speed of simulation to reach new summits <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>. However, the GPU architecture limits us from adding more attributes or operations such as constraints, friction, sewing and complex interactive operation. We thus use the idea of parallel computation to normal CPU rather than GPU. Thanks to the powerful CPU instructions, many interactive operations can now be embedded in our real-time systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Numerical solution</head><p>In clothing simulation, the computation of differential equations is usually one dominant part of the total computational costs. Upon deciding the physical model, a suitable numerical integration method must be selected. There are mainly two kinds of integration method: explicit and implicit integration (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref> for comprehensive surveys). Explicit integration schemes, like the Euler or Runge-Kutta methods, are fast and easy to implement, but small time steps are necessary to maintain the system's stability and congruence. On the other hand, implicit integration methods allow the use of larger time steps but require a lot more computation at every step. In our system we use another integration scheme, called the Stoermer-Verlet method, which is mostly used in game development <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>. The method is simple, fast, relatively stable and suitable for interactive use.</p><p>By the Stoermer-Verlet method, each particle has two main variables: its position p and velocity p . In each time step the new position and velocity are computed by Newton's law f = ma (where f is the force acting on the particle). In order to provide accurate draping results, the end position of each particle is determined by its gravity and other forces acting on it, including interaction and external forces. By omitting velocity from the equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p (t) = f p (t, p(t), p (t))<label>(7)</label></formula><p>becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p (t) = f p (t, p(t)).<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Therefore, the new position of the particle can be calculated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">p n+1 = p n + (p n -p n-1 ) t 2 f p (p n ).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>This integration scheme is especially efficient if the mechanical systems are given as second order ordinary differential equations. We omit velocity in the dynamic equation. As result of this, it may not be precise enough for dynamic animation but it is efficient for obtaining accurate final drape results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Experimental results and discussion</head><p>We demonstrate in this section our interactive virtual try-on systems by simulating real production garment patterns on two human models. Four garment types, including an eight-panel skirt, a pair of trousers, a wawa style blouse and a standing collar blouse, were developed for simulation (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">11</ref>). These garment patterns were developed as true scale production patterns by a standard pattern design system (PDS), and the patterns can be used for actual production. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the pattern pieces of the standing collar blouse and the trousers. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> lists the pattern and seam information of the four garments. The pattern and seam information were provided to the simulation engine for virtual tryon and drape simulation.   We used two human models for the simulation, one is a standard woman model developed by MakeHuman software and the other one is a girl model obtained from 3D scanning. The woman model consists of 11,222 vertices and 21,966 triangles, while the girl model consists of 14,976 vertices and 29,948 triangles, respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref> shows the process of a virtual try-on of the wawa blouse on the girl model. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref> shows the results of trying a pair of trousers on the standard woman model. Our results were generated using bounding ellipsoids and an accurate collision scheme on the human models. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">14</ref> compares our simulation results with the real sample garment. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">15</ref> shows the final drape results of the four garments. It is shown that our systems can try on complex garments and generate realistic simulations. Finally, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarizes the simulation performance of the virtual tryon system using a desktop PC and an average laptop.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusions and future work</head><p>We have presented a novel approach to realize real-time virtual try-on of garments by user interaction. Our method is physicalbased, both in the stage of pre-positioning and of final draping. A hierarchy of ellipsoids has been employed for accelerating the cloth simulation. A friction model has been proposed to produce realistic final drape results. Four types of manipulation have been defined for user interaction in order to achieve multi-sewing of complex styles. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness  and efficiency of the proposed system, and it will help the clothing industry to speed up the fashion product development processes.</p><p>To improve the speed of simulation, self-collision is prevented by checking the distance between two particles in our current systems. A more stable and robust self-collision detection scheme will be employed in our future work, because it helps in exploring more complex operations during the stage of pre-positioning and design modification. Based on the work have done so far, we are now working on including more complex fashion design operations, for instance adding buttons/darts and changing pattern parameters in 3D space for real-time style modification. In addition, transforming the human model's posture is also under investigation because it helps designers to evaluate garment fit with different postures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
