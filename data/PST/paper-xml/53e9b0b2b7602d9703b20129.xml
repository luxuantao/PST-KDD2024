<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>W ITH the popularity of cloud computing [2], more and more data centers are envisioned to be built in the future in order to meet the growing demand for large-scale computing resources. It is common for a cloud service provider to have multiple data centers each having hundreds of thousands of servers. Those data centers are geographically distributed for reliability as well as performance improvement. A critical issue in the operations of those data centers is the energy consumption, including both servers and air conditioners. According to the estimation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, large companies such as Google and Microsoft pay tens of millions of dollars for just electricity usage every year, and 30-50 percent percentage of operational expenses in data centers come from electricity. Therefore, minimizing the electricity cost is receiving more and more attention. However, saving electricity cost and improving performance are usually in conflict with each other; thus, joint optimization is needed.</p><p>A natural way to reduce electricity cost is to conserve energy consumption or to improve the energy efficiency such that the same amount of workload can be served with less energy. Note that in large-scale data centers, computing equipments generally exhibit high power intensity with all of its consumed electric power converted to heat. In order to ensure the reliable operation of data centers, air conditioning is required to extract the heat dissipated by the IT computing devices. Thus, additional power is required to operate the cooling system. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which measures the ratio of total building power to IT power, i.e., the power consumed by the actual computing equipment, is used to judge the energy efficiency of a data center. It is reported that PUE is nearly 2 for typical data centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Various engineering techniques such as advanced cooling, virtualization, direct current (DC) power, multicore servers, etc., have been employed to improve the PUE.</p><p>On the other hand, more and more electricity markets are undergoing deregulation where the electricity market operators offer dynamic electricity rates to large industrial and commercial customers instead of traditional flat rates at the retail level. Therefore, minimization of electricity consumption does not necessarily translate into that of the electricity cost since the cost should be the price times the energy amount. Geographical load balancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> has been proposed to utilize the variation of electricity prices in wholesale electricity markets so as to provide significant cost savings for data centers. The basic idea is to route more traffic to data centers where the electricity price is lower. Although those techniques are effective in practice, a largely ignored factor is the existence of energy storage facilities within data centers, which can provide further cost saving if utilized intelligently in combination of the previous techniques. Comparing with existing techniques for power cost reduction, the method of energy storage has no performance degradation.</p><p>Data centers have uninterrupted power supply (UPS) units to keep them powered using stored energy in case of electric utility failure, which is their primary power source, before the backup diesel generation can start up and provide power as secondary power source. Usually, the transition to use diesel generation takes only 10-20 seconds while UPS units have enough capacity to power the data center at its maximum power need between 5-30 minutes. This excess energy storage capacity can be used to save the electricity cost by the simple intuition of charging when the electricity price is low while discharging when the electricity price is high in the utility grid.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of exploiting the UPS units within data centers to minimize the cloud service provider's electricity cost. We propose a joint load balancing, server configuration, and battery management scheme for multiple distributed data centers. Since the traffic arrivals and electricity prices are both random processes with possibly unknown statistics, the problem is formulated as a stochastic program and then, an efficient online algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is proposed to solve it.</p><p>Our contribution can be summarized as follows:</p><p>. We investigate the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost of multiple data centers for a cloud service provider under wholesale electricity markets by taking into account the batteries within these data centers. . We formulate the problem as a stochastic program, which captures the center-level load balancing, the server-level configuration, and the battery management while at the same time guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) experience by end users. . We propose an efficient online algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization technique to obtain the optimal joint load balancing, server configuration, and battery management scheme for the total electricity cost minimization. Moreover, our algorithm offers an explicit tradeoff between the cost saving and the battery capacity. . We evaluate our algorithm based on real-world data sets and the results show that our approach can achieve significant electricity cost saving. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some related studies in electricity cost reduction in data centers. Section 3 presents the models of electricity cost in multiple data centers, which is formulated as a stochastic program to minimize the time-average expected electricity cost. Section 4 solves the optimization problem by first considering a relaxed problem and then, using the Lyapunov optimization technique to design a control algorithm to approximately solve the original problem. Section 5 gives the algorithmic performance analysis and Section 6 gives the numerical evaluation results based on real-world data sets. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The huge energy consumption in data centers has motivated a lot of research to reduce the electricity cost in data centers. These studies can be roughly divided into two categories: one is from the perspective of hardware design and engineering; the other is from the perspective of algorithmic design.</p><p>In the first category, energy-efficient chips, multicore servers, DC power supplies, advanced cooling systems, and virtulization have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. These techniques have been used to improve the PUE for data centers (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for a survey on these issues).</p><p>In the second category, the research can be divided into the following three different levels. The first level is the server level, where only the power consumption of a single server is considered. A widely used technique is the dynamic voltage/ frequency scaling (DVFS), where the operating voltage and frequency of the server's CPU can be adjusted according to the intensity of the workload on the server. Since the first analytical study of DVFS by Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the scheduling and speed scaling algorithms to minimize the total energy used in order to meet job deadlines have been addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The objective of minimizing the average response time given an energy budget is addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, while the objective of minimizing a weighted combination of expected response time and energy usage per job is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>The second level is the data center level. Dynamic cluster server configuration (DCSC) has been proposed to optimally adjust the number of active servers in data centers while satisfying the QoS requirement for electricity cost reduction. Lin et al. propose a novel online algorithm for cost reduction to dynamically right size a data center, which is proven to be 3-competitive, while taking into account the switching cost during turning on/off servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The third level is the interdata center level, which is based on the observation that the electricity price is different across different time and locations under wholesale electricity markets. Qureshi et al. are the first to discuss the opportunity of utilizing such electricity price variation to reduce total electricity cost by distributing more traffic to data centers with low electricity price <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Rao et al. investigate the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost for data centers in a multielectricity-market environment subject to QoS guarantee and propose a linear programming formulation to approximately solve it <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These studies focus on directly reducing the total electricity cost by exploiting the spatial variation of electricity prices. However, none of the aforementioned work considers using available energy storage capabilities, typically UPS units, in data centers to further reduce the electricity cost.</p><p>Our work is mainly motivated by Urgaonkar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which considers the case of a single data center with energy storage for time-varying electricity price under a wholesale electricity market. The system implementation issue of using UPS units to help reduce electricity cost is analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Different from previous studies, our work considers the total electricity cost minimization of a cloud service provider having multiple data centers with energy storage under both time-varying and location-varying electricity prices. In our preliminary work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we assume that the server consumes a fixed amount of power when turned on and the battery cost is not considered. However, in this paper, we take into account the battery cost as well as realistic server power consumption model. Moreover, extensive numerical evaluation results based on real-world data sets are included in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MODEL AND FORMULATION</head><p>We now describe the models we use in this paper to minimize the time-average expected electricity cost in data centers. Assume the system is discrete time with time period matching the timescale at which traffic distribution, server configuration, and charging/discharging decisions can be updated (e.g., 10 min).</p><p>We consider a cloud service provider having N geographically distributed data centers, denoted by D ¼ fD 1 ; . . . ; D N g and K front-end proxy servers, denoted by S ¼ fS 1 ; . . . ; S K g. Each data center D i has a total number of M i homogeneous servers. The system operates in slotted period, i.e., t ¼ f0; 1; . . .g. The block diagram of our system model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, which is described in detail as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Workload Model</head><p>In every period t, customer requests arrive at each front-end proxy server. We denote the average arrival rate of workload at S j by A j ðtÞ, j 2 f1; . . . ; Kg, where AðtÞ ¼ ðA 1 ðtÞ; . . . ; A K ðtÞÞ denotes the traffic arrival vector. The workload arrival rate distributed from the front-end proxy server S j to the data center D i is denoted as ji ðtÞ. This can be done by dynamically generated DNS responses, HTTP redirections, or using persistent HTTP proxies to tunnel requests. We assume that there exists a proxy/DNS server colocated with each request source. Therefore, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X N i¼1 ji ðtÞ ¼ A j ðtÞ; 8j ¼ 1; . . . ; K:<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">ji ðtÞ ! 0:<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>Define the total arrival rate distributed to data center D i as i ðtÞ and the distributed workload vector as ðtÞ ¼ ð 1 ðtÞ; . . . ; N ðtÞÞ. Then, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">i ðtÞ ¼ X K j¼1 ji ðtÞ; 8i ¼ 1; . . . ; N:<label>ð3Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Battery Model</head><p>We assume that each data center possesses some kind of battery. For each data center D i , we denote by E i;max the battery capacity, by E i ðtÞ the energy level of the battery at period t, and by P i ðtÞ the power (energy per period) charged to (when P i ðtÞ &gt; 0) or discharged from (when P i ðtÞ &lt; 0) the battery during period t. Assume that the battery energy leakage is negligible and batteries at data centers operate independently of each other. Then, we model the dynamics of the battery energy level by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E i ðt þ 1Þ ¼ E i ðtÞ þ P i ðtÞ:<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>For each data center D i , the battery usually has an upper bound on the charge rate, denoted by P i;max , and an upper bound on the discharge rate, denoted by P i;min . P i;max and P i;min are positive constants depending on the physical property of the battery. Therefore, we have the following constraint on P i ðtÞ: À P i;min P i ðtÞ P i;max :</p><p>The battery energy level should be always nonnegative and cannot exceed the battery capacity. Therefore, in each time period t, we need to ensure that for each data center D i ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">0 E i ðtÞ E i;max :<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>From constraints (4), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>), and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>), we get the following equivalent constraints in each period t for data center D i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P i ðtÞ ! ÀminfP i;min ; E i ðtÞg;<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">P i ðtÞ minfP i;max ; E i;max À E i ðtÞg:<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>However, the cost of using battery cannot be ignored. In practice, there are limited times of charging/discharing cycles for each battery. Besides, conversion loss occurs both in charging and discharging processes. Stored energy is also subject to leakage with time. All these factors depend on how fast/much/often it is charged and discharged. Instead of modeling these factors exactly, we use an amortized cost C b (in unit of dollars) to model the impact of per charging or discharging operation on the battery during one period. Therefore, during one time period, an operating cost of C b is incurred whenever the battery is charging (P i ðtÞ &gt; 0) or discharging (P i ðtÞ &lt; 0).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The QoS Model</head><p>In practice, according to the service level agreement (SLA) between the service provider and customers, customer requests should have some kind of QoS requirements. In this paper, we use the average response time as the QoS metric. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we use an M=M=n queuing model to analyze the average response time in data center D i when the traffic arrival rate is i ðtÞ and there are m i ðtÞ active servers, each with service rate i ðtÞ. Note that m i ðtÞ is an integral variable and has the maximum value M i at each data center D i . Also, there exists the maximum service rate i;max for each server in data center D i . When there is traffic distributed into D i , using the results from queuing theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the average response time W i ðtÞ is 1 m i ðtÞ i ðtÞÀ i ðtÞ P Q where P Q is the queuing probability. Without loss of generality in a data center, we assume the servers are always busy if turned on. Hence, P Q ¼ 1 and W i ðtÞ ¼ 1 miðtÞiðtÞÀiðtÞ . To meet the QoS requirement of customers, the maximum average response time W i;max is imposed on each data center D i . Therefore, we have the following QoS constraints: </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">m i ðtÞ i ðtÞ À i ðtÞ ! 1 W i;max ; 8i ¼ 1; . . . ; N;<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">0 m i ðtÞ M i ; m i 2 IN; 8i ¼ 1; . . . ; N;<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">0 i ðtÞ i;max ; 8i ¼ 1; . . . ; N:<label>ð11Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">The Power Consumption Model</head><p>In each time period t, the normal power consumption H i ðtÞ, including the cooling energy consumption at each data center D i , by running m i ðtÞ servers at rate i ðtÞ can be approximated by the following formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">H i ðtÞ ¼ m i ðtÞ Á ð i i i ðtÞ þ i Þ Á PUE i ;<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>where i , i , i , and PUE i are constants determined by the data center D i . Specifically, i is the average idle power consumption of a server, and i i i ðtÞ þ i gives the power consumption of one server running at rate i ðtÞ at D i . PUE i is the ratio of the total building power (including cooling power) to IT server power, whose value lies between 1.3 and 2 in today's energy-efficient data centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Due to the introduction of energy storage, the total amount of energy G i ðtÞ drawn from the grid to supply the data center D i during time period t is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">G i ðtÞ ¼ H i ðtÞ þ P i ðtÞ; 8i ¼ 1; . . . ; N:<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>Specifically, when P i ðtÞ &gt; 0, some energy drawn from the grid is used to charge the battery besides serving the normal data center operation. When P i ðtÞ &lt; 0, some energy is discharged from the battery to supplement the energy drawn from the grid so as to meet the energy demand of the data center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">The Electricity Price Model</head><p>The electric power grid in US is organized into different reliability regions, where each region has its own regional transmission organization (RTO) or independent system operator (ISO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The RTO or ISO is a central authority that directs the flow of electricity between generators and consumers and ensures the reliability of the grid. It also operates wholesale electricity markets, which usually include day-ahead and real-time electricity markets. The electricity prices in these markets are determined by the clearing processes of supply and demand bids while satisfying the transmission constraints. As analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the electricity prices in wholesale electricity markets have both spatial and temporal variations. At each data center D i , we assume a time-varying electricity price C i ðtÞ with the maximum value C i;max and the minimum value C i;min , respectively. Denote CðtÞ ¼ ðC 1 ðtÞ; . . . ; C N ðtÞÞ as the electricity price vector and GðtÞ ¼ ðG 1 ðtÞ; . . . ; G N ðtÞÞ as the grid energy consumption vector. We further assume that CðtÞ and GðtÞ are independent. Different data centers may have different electricity prices at the same time due to being located in different electricity markets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">The Cost Minimization Problem with Energy Storage</head><p>As discussed before, the total electricity cost of N data centers during time period t is given by the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">X N i¼1 fG i ðtÞC i ðtÞ þ 1 fP i ðtÞ6 ¼0g C b g:<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>In this paper, we are interested in choosing the following three control decisions to minimize the long-term timeaverage expected electricity cost: 1) the workload distributed from the front-end web portals to different data centers-ðtÞ; 2) the number of active servers at different data centers-mðtÞ and the corresponding service rates-ðtÞ;</p><p>3) the charge/discharge rate at different data centers-PðtÞ.</p><p>Based on the models above, our problem can be formulated as the following stochastic program, called P1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">min lim sup T !1 1 T X T À1 t¼0 X N i¼1 IEfG i ðtÞC i ðtÞ þ 1 fP i ðtÞ6 ¼0g C b g;</formula><p>subject to constraints (1), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">10</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, where the constraints are for each time period t and data center D i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PROPOSED SOLUTION</head><p>One challenge of solving the stochastic optimization problem above is the unawareness of future workload arrivals as well as time-varying and location-varying electricity prices. Moreover, the constraints on E i ðtÞ bring the "time-coupling" property to the stochastic optimization problem above. It means that the current control action may impact the future control actions, making it more challenging to solve. As mentioned before, the statistics of AðtÞ and CðtÞ may not be known and we need to design an optimal control algorithm under uncertainty. We use the recently developed technique of Lyapunov optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The algorithm we propose can achieve the range of Oð1=V Þ within the optimal objective value, where V is a parameter related to the battery capacity of each data center D i . One salient feature of our algorithm is that it does not need any future knowledge of the system and can be easily implemented online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Relaxed Problem</head><p>Before giving the solution to our original problem P1, we consider a relaxed problem. Define the time-average expected value of charge or discharge rate at data center D i under any feasible control policy of P1 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P i ¼ lim sup T !1 1 T X T À1 t¼0 IEfP i ðtÞg:<label>ð15Þ</label></formula><p>Since the battery energy level is evolving according to (4), summing over all t 2 f0; 1; 2; . . . ; T À 1g, and taking expectation of both sides, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">IEfE i ðT Þg À E i;ini ¼ X T À1 t¼0 IEfP i ðtÞg;</formula><p>where E i;ini ¼ E i ð0Þ is the initial battery energy level at data center D i . As 0 E i ðtÞ E i;max for all time periods t, dividing both sides by T , and taking T ! 1 yields P i ¼ 0. Hence, we have the following relaxed problem, called P2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">min lim sup T !1 1 T X T À1 t¼0 X N i¼1 IEfG i ðtÞC i ðtÞ þ 1 fP i ðtÞ6 ¼0g C b g;</formula><p>subject to constraints (1), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">10</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">11</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">13</ref>), and</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">P i ¼ 0;</formula><p>where the constraints are for each time period t and data center D i . Denote the optimal objective value of P1 as Q OP T and the optimal objective value of P2 as Q REL . As discussed before, any feasible solution to P1 is also a feasible solution to P2. Hence, Q REL Q OP T . Note that P2 is a decoupled control problem since no correlation exists in any constraint. From the framework of Lyapunov optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we have the following theorem for the solution to P2: Theorem 1. If CðtÞ and AðtÞ are i.i.d. over slots, then there exists a stationary, randomized policy that takes control decisions stat ðtÞ, m stat ðtÞ, stat ðtÞ, and P stat ðtÞ every period purely as a function (possibly randomized) of the current workload vector AðtÞ and the electricity price vector CðtÞ while satisfying the constraints of P2 and providing the following guarantees:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">IEfP stat i ðtÞg ¼ 0; IE X N i¼1 Â G stat i ðtÞC i ðtÞ þ 1 fP stat i ðtÞ6 ¼0g C b Ã ( ) ¼ Q REL ;</formula><p>where the expectations above are with respect to the stationary distributions of AðtÞ, CðtÞ, and the randomized control decisions.</p><p>Proof.

Moreover, this control policy may not be a feasible solution to P1.

The optimal solution to P3 has the following properties:</p><p>1. If S i ðtÞ &gt; ÀV C i;min , the optimal solution always choose P Ã i ðtÞ 0. 2. If S i ðtÞ &lt; ÀV C i;max , the optimal solution always choose P Ã i ðtÞ ! 0.</p><p>Proof. For each data center D i and time period t, 1. When S i ðtÞ &gt; ÀV C i;min , suppose P Ã i ðtÞ &gt; 0, then we have G Ã i ðtÞ &gt; m Ã i ðtÞH Ã i ðtÞ. According to the objective of P3, in this case, the value of the objective should always be larger than the case that P i ðtÞ ¼ 0 and G i ðtÞ ¼ m Ã i ðtÞH Ã i ðtÞ where m Ã i ðtÞ and H Ã i ðtÞ do not change. This results in the contradiction because our algorithm is always trying to minimize the objective function. Hence, when S i ðtÞ &gt; ÀV C min , P i ðtÞ cannot be strictly greater than zero, i.e., the battery would not charge. 2. When S i ðtÞ &lt; ÀV C i;max , suppose P Ã i ðtÞ &lt; 0, then we have G Ã i ðtÞ &lt; m Ã i ðtÞH Ã i ðtÞ. Similarly, according to the objective of P3, in this case, the value of the objective should be always larger than the case that P i ðtÞ ¼ 0 and G i ðtÞ ¼ m Ã i ðtÞH Ã i ðtÞ where m Ã i ðtÞ and H Ã i ðtÞ do not change. This results in the contradiction because our algorithm is always trying to minimize the objective function. Hence, when S i ðtÞ &lt; ÀV C i;max , P i ðtÞ cannot be strictly less than zero, i.e., the battery would not discharge.</p><p>t u</p><p>Then, we have the following theorem about the algorithmic performance of our proposed algorithm: Theorem 2.

We prove in the following that this constraint is satisfied for all periods by induction.

As the constraint on E i ðtÞ for each data center D i is satisfied as shown in 1 and we make our decisions to satisfy all constraints in P3, combining them together, all constraints of P1 are satisfied. Therefore, our control decisions are feasible to P1. 3. As we mentioned before, our algorithm is always trying to greedily minimize the R.H.S. of the upper bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> of the drift-plus-penalty term at each period t over all possible feasible control policies including the optimal, stationary policy given in Theorem 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">NUMERICAL EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm based on real-world workload and electricity price data sets. To reduce the overhead between switching the servers on/off across different time periods, the scheduling horizon is divided into discrete time periods with 10 min at each period. We consider a request-response type of cloud service. To accommodate other kinds of typical cloud services such as batch computing and sessionbased application, only minor modifications need to be made for the traffic distribution constrains and application QoS requirements in our model. We first describe the realworld data sets and system parameters used in this paper. Then, we illustrate the improved energy cost saving of our scheme in comparison with some benchmark schemes. The performance changes due to different battery capacities, battery cost, and QoS requirements are also analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>For the purpose of illustration, we consider several simulated data centers where the multiple front-end proxy servers are merged into one. The front-end proxy server acts as a load balancer which receives the incoming traffic requests and distributes workload to different data centers in different locations. It is also responsible for sending control decisions to back-end servers to configure the servers and manage the battery charging/discharging operation. Four different data centers, each having a battery, at different geographic locations are assumed in this evaluation. Electricity price data. We use the 5-min locational marginal prices (LMP) in real-time electricity markets at four different locations: Chicago, New York, Palo Alto, CA and Houston, TX that host Google's data centers. The data set is obtained from the publicly available government sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>. Based on this raw data, we calculate the average electricity price over disjoint 10 minute intervals. The time horizon we consider in this paper is from January 1 to January 21, 2011. In total, this duration includes three weeks or 3,024 10-min periods. A portion of the average 10-min real-time electricity prices during the first week of January 2011 at the four different locations is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The electricity price is in unit of $/MWh.</p><p>Workload data. The real-world workload data we use in the evaluations are a set of I/O traces taken from six RAID volumes at MSR Cambridge <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. The original traced period is only one week and we repeat it to get a three-week workload traces. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the request number variations in different 10-min periods for three days. The peak-toaverage ratio of the workload is 4.5.</p><p>System parameters. We assume that the servers at one location are homogeneous. Note that our model is quite general and can be easily extended into the heterogenous case with only additional notations. The server parameters at each locations are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, where the service rate (in unit of requests per second) is estimated by the Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. 10-min average real-time electricity prices in 3 hours at four locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>.

We choose PUE i ¼ 1:3 in all our evaluations to get a conservative estimate of the cost savings. The delay constraint at each data center is chosen to be 1 ms, i.e., W i;max ¼ 0:001 s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Performance Evaluation</head><p>In order to analyze the performance improvement due to our scheme, we compare it with the following schemes that either represent the current practice in data center power management or are the state-of-the-art techniques proposed by previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>: 1) Static load balancing (SLB): current data centers usually runs a constant number of servers to serve the workload. In order to satisfy the timevarying demand, data centers usually overly provision and keep more running servers than what is needed to meet the peak load. In the evaluation, we assume that the data center has complete workload information ahead of time and provisions exactly to satisfy the peak load. Moreover, the amount of workload routed to different data centers is proportional to the service capacity of data centers regardless of electricity price. We assume that all servers are activated at all times. However, the service rates of the servers can be adjusted in every period; 2) Price-aware load balancing (PLB): the scheme is similar to the heuristic proposed by Qureshi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> that routes more jobs to data centers with lower electricity price. In the evaluation, we assume that the workload is first routed to the data center with the lowest electricity price. Then, we route the remaining workload to the data center with the second lowest price, and so on. Again, all servers are assumed to be activated at all times and service rates can be tuned in every period; 3) Price-aware dynamic provisioning (PDP): this scheme is proposed by Rao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which consider both traffic routing and dynamic server provisioning to exploit the spatial variation of electricity price in real-time electricity markets. However, energy storage facilities in data centers are not considered in these work. Therefore, the temporal variation of electricity prices is not utilized.</p><p>In the first evaluation, we compare our algorithm with the three benchmark schemes above using the real-world traces. Note that the performance of our scheme depends on the battery capacity and the battery cost. We choose C b ¼ 0:1 $ and E i;max ¼ 300 kWh. The maximum charge and discharge rate are set to be P i;max ¼ P i;min ¼ 10 kWh. The initial battery energy level at each data center is chosen to be zero, i.e., E i;ini ¼ 0. Let V ¼ V max . The result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4a</ref>. From the figure, we can see that both our scheme and the PDP can get much better performance than the SLB and the PLB because of turning off unnecessary servers rather than leaving them idle. Also, our scheme performs better than the PDP because of the introduction of energy storage, which can charge when the price is low while discharging when the price is high. In the following, we consider the impact of individual parameters on the performance of our scheme compared to the PDP.</p><p>Impact of battery capacity. In this evaluation, we vary the battery capacities of data centers with other parameters fixed. We set E i;max ¼ f300; 400; 500g kWh and V ¼ V max . The result is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4b</ref>. From the figure, it is clear that the larger the battery is, the more cost saving our proposed algorithm can obtain, which coincides with the algorithmic performance results of our algorithm in Theorem 2. As we have mentioned before, the saving comes from the fact that our algorithm would charge the battery when the electricity price is low while discharging it when the electricity price is low.</p><p>Impact of battery cost. Currently, the battery is still expansive. The charging or discharging operation would reduce the lifetime of the battery. However, it is expected that the cost of battery would decrease greatly in the next decade. In this evaluation, we estimate the impact of battery cost on the cost saving of our algorithm. We set C b ¼ f0:1; 1; 10; 100g $ and keep E i;max ¼ 300 kWh fixed. The result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4c</ref>. Note that when the battery cost per operation is very large (e.g., 100 $), our algorithm would not charge or discharge the battery at all, so it is the same as the scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. As the battery cost increases, the total cost saving compared with PDP would decrease since the opportunity to utilize the temporal variation of electricity prices is smaller.</p><p>Impact of QoS requirement. In this setting, we adjust the QoS requirements of customer requests while fixing other parameters to see the impact of QoS requirement on the performance of our scheme. We choose W i;max ¼ f0:001; 0:005; 0:01; 0:05g s. As observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4d</ref>, the increase of the maximum average response time gives more opportunity to optimize the energy cost, since fewer number of servers needs to be turned on to serve the same amount of workload.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we apply the Lyapunov optimization technique to solve the problem of optimal traffic distribution, server configuration, and battery management in data centers for location-varying and time-varying electricity prices under wholesale electricity markets. The algorithm we propose matches the intuition of distributing more traffic into data centers with lower electricity price and charging when electricity price is low while discharging when electricity price is high. Moreover, it is easy to implement online and can give analytic bound on the performance. With the increase of battery capacity, our algorithm can get arbitrarily close to the optimal value. Numerical evaluations based on real-world traces show that our algorithm can result in significant energy cost reduction without scarifying the customer QoS requirements.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
