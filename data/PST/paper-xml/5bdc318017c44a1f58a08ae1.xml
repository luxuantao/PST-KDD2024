<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) research has attracted a lot of attention during the last decade. This interest is mainly given by the low cost of this type of vehicles and its large application range in diverse areas as: security, surveillance, video and film production, delivery, health, maintenance, transportation, etc. Between all these UAVs, the Quad-Rotors are considered as the most used vehicles due to its useful flight modes, its simplicity of operation and variety of sizes.</p><p>Despite the fact that the literature related to control design of Quad-Rotors is extensive, in this introduction the robust tracking control problem is the main focus. In this vein, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> a closed-form control scheme is proposed to track a desired trajectory in a Quad-Rotor under uncertainties providing stabilization and tracking in a practical sense. A switching model predictive controller is designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for achieving a precise trajectory under the presence of forcible wind gusts. The</p><p>The authors thank the financial support from CONACYT 270504, 785635, 817174, project 134534 and from TECNM projects.</p><p>H.

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> a disturbance Sliding-Mode Observer (SMO) approach is proposed to design a robust flight controller for a Quad-Rotor in the presence of unknown disturbances. In the same context of Sliding-Mode Control (SMC) theory, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> a Super-Twisting algorithm (STA) is presented for the attitude tracking control problem of a Quad-Rotor ensuring robustness with respect to external disturbances but acting only on the attitude dynamics. A direct and indirect model reference adaptive control, that mitigates the effects of a loss of thrust anomaly, is provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for a Quad-Rotor. A second-order SMC approach is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to exponentially solve the position and attitude tracking problem for a Quad-Rotor. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> a real-time robust altitude control scheme is provided for an efficient performance of a Quad-Rotor using a chattering-free SMC approach. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> a nonlinear control method, based on integral backstepping and saturationbased SMC, is presented to stabilize the Quad-Rotor attitude and to reach a trajectory tracking task. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> a combination between a Proportional-Derivative controller and a Laplacebased compensator is proposed for robust attitude control of Quad-Rotors under some uncertainties. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> a block control technique, combined with the STA and robustified with a wind identification algorithm, is provided to solve the tracking trajectory problem for a Quad-Rotor affected by wind. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> an integral predictive robust control together with a nonlinear H ∞ controller are proposed to track a desired trajectory in a Quad-Rotor. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> a discontinuous modelfree-based terminal SMC is presented to control the attitude and position of a Quad-Rotor in a finite time and despite some uncertainties. Nevertheless, it presents the disadvantage of being discontinuous, as most of the SMCs previously proposed to solve the tracking control problem in a Quad-Rotor system. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, an observer-based control scheme is presented based on disturbance force and torque estimation. It is shown that the proposed control strategy guarantees asymptotic stability of the tracking error. In the same vein, a robust cascade controller is presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> based on a robust compensation-based hierarchical control scheme for Quad-Rotors with multiple uncertainties and multiple delays. Such a scheme provides a bounded tracking error. On the other hand, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> a robust control strategy, based on a continuous SMC algorithm and a hierarchical approach, is provided to robustly track a desired trajectory exponentially for a Quad-Rotor despite some class of disturbances acting on the system. An asymptotic tracking controller for a Quad-Rotor is proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> using an immersion and invariance-based adaptive control together with a robust integral of the sign of the error-based controller. It is evident that the robust tracking control problem for Quad-Rotors still remains as an important and challenging problem due to the difficulty of robust control design and robust stability analysis. Moreover, it is very important to highlight that most of the works provide a bounded tracking error for disturbances acting on all the Quad-Rotor dynamics; or an asymptotic convergence to zero of the tracking error for disturbances acting on some of the Quad-Rotor dynamics.</p><p>Motivated by the aforementioned difficulties, in this paper a continuous robust tracking output-control strategy is proposed for a Quad-Rotor under the influence of external disturbances and uncertainties acting on all the Quad-Rotor dynamics. The proposed strategy is composed of a FT-SMO, that estimates and identifies the full state, from the measurable position and attitude, and some type of disturbances, respectively; and also of a combination between PID controllers and three different Continuous-SMCs, that robustly track a desired timevarying trajectory with exponential convergence and despite the influence of external disturbances and uncertainties acting on all the Quad-Rotor dynamics <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . The closed-loop stability is provided based on ISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and FT-ISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> properties that ensure the exponential convergence to zero of the tracking error dynamics. It is well-known that to guarantee the closedloop stability for an underactuated system, as the Quad-Rotor, is not straightforward. Some experimental results validate the provided control strategy. It is worth mentioning that the strategy is completely continuous and it has not been tested before in a Quad-Rotor system.</p><p>The outline of this work is as follows. The problem statement is introduced in Section II. Some preliminary definitions are given in Section III. The robust tracking control strategy and the main result are described in Section IV. The corresponding experimental resua combination between PID controllers and Continuous Sliding-Modes Controllers (Continuous-SMCs)lts are depicted in Section V. Some concluding remarks are discussed in Section VI. Finally, some preliminary results and the proofs for the main results are given in the Appendix.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Notation: Denote R + = {x ∈ R : x ≥ 0},</formula></div>

Control Design</head><p>In this section, a combination between PID controllers (for the virtual controllers) and three different Continuous-SMCs (for the main thrust and moments) is proposed. Define the desired trajectories as x d , y d , z d , ψ d ∈ C ∞ and bounded. Then, the tracking error vectors can be given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">e ξ = (ex, ey, ez) T := ξ1 -ξ d , eη = (e θ , e φ , e ψ ) T := η1 -η d , ε ξ = (εx, εy, εz) T := ξ2 -ξd , εη = (ε θ , ε φ , ε ψ ) T := η2 -ηd , where ξ d := (x d , y d , z d ) T ∈ R 3 and η d := (θ , φ , ψ d ) T ∈ R 3</formula><p>are the desired position and attitude vectors, respectively; with θ and φ being some reference signals to be designed. Then, the tracking error dynamics is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ėξ = ε ξ , εξ = g ξ (η 1 )u m -G + d ξ (t) -ξd , (6a) ėη = ε η , εη = τ + d η (t) -ηd ,<label>(6b)</label></formula><p>with initial conditions e ξ0 := e ξ (0) ∈ R 3 , ε ξ0 := ε ξ (0) ∈ R 3 , e η0 := e η (0) ∈ R 3 and ε η0 := ε η (0) ∈ R 3 . Note that, due to the under-actuated nature of the Quad-Rotor, one cannot control all the positions and angles independently. Hence, the references signals θ and φ as well as the control input u m and τ must be properly designed in order to achieve a desired position ξ d and a desired angle ψ d . To do this, a virtual control ν := (ν x , ν y , ν z ) T ∈ R 3 is introduced in the position error dynamics, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ėξ = ε ξ , εξ = ν + w ξ (η 1 , u m , ν) + d ξ -ξd , (7a) ėη = ε η , εη = τ + d η (t) -ηd ,<label>(7b)</label></formula><p>where the disturbance term w ξ ∈ R 3 is given as w ξ (η1, um, ν) = (wx, wy, wz) := g ξ (η1)um -G -ν. Thus, the virtual control ν may be chosen as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> νx = um(sφ sψ d + sθ cφ cψ d ), (8a)</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">νy = um(sθ cφ sψ d -sφ cψ d ), (8b) νz = umcθ cφ -g,<label>(8c)</label></formula><p>and then, calculate the main thrust u m and the references signals θ and φ from (8), i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">um = ν 2 x + ν 2 y + (νz + g) 2 ,<label>(9a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">θ = arcsin[u -1 m (νxsψ d -νycψ d )],<label>(9b)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">φ = arctan[(νz + g) -1 (νxcψ d + νysψ d )].<label>(9c)</label></formula><p>Therefore, the objective now is to design the virtual controller ν and the control input τ such that the tracking error vector e := (e ξ , ε ξ , e η , ε η ) T ∈ R 12 converges to zero despite some bounded uncertainties and disturbances.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>The proposed control strategy is applied to the QBall2 by Quanser depicted by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. This research experimental platform uses a ground control station with the real-time control software QUARC , that allows to create a direct interface with MATLAB /Simulink . The QBall2 position and attitude are tracked and accurately measured using a OptiTrack TM camera system with six synchronized infrared cameras connected to the ground station.</p><p>The FT-SMO ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">4</ref>) and the continuous robust control ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">9</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">15</ref>), with νz , τθ , τφ , τψ designed as Continuous-STSMCs, are implemented in MATLAB /Simulink . The parameters for the FT-SMO and the continuous robust control are given in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref>. Recall that the control strategy uses the estimated velocities provided by the FT-SMO. In this case the Quad-Rotor is dealing with a regulation task where the desired trajectories x d and y d are just piece-wise continuous in order to better illustrate the workability of the proposed control strategy. The results are depicted by Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure">3</ref>. The corresponding desired trajectory and the real position and attitude tracked by the QBall2 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. It is clear that the QBall2 tracks the desired trajectory with a good precision despite the intrinsic disturbances of the system and taking into account that a very simple model was considered for the control design. On the other hand, the control signals are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>The second desired trajectory (tracking task) was designed as ψ d (t) = 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">x d (t) = y d (t) = 0, if t ∈ [0s, 55s), 0.3 cos(πt/6), if t ∈ [55s, 120s], z d (t) =      0.5, if t ∈ [0s, 42s], 0.7, if t ∈ (42s, 87s], 0.8, if t ∈ (87s, 120s].</formula><p>For this case the Quad-Rotor is dealing with a tracking task where the desired trajectories x d , y d and z d are also piecewise continuous.

The proposed desired trajectory and the real position and attitude tracked by the QBall2 are depicted by Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Once again, the QBall2 tracks the desired trajectory with a good precision in spite of model uncertainties of the system. On the other hand, the control signals are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Due to space limitation, comparisons with other robust control strategies are out of the scope of this paper. The proper and fair comparisons (e.g. analysis of the convergence time, steady state error, RMS values, maximum tracking error, etc.) are postponed to other publication highlighting that this work is only focused on the presentation of this new Continuous-SMC strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper deals with the robust tracking output-control problem for a Quad-Rotor under the influence of external disturbances and uncertainties. The proposed robust strategy is composed of a FT-SMO, that estimates and identifies the full state, from the measurable position and attitude, and some type of disturbances, respectively; and also of a combination between PID controllers and three different Continuous-SMCs, that robustly track a desired time-varying trajectory with exponential convergence and despite the influence of external disturbances and uncertainties. The closed-loop stability is provided based on ISS and FT-ISS properties that ensure the exponential convergence to zero of the tracking error dynamics. Theoretically speaking, the proposed control strategy, using any of the proposed Continuous-SMCs (STSMC, NTSMC or TC), provides the same result, i.e. Global Uniform Exponential Stability of the tracking error. The experimental results validate the performance of the proposed control strategy using the Continuous-STSMCs. It is clear that, due to the lack of space, a formal and proper comparison experimental study of the different Continuous-SMCs is postponed. However, these issues are in the scope for future work as well as the control design considering communication delays that clearly appear in the QBall2 real-time application.</p></div>

For all x ∈ R n , its Euclidean norm ||x|| is related with the homogeneous one <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> as α r (||x|| r ) ≤ ||x|| ≤ α r (||x|| r ), for some α r , α r ∈ K ∞ . Due to this "equivalence", stability analysis with respect to the norm ||x|| may be substituted with analysis for the norm ||x|| r . The homogeneous norm has an important property that is ||Λ r (λ)x|| r = λ||x|| r for all x ∈ R n . Define S r = {x ∈ R n : ||x|| r = 1}. Definition 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.

Let us denote an extended discontinuous function F (x, d) = (F T (x, d), 0 m ) T . Theorem 5. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Let F be homogeneous with weights r = (r 1 , . . . , r n ) &gt; 0 and r = (r 1 , . . . , rm ) ≥ 0 with a degree q ≥ -min 1≤i≤n r i , i.e. F (Λ r x, Λ r d) = λ q Λ r F (x, d).

Then, the system (18) is ISS if rmin &gt; 0, where rmin = min 1≤j≤m rj . If the homogeneity degree q &lt; 0, then the system (18) is FT-ISS.</p><p>After these preliminary results, everything is ready to provide the proofs of Theorem 2 and 3, respectively.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 2. Firstly, let us prove that the tracking error dynamics for z is FT-ISS with respect to e η when the 0278-0046 (c) 2018 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.  Continuous-STSMC (12) is applied. Then, the tracking error dynamics for z is given as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">ėz = εz, εz = v -kz 2 sz 1 2 + wz,<label>(19a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_39">v = -kz 3 sz 0 ,<label>(19b)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">s z = ε z + k z1 e z 2 3</formula><p>. Define the following set-valued map</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">F ( z , v, w z ) = F ( z , v, wz) 0 =   εz v -kz 2 sz 1 2 + wz -kz 3 sz 0 0   ,</formula><p>with z := (e z , ε z ) T ∈ R 2 . This discontinuous function is homogeneous of degree q z = -1 with weights r z = (3, 2, 1) and rwz = 1. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, it has been proven that, for w z = 0, the quadratic form</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">V z = ζ T P z ζ, with ζ T = ( e z 2 3</formula><p>s z v 2 ) and some 0 &lt; P T z = P z ∈ R 3×3 , is a Lyapunov function for system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> such that, for some zi , i = 1, 3, Vz ≤ -κ z V 3/4 z , with some positive κ z . Therefore, at</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">( z , v) = 0, system (19) is GUFTS. Moreover, it is given that ||F ( z , v, wz) -F ( z , v, 0)|| = ||wz|| ≤ Lz||eη||, Lz||eη|| ≤ σ(||eη||), ∀ez, εz, v ∈ R,</formula><p>with σ(s) = cs ρmin , if s ≤ 1; or σ(s) = cs ρmax , if s &gt; 1, for c ≥ L z and ρ max = ρ min = 1. Hence, all the conditions of Theorem 1 hold, and due to min rwz = 1 &gt; 0, system ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_38">19</ref>) is FT-ISS<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> with respect to e η , i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">z (t, z (0), v, eη) v(t, z , v(0), eη) ≤ βz z (0) v(0) , t + γz(||eη||∞),<label>(20)</label></formula><p>for all t ≥ 0 and some β z ∈ KL T and γ z ∈ K.</p><p>Let us prove now that the tracking error for x coordinate is ISS with respect to e η . Therefore, if ν x is designed as in (8a), the tracking error dynamics for x is given as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">˙ x = (A + BKx) x + Bwx,<label>(21)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_46">A := 0 2×1 I 2 0 0 1×2 , B := 0 2×1 1 ,</formula><p>where x := (ē x , e x , ε x ) T ∈ R 3 and K</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">x := (k x0 , k x1 , k x2 ) ∈ R 1×3</formula><p>. Due to the fact that the pair (A, B) is controllable, there always exists a matrix K x such that A + BK x is Hurwitz. Therefore, one may use any classic linear control technique, e.g. pole-placement, LQR, LMI approaches, etc., to design the matrix K x and show that, for w x = 0, at the steady state = 0, system (21) is UES.  Then, since ||w x || ∞ ≤ L x ||e η || ∞ , for all x ∈ R and some L x &gt; 0, one can easily show that system (21) is ISS with respect to e η . In order to conclude the proof, one can follows the same previous steps to demonstrate that the tracking error for y coordinate is also ISS with respect to e η . Proof of Theorem 3. Let us prove that the tracking error dynamics for θ is GUFTS when the Continuous-TC (14) is applied.

This implies that, at (e θ , ε θ , v) = 0, system is (22) GUFTS.</p><p>Then, let us show that the tracking error dynamics for φ is GUFTS when the Continuous-NTSMC (13) is used. The closed-loop dynamics for φ is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">ėφ = ε φ , εφ = v -k φ 2 s φ 1 3 , (23a) v = -k φ 3 s φ 0 - ... φ ,<label>(23b)</label></formula><p>where s φ = ε φ + k φ1 e φ 3 2 and v := v -φ . One can show that system (23) is also homogeneous of degree φ = -1 with weights r φ = (3, 2, 1). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, it is shown that there exist coefficients β j , with j = 1, 2, such that the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">V φ (e φ , ε φ , v) = β1|e φ | 5 3 + e φ ε φ + 2 5 k φ 1 |ε φ | 5 2 -1 k 3 φ 1 ε φ v3 + β2|v| 5 ,</formula><p>is a Lyapunov function for system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> and that for k φj , with j = 1, 3, being selected as in Table <ref type="table">II</ref> assuming that || ... φ || ∞ ≤ ζ, its derivative satisfies Vφ ≤ -κ φ V 4/5 φ , with some positive κ φ . Thus, this implies that, at (e φ , ε φ , v) = 0, system (23) is also GUFTS <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> .</p><p>It is clear that the closed-loop dynamics for ψ presents the same structure as <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1" xml:id="foot_0"><p>In our previous work<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, a similar control strategy has been presented. However, only one Continuous-SMC was proposed, the stability analysis was not carried out using ISS properties and just simulation results were provided.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2" xml:id="foot_1"><p>In the classic SMC approach, such uncertainties and disturbances are only assumed uniformly bounded but the control law is discontinuous. In order to have a continuous and robust control law, a smaller class of uncertainties and disturbances is considered. However, it is worth saying that positions, angles, velocities and accelerations as well as the control inputs are physically bounded in practice; and the possible external disturbances, as wind gusts, are modeled most of the times as sinusoidal signals which are clearly bounded and Lipschitz continuous.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="foot_2"><p>It is possible to show that the tracking error dynamics for when the Continuous-NTSMC and Continuous-TC are applied, is also homogeneous of degree qz = -1 with weights rz = (3, 2, 1). Thus, one can prove, for each case, that system (19) is FT-ISS following the same given steps.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4" xml:id="foot_3"><p>In general, the boundedness conditions over θ and φ could be restrictive. However, if the Quad-Rotor is not going to deal with aggressive maneuvers, such boundedness conditions can always be satisfied. This consideration is taken into account in this paper.</p></note>
