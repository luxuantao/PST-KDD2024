<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">I n t r o d u c t i o n</head><p>The interpretation of static, monocular grey-valued images is usually based on the hypothesis that the loci of strong intensity variation are tightly coupled to physical events such as 3D discontinuities (foreground/background) or changes of surface orientation. However, the corresponding intensity variations normally differ from ideal edges. They often have complex profiles and may not be perfectly straight. Therefore, edge detection has to be a truly 2D process and linear operators based on idealized edge-models (e.g. Canny <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) seem to be inadequate for detecting complex intensity distributions.</p><p>Perona &amp; Malik <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> have pointed out that, in general, linear operators cannot detect and localize correctly edges and lines simultaneously. This problem becomes relevant in real images as many "natural" edges are neither a pure edge or a line, but rather have complex intensity profiles. Second order non-linearities in the form of local energy may provide a solution to the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> [1] <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> [15] <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Yet, energy models and their "linear" precursors are intrinsically one-dimensional. They cannot account for another important class of image features: corners, vertices, terminations, junctions etc.. These two-dimensional intensity variations indicate, for example, strong variations in contour orientation, terminations occurring in occlusion situations and many other relevant 2D features.</p><p>In this paper we propose a dual processing scheme which emphasizes the detection of 1D signal variations on the one hand, and of points of strong 2D variations on the other. We present a method which allows <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> to derive a valid indicator for the presence of 1D edges with arbitrary profiles and (2) to detect and localize complex 2D intensity variations. We use the term general edge (GE) for regions of 1D intensity variation and the term keypoint for points of strong 2D intensity variation. The concept of a general edge allows to develop a fully 2D filter model based on linear filters which are polar separable in the Fourier domain. Even and odd filter outputs are then combined to oriented energy.</p><p>Two aspects of our approach are new: (a) The use of a contrast independent measure for deviations from a general edge; this enables us to limit the application of the edge model to points that qualify as general edge points. The local maxima of oriented energy can then be used to localize the edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. (b) The use of differential geometry applied to oriented energy maps, yielding a representation of strong 2D intensity variations (keypoints).</p><p>The work presented here was partially motivated by our interest in biological mechanisms of contour processing <ref type="bibr">[20] [19]</ref> [17] <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">General Edge, Orientation Filters and Local Energy</head><p>We define general edges (GE) to be image features with an arbitrary intensity variation in one direction and constant intensity orthogonal to it. The spectrum of a GE is restricted to a central slice in Fourier space (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). This property of GEs make orientation filters that are polar separable in the Fourier domain a natural choice because they allow to separate filter responses into a term which depends on the profile of the GE and a term that depends only on the difference between filter and edge orientation. Using polar coordinates in the frequency plane, we define the 2-D filters Fn(v, r ---H(u)/2n(r where g(u) defines the radial bandpass characteristics and/2n (satisfying/2,(r --/2n(r + x)) controls the orientation selectivity of the filters (n: orientation index). In this paper, we use/2, (r --cos 2v (r -0n -~) with 0, defining filter orientation.</p><p>With fn being the inverse Fourier transform of Fn the convolution with a GE of orientation 0 has the form s(x, y) 9 fn(x, y) = /2(0 -0,)-g(~, y). Choosing (~, 0) as the rotated coordinate system with ~ in the direction of the GE, g(x, y) becomes a 1D function g(0) which is the convolution of the 1D GE profile with the radial term of the filter H(v). In other words, polar separable filters allow to split up the convolution result with a GE into a term depending on orientation and a term depending on the profile of the GE. This reduces the design of the bandpass characteristics to a 1D problem.</p><p>Since we allow GEs to have arbitrary profiles, simple linear filtering (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> [4]) cannot warrant correct localization. Local energy concepts, however, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> [13] <ref type="bibr">[12] [15]</ref>, seem to overcome this deficit in that they unify the detection of edges, lines and hybrid forms. Local energy requires for each orientation n a pair of even and odd filters whose convolution output is combined by quadrature pair summation to form local energy. A common method is to construct these filter pairs as Hilbert transforms of each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In general, however, Hilbert pairs do not guarantee a monomodal line response in local energy. Gabor pairs, as proposed by Adelson et hi. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, show a monomodal line response but have the drawback that the even Gabor does not integrate to zero. We modified the Gabor scheme by introducing a frequency sweep such that both filters integrate to zero (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). The Fourier transform of these 1D filters provides the radial term H(v) of the polar separable 2D filters. In the present paper, local energy is then defined as the square root of the sum of the squared response of odd and even filters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Local Orientation and Contour Quality</head><p>Using a sufficient number of different orientations, it is possible to determine the exact orientation 0 of a GE: Let Ej be the energy response in orientation j and Emax the maximum over all orientations. Now we define Q(r as N--1 (Ej(r) n(lr</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q(r = E \Ema~(r) -/2(mink=0, ,N-1 [r --0kl)/ (1) j=0</formula><p>"" Since the filters are polar separable in the Fourier domain, it is possible to write Ej = S./2 (0 -0 r) and, since/2 is a monomodal function, E, na~ = S-/2 (mink=0,...,N-t [0 --0k [). Therefore Q(r = 0 r r = 0. Finding the exact orientation 0 of a GE amounts to searching for Qmln = mine=0,, Q(r with r being the angle where Q(r = Qmi,,.</p><p>The value Qmln is a measure of GE conformity. It is zero for a GE and increases with increasing deviation from a perfect GE. If Qmin is greater than a threshold value O, th we consider the image structure to differ significantly from a GE. We take the local orientation as given by r if Qmin &lt; Qth. Otherwise a unique orientation is not defined. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows in the top row four samples of a trihedral vertex with increasing levels of additive gaussian noise. The center row represents the values of Qrnin and emi,.</p><p>The orientation of the lines corresponds to r whereas the match with the general edge model is expressed by line length L = (1 + Qmin) -1. L can be considered an estimate of "GE quality". Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> clearly shows how L decreases in the neighbourhood of a vertex.</p><p>Noise also leads to a degradation of L. The bottom row shows the result of edge detection</p><p>given by the local maxima in energy orthogonal to the orientation emin. Edge processing stops where the GE model is no longer valid.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Keypoints</head><p>In the previous section we have described a method of finding GEs using a measure of quality. On the other hand, there is a class of important image features with pronounced 2D variation of intensity such as line endings, corners, junctions etc. (keypoin~s). In this section we present a method for detecting these keypoints. It is based on the oriented energy maps and does not rely on an explicit model of any particular 2D intensity distribution.</p><p>The basic idea is to exploit the fact that deviations from a GE result in changes of local energy magnitude along the edge. Deviations may be induced by all sort of image features such as (a) a loss of contrast (e.g. line ending), (b) two or more edges of different orientation meeting at one point (e.g. corner, vertex) or (c) continuous changes of orientation (curvature). Directional derivatives in the orientation of a contour seem to be a straight-forward way for detecting keypoints. Local extrema of the first directional derivatives would indicate features like line-endings, corners and junctions. For strong curvature and blobs the second directional derivatives would be more appropriate.</p><p>On general edges, the derivatives along the edge orientation are zero. At keypoints a unique orientation cannot be assigned and thus derivatives in a single orientation are inadequate for representing such features. Using the property that oriented energy separates orientational components, we propose to take for each energy channel the directional derivatives parallelto its orientation. We expect keypoints to have local extrema in derivative magnitudes. However, the directional derivatives are non-zero, also on GEs, for all orientations that differ from the edge orientation. We show that these "false responses" can be selectively eliminated by a compensation scheme that makes use of the systematic nature of these errors. This compensation scheme is based on derivatives orthogonal to each oriented energy channel. We use the terms p-derivative and o-derivative for directional derivatives parallel and ovthogonal to the orientation of a channel, respectively.</p><p>Assuming N filters with orientations given by O,~ = ~ and a GE with orientation 8, we define 8, as unit vector parallel to filter orientation and 8,,j_ as unit vector orthogonal to filter orientation. At location r we define dEn (r)</p><p>[ dUE, (r) 1+ </p><p>as the gradient magnitude parallel to filter orientation (lst p-derivative) and as an estimate of negative curvature of the magnitude of local energy along filter orientation (2nd p-derivative). The latter corresponds to 'bump's' of local energy along filter orientation. Since we are not interested in local minima along oriented energy, p(2)(r) is defined to be zero for positive values of the second directional derivative. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows oriented energy En and its directional p-derivatives for a sample corner. Each column represents one orientation channel. With above definitions and in analogy to local energy we may define a scalar keypoint map K(r):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">/f(r) = max ~p(1)(r)2 + p(2)(r)2 n=0,N--1</formula><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> the raw keypoint map/~ is depicted for a sample corner, a line ending and a T-junction. As mentioned above, the 1st and 2nd p-derivative will be zero on a GE only if (8 -On) = 0. For (8 -On) ~ O, 1st p-derivatives will be zero only at the exact location of a GE and 2nd derivatives will always be &gt; 0 with a local maximum on the GE. Because of these "false responses" to GEs, /~ is insufficient for detecting keypoints selectively.</p><p>The systematic nature of these false responses allows to construct a compensation map</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C(r): +</head><p>Using the properties of a separable filter (orientation selectivity given by cos 2P (8 -Or,)) and the properties of GEs (the local energy of a GE is a GE too), it is easy to show the following relations: pO) (r) = s(r) cos up (8 -On) sin (8 -On) , P(=) (r) = s(r) cos uP (8 -On) sin = (8 -8.)</p><p>where s(r) depends only on the profile of the GE and on the distance from its center.</p><p>Eqn. </p><p>For all O of a GE, the maxima of the 1st and 2nd o-derivatives are greater than the maxima of the 1st and 2nd p-derivatives. Therefore, Z ( O~l,(r)+ PO'(r))= + (P(U'(r)) = , n=0, N-1. k----0 Using the sum over all orientations as compensation has the advantage that it is robust in discrete implementations and we can define the compensation map as N-1</p></div>

Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the different steps of keypoint detection on a simple gray-valued image. The keypoint detection scheme has been tested on a wide variety of complex natural scenes. Results will be shown in the next section. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(D) (E) 5 Experimental results</head><p>Implementation: Convolutions with the twelve filter kernels were carried out in the Fourier domain. Six maps of oriented energy were generated by quadrature pair summation of even and odd filter convolution outputs (we took the squareroot of oriented energy to reduce signal dynamics to those of the original filter outputs). Binary edge maps were generated by finding local maxima orthogonal to the orientation of the best responding energy channel at each location.</p><p>To compute the derivatives in the various directions oriented energy maps were sampled at discrete offset positions around center pixels. First derivatives corresponded to the difference in value at two offset pixels and second derivatives to their average minus the value of the center pixel.</p><p>C o m p l e x scenes: We have tested our contour and keypoint detection scheme with a variety of images of different complexity. One example is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>, an outdoor scene. The scene contains primarily corners and vertices, but also some T-junctions (fence in the lower part of the image). A large proportion are occlusion features generated by the foreground object occluding structures of the building in the background. The curved shape of the sculpture thus introduces some interesting variation in termination angles. The result of the keypoint detection scheme is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>. The dark blobs correspond to the keypoint map superimposed on a contrast reduced version of the original image. Note that the keypoint strength is a function of local image contrast. Thus weaker markings do not necessarily indicate a weaker evidence for the presence of a corner, vertex etc.. It can be seen that no markings, whatsoever, occur on straight contour segments. This proves our compensation scheme to be effective also with more complex 2D intensity configurations. Fig. <ref type="figure">6A</ref> shows, for a part of the image, the contour map extracted with the non-maximum suppression scheme described above. A threshold of 8% of the maximal oriented energy response was applied. One can see that while straight parts of contour are well represented we often find gaps or distortions in the neighbourhood of keypoints. Fig. <ref type="figure">6B</ref> shows the location of keypoints indicated by crosses (threshold again 8% of the global keypoint maximum). As both general edge and keypoint location have been derived from oriented energy, the maps are commensurable and complementary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>We have presented a computational framework for extracting (1) intensity discontinuities which can be described as 1D variations (general edges) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) keypoints with a true 2D intensity distribution (corners, vertices, terminations etc.).</p><p>Using oriented filters with even and odd symmetry we combine their convolution outputs to oriented energy. This quadrature pair summation has the advantage that edges and lines and combinations thereof are treated in a unified way and can be unambiguously localized <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The edge quality measure we derived is used to select for the edge map only those pixels that exceed a predefined quality. This way we can be sure edge detection is valid at these locations.</p><p>The detection scheme for keypoints represents a novel approach to the problem of detecting and localizing image features like corners, junctions or terminations. This is more difficult than detecting edges. The abundant richness of two-dimensional intensity variations seems to prohibit approaches of the form of simplified model prototypes as, for example, the Heaviside function used in edge models. What seems to be important is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by generating invariant representations. Oriented energy is invariant with respect to the polarity and the type of edge <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>We propose to detect keypoints by taking first and second derivatives on the energy maps in the filter direction (p-derivatives). The idea is that true 2D features produce strong variations in the energy signal parallel to its orientation. However, markings also occur for general edges if its orientation and the direction of the derivative differ. We have introduced a scalar compensation map that selectively suppresses these unwanted derivative signals.</p><p>It seems that differential geometry is an adequate way to attack two-dimensional intensity variations. However, compared to other approaches that also use methods of differential geometry (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) , our model is not gray-level based (smoothed version of the original image) but uses oriented energy maps which have the advantage of representing different edge types in a unified way. Furthermore, our approach does not contain any specific model of keypoints, as for example a corner <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, vertex [5], Tor L-junctions. In this respect we cannot expect selectivities for these specific 2-D intensity variations. Our scheme detects and accurately localizes corners (di-, tri-, tetra-hedral junctions of different angles and contrasts) as well as line-terminations, Tjunctions, strong curvature and blobs. However, the information given by the first and second p-derivatives in different orientations may be used to classify the keypoints. We are currently working on a processing scheme to classify keypoints paying attention to occlusion situations and to the distinction between foreground/background structures. Parallels in biological vision: Some of the ideas of the work presented here originated from our interest in the simulation of neural contour mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In fact the different stages of our computational approach can be compared to stages in cortical processing of visual information: even and odd symmetrical, orientation selective filters can be compared to the properties of simple cells. The oriented energy representation is consistent with complex cells which are known to exhibit phase independence <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Hypercomplex or end-stopped cells respond well to short bars, line-ends and corners <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We have related the response behaviour of single-and double-stopped cells to first and second derivative operations based on orientation selective complex cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. These endstoppedoperators can be used to generate "subjective contours". The results have demonstrated the importance of detecting keypoints when dealing with the problem of spatial occlusion.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>p( 1 )</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(r)= ~ and P(=)(r)=_-~--~5 -j ,with [~]+=max(0,~)</figDesc></figure>
