<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> MicroRNA (miRNA)  <p>plays an important role as a regulator in biological processes. Identification of (pre-) miRNAs helps in understanding regulatory processes. Machine learning methods have been designed for pre-miRNA identification. However, most of them cannot provide reliable predictive performances on independent testing data sets. We assumed this is because the training sets, especially the negative training sets, are not sufficiently representative. To generate a representative negative set, we proposed a novel negative sample selection technique, and successfully collected negative samples with improved quality. Two recent classifiers rebuilt with the proposed negative set achieved an improvement of $6 percent in their predictive performance, which confirmed this assumption. Based on the proposed negative set, we constructed a training set, and developed an online system called miRNApre specifically for human pre-miRNA identification. We showed that miRNApre achieved accuracies on updated human and non-human data sets that were 34.3 and 7.6 percent higher than those achieved by current methods. The results suggest that miRNApre is an effective tool for pre-miRNA identification. Additionally, by integrating miRNApre, we developed a miRNA mining tool, mirnaDetect, which can be applied to find potential miRNAs in genome-scale data. MirnaDetect achieved a comparable mining performance on human chromosome 19 data as other existing methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ç 1 INTRODUCTION</head><p>M ICRORNA (miRNA) is a class of single strand, non-cod- ing endogenous RNAs, with $22 nucleotides (nt) in sequence length. MiRNAs play key roles in regulating biological processes, including affecting stability and translation of mRNAs and negatively regulating gene expression in post-transcriptional processes.</p><p>In animals, miRNA biogenesis is described in the following sequential steps. 1) MiRNA genes are first transcribed by RNA polymerase II, resulting in the primary transcripts, which are usually termed as pri-miRNAs.</p><p>2) The pri-miRNAs are processed by the enzyme Drosha into miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) with a distinctive hairpin structure. 3) The pre-miRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 and cleaved by the enzyme Dicer to yield miRNA:miRNA Ã duplexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In plants, miRNA biogenesis is somewhat different from that in animals but a miRNA:miRNA Ã duplex is also generated (the detailed differences can be found in supplement S1, which can be found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ TCBB.2013.146). One strand of the duplex, denoted with an asterisk ( Ã ), is normally degraded. The other strand is the mature miRNA, which performs its regulatory functions by interacting with their target mRNAs (messenger RNAs).</p><p>Because of the importance of miRNAs, the accurate identification of miRNAs is expected to lead researchers to a better understanding of post-transcriptional genetic processes. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the development of computational methods than to traditional experimental methods, which are time-and money-consuming. Computational methods have focused on the use of machine learning techniques to tackle the problem of miRNA identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. These methods treat this problem as a binary classification problem to discriminate real pre-miRNAs from pseudo pre-miRNAs (hairpin-like). Xue et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed Triplet-SVM, which employs a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to train 32 triplet sequence-structure features in human sequences, and successfully identified human pre-miR-NAs with about 90 percent accuracy on both human data and data from other species. Because of the high efficiency of the SVM classifier, other SVM-based prediction methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have been developed based on different types of informative features. Batuwita and Palade <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> constructed a combined feature set by integrating different effective feature subsets. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed 1,300 sequence-structure motifs, which helped their proposed method achieve an improved performance compared with other methods, such as Triplet-SVM. Besides the informative features, the classification algorithms also L. Wei is with the School of Information Science and Technology and with the School of Software, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.

He is with the School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China. E-mail: zyhe@dlut.edu.cn. greatly influence the predictive performance of a computational miRNA identification method. Currently, the widely used classification algorithms include SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, hidden Markov model (HMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, random forest (RF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, linear genetic programming (LGP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and na€ ıve Bayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Although most of existing methods are reported to achieve high predictive performance on their training sets with k-fold cross validation ðk &gt; 1Þ, they may not provide a promising predictive performance on independent testing sets, because we found that the training sets used to build the prediction models are not sufficiently representative, and this was especially true for the negative training sets. Regarding the existing machine learning based methods for miRNA identification, the positive samples were often collected from real pre-miRNAs with experimental validation, while negative samples were collected from sequences similar to real pre-miRNAs, called "pseudo pre-miRNAs" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. It is acknowledged that, when negative samples are sufficiently similar to the positive samples, the negative samples are considered to be of high-quality or representativeness. However, because there is no golden standard to select high-quality negative samples, the construction of a representative negative set is still an open problem.</p><p>At present, the most commonly used negative set was proposed originally by Xue et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, comprising 8,494 pseudo pre-miRNAs. The 8,494 negative samples were collected by a parameter filtering method, which selects those sequences that share the widely accepted characteristics of real pre-miRNAs. The filtering parameters included 1) 18 as the lowest number of base pairings, 2)À15 as the highest free energy, 3) single loop for the predicted secondary structure. In addition to the above parameters, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed other parameters (e.g., sequence length between 51 and 137 nucleotides) and successfully selected 7,879 negative samples. However, we found that all the existing negative sample selection methods have intrinsic limitations: 1) Pre-defined parameter types might not be available because more types of characteristics are being discovered as the number of known miRNAs continues to grow. For instance, the multiple-loop structure is now considered to be an important structure for pre-miRNAs, but previous negative sets considered only single loop structures. 2) To generate negative samples sufficiently similar to the positive ones, the negatives must have high specificity with the positives. Determining the exact filtering parameter values is important for the selection of negatives with such a high specificity. However, current methods use only widely accepted characteristics of real pre-miRNAs to determine parameter values, thereby confining the values to within a certain scope and reducing the specificity of the collected negative samples. 3) Pre-defined parameter assumptions likely miss other information about real pre-miRNAs. Therefore, pre-miRNAs not meeting these assumptions (e.g., !18 base pairings) cannot be identified correctly using machine learning methods based on these assumptions.</p><p>Motivated by the robustness of the prediction methods, we attempted to improve the quality of collected negative samples. Thus, we proposed a multi-level negative sample selection technique, which overcomes the limitations (listed above) of the existing negative sample selection methods. Our proposed technique has two major advantages: 1) it largely reduces dependence on filtering parameters, and 2) it has high adaptability and can be adjusted as new miRNAs are discovered, which guarantees that the collected pseudo pre-miRNAs are sufficiently similar to real pre-miRNAs. Based on this representative negative set, a novel method called miRNApre, was established to discriminate, with good sensitivity and specificity, real human pre-miRNAs from pseudo pre-miRNAs. Importantly, experimental results on independent testing data sets show that the proposed method is a more promising tool than existing methods. The web server on which miR-NApre is implemented is available at <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Moreover, a Java-based mining tool called mirnaDetect, which integrates miRNApre in its algorithm, was designed to scan genome-scale data for potential pre-miRNAs. Compared with the other miRNA finding tools that are available, mir-naDetect achieves, at least, a comparable performance. The source code of mirnaDetect can be downloaded at <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Proposed Feature Set</head><p>Both the primary sequences and secondary structures of miRNAs are reported to be conserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Therefore, based on this property, we carefully constructed a feature set, considering the following three aspects: 1) primary sequence based, 2) secondary structure based, and 3) sequence-structure based. Each of these aspects is described as follows:</p><p>Primary sequence based features. Here, we employed 64 base composition variables. For a given RNA sequence S, triple-nucleotide frequencies %X XY Z are computed, where X XY Z represents the contiguous three nucleotides in S, and X X; Y ; Z 2 P ¼ fA; U; C; Gg. As a result, we obtained 64 possible combinations and computed the occurrence frequency of each combination in S. Finally, the occurrence frequencies of all 64 combinations were considered as 64 primary-sequence based features.</p><p>Secondary structure based features. The minimum free energy (MFE) describes the stability of a secondary structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The secondary structure of a real pre-miRNA is likely to have a lower MFE value than that of a pseudo pre-miRNA. Based on this observation, we computed the MFE value of a secondary structure using a secondary structure prediction tool called RNAfold <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. On the other hand, there are also significant differences in the base-pair content of a secondary structure between real and pseudo pre-miRNAs. This difference was also taken into account as one of the features.</p><p>Sequence-structure based features. Recent research indicated that the distributions of local contiguous sub-structure and sequence features of real pre-miRNAs are distinct from those of pseudo pre-miRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Therefore, features containing both local sequence and structure information were also considered. We used the 32 sequence-structure-based features from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> that have proven to be sufficiently informative for miRNA identification. Details of the 32 features can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Thus, a total of 98 features were used to build our feature set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Classifier Selection and Optimization</head><p>The SVM algorithm is well-known for its high generalization ability for solving linear and non-linear classification problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Therefore, we used the SVM algorithm as the classification algorithm in the present research.</p><p>The major rules of SVM for (pre-)miRNA classification can be described as the follows: 1) for a given training data set, x i ði ¼ 1; 2 . . . ; NÞ is a feature vector of the corresponding sequence labeled with y i ðþ1 if it is a real pre-miRNA or À1 if it is a pseudo pre-miRNA), where N is the number of sequences in the training set. 2) SVM is likely to generate a decision boundary (function) to discriminate real pre-miRNAs from pseudo pre-miRNAs in the training set. The decision function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f x ð Þ ¼ sgn X n i¼1 a i y i Kðx i ; xÞ þ b ! ;<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where a i ð0 a i CÞ is the to-be-learned coefficient and K is the kernel function that can turn non-linear classification problems into linear classification problems. Here, the radial basis function (RBF), a popular and highly reliable function, was chosen as the kernel function of the SVM algorithm. The formula of RBF kernel is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">K x i ; x ð Þ¼exp Àgjjx i À xjj ð Þ ;<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where g is the parameter that represents the similarity level of the feature space so that SVM achieves its optimal state. The penalty parameter C is another important parameter that is commonly used to optimize SVM. We used the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> interface of the LibSVM package (version 2.86) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> as the SVM program. To achieve the optimal performance of LibSVM, we conducted a grid search <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for LibSVM based on our training set, and obtained C ¼ 32;768 and g ¼ 4:9 Â 10 À4 as the optimal parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Negative Sample Selection</head><p>Nearly all existing negative samples were generated by a parameter filtering approach that retains pseudo pre-miR-NAs with the widely accepted characteristics of real pre-miRNAs. Using a similar parameter filtering approach (see supplement S2, available online, for detail), we constructed an initial negative set S negativeð0Þ , which included 26,230 negative samples (hairpin-like sequences). However, like the existing negative samples, our initial negative samples (extracted by such heuristic criteria) were not similar enough to the corresponding real pre-miRNAs. Therefore, we developed a multi-level negative sample selection technique to mine high-quality negative samples (pseudo pre-miRNAs) from the coding region sequences (CDSs) as stated in the following steps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>):</p><p>Step 1. Search for homologous sub-sequences of the CDSs from known mature miRNAs using BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, with the default settings for the BLAST parameters. Collect the homologous sub-sequences into a "homology set" called S-homology.</p><p>Step 2. Flank all the elements in S-homology by 100 nt upstream and downstream, and compute the secondary structures of the corresponding flanked elements with RNAfold <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The secondary structures of real pre-miR-NAs are typical hairpin structures, and the stems of the hairpins contain the mature miRNAs. Therefore, we extracted the sub-sequences of the corresponding flanked elements that satisfied this property. The extracted subsequences were collected into a "pre-miRNA-like candidate" set called S-candidate.</p><p>Step 3. Use a two-level filtering method to filter Scandidate. In the first level, two widely accepted criteria of real pre-miRNAs (MFEI &gt; 0:8, and 0:7 &gt; GC% &gt; 0:3Þ are used to filter all the elements in S-candidate. The minimal folding free energy index (MFEI) criterion is used to discriminate pre-miRNAs from other RNA sequences with high specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In the second level, the S-candidate elements that remain after the first level filtering are fed into a LibSVM classifier model called P ði iÀ1Þ ; i i ! 1. The elements predicted as "positive" were considered as potential real pre-miRNAs, and collected in a new set called S negativeð ðiÞ .</p><p>Step 4. Use S negativeð ðiÞ to replace the negative training set S negativeði iÀ1Þ of the prediction model P ði iÀ1Þ , and rebuild the original prediction model P ði iÀ1Þ to generate a new prediction model P ð ðiÞ . Then, repeat Step1 to Step 4 several times until i &gt; 10:</p><p>In this way, we obtain a set of negative sets,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S S negative ¼ S negative 0 ð Þ ; S negative 1 ð Þ ; . . . ; S negative 10 ð Þ È É ;</formula><p>and a set of prediction models, P ¼ fP ð0Þ ; P ð1Þ ; . . . ; P ð10Þ g:</p><p>Every prediction model in P was evaluated with a 10-fold cross validation on the corresponding training set. The negative set S negativeðj jÞ ð0 j 10Þ relative to the prediction model P ðj jÞ with the highest performance was considered as the highest quality negative set compared with other negative sets in S S negative , and was chosen as our negative set. After eliminating sequences that shared sequence identity &gt; 50% with real pre-miRNAs in the CDSs from the selected negative set S negativeðj jÞ , 14,661 hairpin-like sequences (negative samples) remained in the final negative set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">A miRNA Mining Tool-mirnaDetect</head><p>Based on the multi-level negative sample selection technique algorithm described above, we developed a javabased miRNA mining program called mirnaDetect, to detect (pre-) miRNAs from human genome-scale data. The mirnaDetect pipeline is similar to the negative sample selection technique, as described in the following steps:</p><p>Step 1. Search for homologous sub-sequences of the query genome sequence S from known mature miRNAs using BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, with the default settings for the BLAST parameters. Collect the homologous sub-sequences into a "homology set" called S-homology.</p><p>Step 2. Flank all the elements in S-homology by 100 nt upstream and downstream, and compute the secondary structures of the corresponding flanked elements with RNAfold <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The hairpins that contain the homologous sub-sequences in the stem are extracted and collected into a "pre-miRNA-like candidate" set called S-candidate.</p><p>Step 3. Use a two-level filtering method to filter Scandidate. In the first level, the two widely accepted criteria of real pre-miRNAs (MFEI &gt; 0:8, and 0:7 &gt; GC% &gt; 0:3) are used to filter all the elements S-candidate. In the second level, the S-candidate elements that remain after the first level filtering are fed into our proposed miRNA prediction method, miRNApre. The elements predicted as "positive" were considered as potential real pre-miRNAs, and collected in the "output" set of the mining results called S-output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Data Sets</head><p>In a machine learning method for pre-miRNA identification, a positive set consists of experimentally verified pre-miRNAs, whereas a negative set consists of pre-miRNAlike hairpins, called pseudo pre-miRNAs.</p><p>Positive set. We downloaded all 18,226 pre-miRNA entries that were available in miRBase version 18 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> as our initial positive samples. These pre-miRNA sequences are from 168 species. A total of 1,527 sequences are human pre-miRNAs, and 16,699 are pre-miRNAs from other species. Because sequence redundancies may bias the performance of a classifier, we removed redundant sequences from the positive set, leaving 16,520 non-redundant pre-miRNAs, including 1,496 human and 13,588 non-human pre-miRNAs in the final positive set.</p><p>Negative set. A total of 14,661 pseudo pre-miRNAs, including 1,446 pseudo human pre-miRNAs, were generated using our multi-level negative sample selection technique (see Section 2.3). All of these pseudo pre-miRNAs were included in the negative set.</p><p>Training set. To construct the training set, the following two aspects were considered:</p><p>1. Sequences from the same miRNA family were excluded from the positive training set because miR-NA families include homologous (highly similar) pre-miRNAs from different species <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The positive training set contains 503 human pre-miRNAs, which we obtained by selecting one or two human pre-miRNAs from each of 474 miRNA families, and 652 human pre-miRNAs that did not belong to any family, yielding a total of 1,155 human real pre-miR-NAs in the positive training set. 2. To avoid imbalances among the training data that may result in poor classification performance, the Testing sets. To construct the testing sets, the following two aspects were considered: 1. To evaluate the ability of the classifier to identify non-human pre-miRNAs, we constructed a testing set that included non-human pre-miRNAs. Because pre-miRNAs that belong to the same miRNA family are likely to be highly similar, to construct our testing set we included only pre-miRNAs from miRNA families that do not appear in the positive training set and pre-miRNAs that do not belong to any miRNA family. As a result, a total of 9,176 pre-miR-NAs from non-human species, were collected in a "non-human species" set called NON-HSA. To further reduce any similarity between NON-HSA and the positive training set, we removed all pre-miR-NAs that shared &gt; 50% sequence identity with pre-miRNAs in the positive training set. This process yielded a final NON-HSA testing set, which includes 9,159 pre-miRNAs (5,289 from non-human animal, 3,807 from plant, and 63 from virus).</p><p>2. While writing this paper, about 76 new human pre-miRNAs were discovered and added to miRBase. After removing the redundant sequences, 71 pre-miRNAs were collected in a set called LATEST-HSA. To remove any similarity between the positive training set and this testing set, we conducted a BLAST search, and successfully eliminated two pre-miRNAs that shared &gt; 50% sequence identity with pre-miRNAs in the positive training set. As a result, 69 of the newly found human pre-miRNAs were collected to form the LATEST-HSA testing set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Measurement</head><p>Three metrics, SE (sensitivity), SP (specificity), and Acc (accuracy), are commonly employed to evaluate the performance of a classifier. In most studies, Acc has been the major metric that is used. However, when dealing with imbalance data, geometric mean (Gm) is another metric that is commonly used in class imbalance learning research <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> because it can give a more accurate evaluation for the classifier performance on imbalance data. Therefore, for the imbalance data in our research, we pay more attention to Gm rather than Acc. The metrics are based on various parameters including true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false negative (FN), and false positive (FP), which are the raw output of the classification results. Using these parameters, we obtained the following four metrics as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">SE ¼ T P T P þ F N Â 100 ½% (3) SP ¼ T N T N þ F P Â 100 ½% (4) Gm ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi SE Â SP p Â 100 ½%<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">Acc ¼ T N þ T P T N þ F P þ F N þ T P Â 100 ½% (6)</formula><p>3 RESULTS/DISCUSSION For a classifier model, it is likely that the model will generate a decision boundary that classifies the positive from negative training samples as correctly as possible, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>. When using a negative testing set, which is similar to the positive training set, to evaluate the reliability of the decision boundary, we observed that the majority of samples in the negative testing set were incorrectly classified (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). However, if using a new negative training set that is more similar to the positive training set to train a model, the trained model tends to generate a new decision boundary (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). When the new boundary was tested with the same negative testing set used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, we observed (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>) that nearly all the negative samples were classified correctly. These findings reveal the importance of negative samples for machine learning algorithms, and indicate that the higher the similarity between the positive and negative training sets, the higher will be the performance of the classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Representativeness of Our Negative Set</head><p>For comparison, we investigated the representativeness of our negative set under the proposed classifier (miRNApre), and under two recent prominent classifiers, Triplet-SVMclassifier and Mirident-classifier.</p><p>Modeling the Triplet-SVM-classifier with our negative set. We used our proposed negative set to replace the original negative set (denoted as Xue's negative set) to remodel the Triplet-SVM-classifier. A testing set (denoted as TE-C), which is previously used to test the original classifier model, was also employed to evaluate the new model. There are 30 human pre-miRNAs and 1,000 pseudo hairpins in TE-C. The evaluation results achieved by the original and new model on TE-C are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and the detailed results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> of supplement S3, available online. It can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> that when tested on the set TE-C, the new model generated an improved performance in both the identification of real pre-miRNAs and pseudo pre-miRNAs as compared with the original model. On average, SE increased by 3.4 percent and SP increased by 2.4 percent (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> of supplement S3, available online, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), both of which are significant increases. This result indicates the representativeness of our proposed negative set.</p><p>Modeling the MiRNApre classifier with Xue's negative set. To further demonstrate the representativeness of our negative set, we compared the performance of miRNApre remodeled with Xue's negative set with the original model based on our negative set. The performance of miRNApre was evaluated with a 10-fold cross validation on our training set. The results are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> (detailed results can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> of supplement S3, available online). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, compared with the performance of miRNApre with our negative set, its performance with Xue's negative set significantly decreased in terms of SE, SP, Gm, and Acc. This result further suggests that Xue' s negative set is less effective for generating a representative prediction model than our negative set.  Modeling the Mirident classifier with our negative set. We also remodeled state-of-the-art classifier (Mirident) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> using our negative set, and generates a new training model. An independent testing set, which was used previously in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, was also employed to evaluate the performance of the new model. The testing set consists of several sub-sets of non-human pre-miRNAs (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> for detail). The evaluation results on this set are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. It can be seen that, on the three types of non-human animal pre-miRNAs, the new model shows an improved performance in predicting real pre-miRNAs (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>), but achieves a slightly diminished accuracy on three of the viral species (EBV, HCMV and MGHV68) in the testing set. The diminished accuracy may be because there were only 25, 11, and 15 pre-miRNAs from EBV, HCMV and MGHV, respectively, in the evaluation. Therefore, it is expected that as more viral pre-miRNAs are discovered, the new model will perform better than the original one for the identification of virus pre-miR-NAs. In general, the new model generated an improved prediction accuracy of 93.6 percent on this independent testing set, which is 7.6 percent higher than the original model. This also confirmed that our negative set is more representative than existing negative sets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Performance of the LibSVM Classifier</head><p>Here, we used a 10-fold cross validation to evaluate our classifier (LibSVM) and other well-known classifiers (Logistic, Random Forest, and Na€ ıve Bayes). All four classifiers based on the proposed feature set were evaluated with a 10-fold cross validation on our training set. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, LibSVM outperformed the other three in terms of SP, Gm and Acc. In particular, LibSVM achieved the highest Gm of 98.0 percent, demonstrating that our classifier more effectively classified the real/ pseudo pre-miRNAs compared with the other classifiers tested. This experimental result also confirmed the high efficiency of the SVM algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Performance of LibSVM on the Proposed Feature Set</head><p>Ten-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of LibSVM based on the same training set but different feature sets. The results over the proposed feature set and its sub-feature sets are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. Three individual feature sets (subsets) and a combined feature set were used. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, LibSVM achieved a significantly higher performance with subset C compared with the other two subsets (A and B), which implies that the features in C may contain important attributes for the identification of human pre-miRNAs. When all three feature subsets were combined into one feature set, the predictive performance of LibSVM was higher than with any of the individual subsets. This suggests that different types of features made positive contributions to the improved predictive performance. Although the improvement achieved by the combined feature set (Gm increased by 0.4 percent and Acc increased by 0.5 percent) was not significant compared to the bestperforming feature subset C, we anticipate that the combined feature set may significantly outperform subset C when more complex data set is presented, because the combined feature set contains more types of informative features than subset C.</p><p>We also investigate the importance of each of the features in the proposed combined feature set, which we expect will help researchers select the features that are "important" in their specific situations. The top 10 "important" features are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref> (detailed results are presented in supplement S4, available online). As shown, the top nine features are primary-sequencerelated features, indicating their major influence on the identification of real/pseudo human pre-miRNAs.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Analyzing the Performance of miRNApre</head><p>Although the above experiments have shown that the combined feature set and the LibSVM classifier of miR-NApre are relatively effective, our concern was to evaluate the overall performance of miRNApre when it is used to identify pre-miRNAs in real applications. First, we used a 10-fold cross validation test to evaluate the performance of miRNApre on the training set which contains 1,155 real pre-miRNAs and 1,155 pseudo pre-miR-NAs. We found that miRNApre achieved a satisfactory performance in terms of SP (98.2 percent), SE (97.9 percent), Acc (98.1 percent), and Gm (98 percent). In particular, the high specificity of miRNApre effectively reduces the false positives generated in a prediction. Therefore, in real applications, the high SP is meaningful because there are far more pseudo pre-miRNAs than real pre-miRNAs in genome data.</p><p>Next, we further used two independent testing sets, LATEST-HSA and NON-HSA, to test the capability of miRNApre in identifying newly found human and nonhuman data, respectively. For comparison purposes, in addition to miRNApre, we used two state-of-the-art classification methods (CSHMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and Mirident <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). For a fair comparison, both these methods were evaluated under the parameter settings used in the original publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The results of the comparisons on the two testing sets are discussed below.</p><p>Testing set LATEST-HSA. The prediction accuracies of CSHMM, Mirident, and miRNApre on the updated independent testing set LATEST-HSA, which consists of 69 newly found human pre-miRNAs, are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. It can be seen that miRNApre, which achieved a prediction accuracy of 97.1 percent (identified 67 of 69 pre-miRNAs), significantly outperformed Mirident and CSHMM. Importantly, we observed that miRNApre maintained a high accuracy on this updated independent testing set, while the other methods achieved a significantly diminished accuracy compared to their reported accuracies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This result demonstrates that miRNApre is a more promising classifier than the existing ones.</p><p>Testing set NON-HSA. To evaluate the capability of our method in identifying non-human pre-miRNAs, we performed CSHMM, Mirident, and miRNApre on the testing set NON-HSA, which contains 5,289 non-human animal pre-miRNAs, 3,807 plant pre-miRNAs, and 63 virus pre-miRNAs. The prediction accuracies are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. It can be seen that miRNApre achieved excellent prediction accuracies for identifying pre-miRNAs from nonhuman animal (91.7 percent), plant (94.2 percent), and virus (93.7 percent). Our method significantly outperformed the other two methods by 10.6 percent on animal pre-miRNAs and by 4.3 percent on plant pre-miRNAs. However, Mirident was the best-performing method on virus pre-miRNAs. Mirident correctly identified 61 of 63 virus pre-miRNAs, while miRNApre correctly identified 59 of the 63 virus pre-miRNAs (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>), indicating that our method is actually comparable to Mirident. Importantly, miRNApre achieved an overall accuracy of 92.7 percent in the NON-HSA set, substantially outperforming the other methods in identifying non-human pre-miRNAs (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Performance of mirnaDetect</head><p>To test the performance our novel miRNA mining program mirnaDetect, we used it to scan human chromosome 19 (Chr 19), which is known to harbors 108 verified pre-miRNAs (miRBase version 18), for pre-miRNAs. Mir-naDetect identified 2,645 sequences on Chr 19 as positive predictions. Of these, 71 were from among the 108 known pre-miRNAs; therefore, we considered the 71 as true positives.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of mirnaDetect, we used two other miRNA finding methods, CSHMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and MIR-eNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, for comparison. CSHMM is a machine learning based method that is used either to analyze individual  As shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>, 70 and 74 true positives were correctly predicted by CSHMM, and MIReNA, respectively. Thus, mirnaDetect, which identified 71 true positives, is comparable with the other two methods, demonstrating a good sensitivity of mirnaDetect. On the other hand, it is more important for a method to maintain high specificity when detecting candidate pre-miRNAs from genomescale data. In other words, the method should generate as few false positives as possible. From this viewpoint, MIR-eNA and CSHMM generated 10,626, and 18,258 pre-miRNA candidates, respectively, while mirnaDetect found only 2,645 candidates (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). Thus, the low specificities of MIReNA and CSHMM make them poor choices for mining pre-miRNAs from genome-scale data. MirnaDetect achieved a relatively high specificity, indicating that it is at least comparable to existing mining methods for detecting known pre-miRNAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this study, we explored the importance of representative negative samples for machine learning based methods for pre-miRNA identification. We found that existing negative sets suffer from low quality, and based on them it is difficult to generate an effective and promising prediction model. To improve the quality of negative samples, we proposed a multi-level negative sample selection method and successfully constructed a high-quality negative set. Two recent classifiers (Triplet-SVM and Mirident) were remodeled with our negative samples, after which both achieved significantly improved performances, suggesting the superiority of our negative set.</p><p>Based on this representative negative set, we have developed an online classifier system (miRNApre) to discriminate human pre-miRNAs from pseudo human pre-miRNAs. Our method outperformed two state-of-the-art methods on both updated human test data and nonhuman test data. The high accuracy of our miRNApre method on different data sets suggests that our method is a promising tool for miRNA identification. Furthermore, based on the algorithm of our proposed negative selection technique, we developed a java-based tool (mirnaDetect) by integrating miRNApre into its mining paradigm. We then showed that mirnaDetect predicted a comparable number of known pre-miRNAs from Chr 19 as existing miRNA mining methods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
