<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) refer to the systems combining computational elements with physical entities. With seamless integration of sensing, control, communication and computation, applications of CPS can be found in a wide range of sectors such as smart grid, intelligent transportation and environment monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, where wireless sensors play important roles due to the essential demand for remote estimation of system states. When compared with traditional wired sensors, advantages such as low cost, easy installation and maintain enable wireless sensors conveniently and simultaneously measuring the system processes and then transmitting information wirelessly to remote control centers. However, the vulnerability of wireless communication channel brings new risks of cyber security threats to CPS. In addition, the increasing penetration to safety-critical infrastructures of the society amplifies the severities under such attacks. Therefore, the security issue is of fundamental importance to ensure the safe operation of CPS and has attracted considerable interest from both academic and industrial communities in the past few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>There are two major categories of cyber attacks on CPS that are commonly investigated in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>: deception (integrity) attacks (corresponding to the traditional security goal: integrity), and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks (corresponding to another goal: availability). The former ones focus on modifying the information in the transmitted data packets, while the latter ones block the exchange of information among parts of CPS. As such, though the loss of information would degrade the estimation performance, when the attacker could access the data and modify it intentionally, the misleading information might cause further negative impacts on the operation of systems, and making the integrity attacks more difficult to detect. Therefore, the complexity and importance to investigate the integrity attacks motivate intensive research efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Intuitively, if the data is modified under integrity attacks, the statistical properties in general change accordingly. Motivated by such observation, the residue-based χ 2 detectors are widely deployed to distinguish attacks by checking the characteristics of the received data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, simply relying on the individual information and properties of each measurement data may leave loophole for the adversaries. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the authors considered integrity attacks against parameters estimation in smart grids. By exploiting the configuration parameters of a power system and properly choosing the false data, the proposed attacking patterns for different attacker capability scenarios can bypass the failure detector and inject arbitrary deviations in the state estimate from its true value. Similar results can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> the authors considered linear deception attacks on a linear estimation process; they derived the optimal strategy for the attacker in the sense that the state estimation error achieves maximum value while the modified data still keeps the same statistical distribution as the original. When multiple sensors were deployed, a gametheoretic approach was provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, where the remote estimator was designed to distinguish and utilize the sensor measurements that may be potentially corrupted by a malicious attacker to estimate a binary random variable. The estimator aimed to minimize the probability of the estimation error while the attacker had an opposite objective; a computational efficient sub-optimal estimator was also provided.</p><p>In this work, we study the problem of detection against integrity attacks on multiple sensors for remote state estimation of a dynamic process. We extend the parameter estimation of a static model considered in the work such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, to a dynamic process, which can be regarded as a more general description of CPS applications. Motivated by the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for the single sensor case, we propose a multisensor framework. If the remote estimator would still adopt a standard χ 2 detector in the multi-sensor case and verifies the data based on their statistical characteristics before processing them, we show that it will fail to distinguish the modified data as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. To improve the detection and estimation performance, we investigate how to extract the information from trusted sensors and based on such information and the correlation between sensor measurements to examine the unreliable measurements. Instead of the one-sided analysis of the attacker's optimal solution for the single sensor case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we propose three sequential data verification and fusion procedures for different detection information scenarios based on the analysis of possible attacker's behavior.</p><p>The main contributions of the present work are summarized as follows:</p><p>1) We study the optimal deception attacks in a multi-sensor remote estimation framework, which is a more general model and description for real applications. 2) We propose three sequential data verification and fusion procedures for different detection scenarios based on the information extracted from the trusted sensors and the correlation between the sensors. We also derive the optimal parameters for the last two detectors (Theorem 4.4).</p><p>3) The corresponding impacts of possible attacking patterns on the estimation performance under different detectors are analyzed explicitly (Lemma 3.2 and Theorem 4.2).</p><p>The optimal linear deception attacking strategy is also derived (Lemma 4.3). The remainder of the work is organized as follows. Section II presents the system framework and preliminaries about the linear deception attacks in the single sensor case. Section III considers this security problem in a multi-sensor framework. Section IV proposes three sequential data verification and fusion procedures for different detection scenarios. Numerical examples and simulations are demonstrated in Section V. Section VI provides some concluding remarks.</p><p>Notations: Z denotes the set of all integers and N the positive integers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Remote Estimation for the Single-sensor Scenario</head><p>At each time step, each sensor will send its own measurement data to a remote estimator through a wireless communication network.</p><p>For the single sensor case, to estimate the state based on the sensor measurements, standard Kalman filter is adopted as in the following form <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">xk|k-1 = Ax k-1 , P k|k-1 = AP k-1 A ′ + Q, K k = P k|k-1 C ′ [CP k|k-1 C ′ + R] -1 , xk = Ax k-1 + K k [y(k) -C xk|k-1 ], P k = (I -K k C)P k|k-1 , where xk E[x(k)|y(1 : k)] and P k E [( x(k) - xk )( x(k) -xk ) ′ |y(1 : k) ]</formula><p>, are the Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) state estimate and the corresponding error covariance. The recursion starts from x0 = 0 and P 0 = Π 0 0.</p><p>To simplify the subsequent discussion, we define the Lyapunov and Riccati operators h, g :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S n + → S n + as: h(X) AXA ′ + Q, g(X) X -XC ′ [CXC ′ + R] -1 CX.</formula><p>The estimation error covariance of the Kalman filter converges to a unique steady-state value from any initial condition exponentially fast <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, i.e., lim k→+∞ P k|k-1 = P , where P is the unique positive semi-definite solution of h • g(X) = X.</p><p>Due to the development of manufacturing technology, most modern sensors are equipped with on-board chips and have computation capacities and are thus called "smart sensors". Therefore, for the single sensor case, the sensor can first locally process the raw measurement data to obtain a local a priori estimate xk|k-1 and send the innovation of the measurements compared with xk|k-1 instead (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>), where the innovation is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">z k y(k) -C xk|k-1 .</formula><p>The innovation z k has the following properties: Lemma 2.1 <ref type="bibr">([12]</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">1) z k is zero-mean Gaussian; 2) z k and z j are independent, ∀j ̸ = k; 3) Σ z E[z k z ′ k ] = CP C ′ + R.</formula><p>Sending the innovation (zero-mean Gaussian) instead of the raw measurement is communication-efficient, which can reduce the communication bandwidth and the energy consumption of the sensors due to a lower average signal magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In addition, the innovation will approach a steady-state distribution. From the perspective of security, the zero-mean white Gaussian distributed innovation of the sensor's measurement will enable the remote estimator to detect the abnormal data that may be modified by potential cyber-attackers more easily than the raw data. On the other hand, as stated in the papers dealing with quantized control and estimation, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, if the quantization is carried out for sensor's raw measurement, a larger quantization noise will be generated if the values of the raw measurements are large. As a result, sending raw measurements leads to information loss and lower estimation accuracy. Therefore, sending innovation 1 instead of raw measurements is widely adopted in the literature, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Optimal Linear Deception Attacks</head><p>In many applications, the residue-based χ 2 detectors are deployed at the remote estimator's side by checking the statical characteristics of the innovation data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>). A typical χ 2 detector for the innovation z k adopts the following hypothesis testing:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ξ k = k ∑ i=k-J+1 z ′ i Σ -1 z z i H0 ≶ H1 η,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the null hypotheses H 0 represents that the received data is normal while H 1 is on the contrary, J is the window size of detection and the threshold η is to be designed properly. As z k is i.i.d. Gaussian, ξ k is χ 2 distributed with Jn y degree of freedom. If the statistic ξ k exceeds a certain threshold η, an alarm will be triggered and the current measurement will be dropped. However, though this type of detector works well against many types of integrity attacks, the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> showed that by designing the strategies properly, the attacker can inject 1 When the sensors send raw measurements to the estimator, the estimation process will keep the same. As shown later, for the attacker, the optimal linear attacking strategy becomes to change the raw data y k to y a k = -y k + 2Ca xk|k-1 . In such a case, during the estimation procedure, the innovation calculated by the estimator based on the modified data</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">y a k becomes z a k = y a k -Ca xk|k-1 = -y k + Ca xk|k-1 = -z k ,</formula><p>which is equivalent to change the sign of the innovation, i.e., z a k = -z k . Therefore, sending the raw measurements will not change our results.</p><p>deception data without being detected by the χ 2 detector. To be more specific, we assume that the sensor consists of two parts: the computation module (physical part) and the transmission module or gateway (cyber part). The sensor calculates the local estimate and innovation at its computation module, and then sends the innovation to the transmission module for transmitting to the remote estimator. The attacker can compromise the cyber part of the sensor, i.e., the transmission module, to change the data packet; however, the attacker cannot access the local estimation process inside the sensor's computation module. We assume that the attacker modifies the innovation data through a linear attacking form (in the subsequent discussion, the superscript ∼ is used to denote the quantities under attacks) zk</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">T k z k + b k , where b k follows i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian distribution with covariance Σ b and independent of z k . Clearly, zk still follows i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian distribution with covariance Σ z = T k Σ z T ′ k + Σ b . Then the attacker can choose any proper matrix T k such that Σ z -T k Σ z T ′ k 0, and then determine b k with covariance Σ b = Σ z -T k Σ z T ′ k 0.</formula><p>In such case, it is easy to verify that Σ z = Σ z , i.e., the modified innovation zk shares the same statistical characteristics as the original innovation z k . As a consequence, the deception data can be injected into the estimation procedure while the χ 2 detector fails to distinguish these two types of data in the single sensor case. From Theorem 1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the impacts of the deception data on the state estimation error covariance at the remote estimator's side can be quantified based on the following recursion</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Pk = A Pk-1 A ′ + Q + P C ′ (Σ -1 z -T ′ k Σ -1 z -Σ -1 z T k )CP .</formula><p>The optimal attack strategy in the single sensor case is summarized in the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 2.2 (Theorem 2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>): The optimal linear attack is achieved when T k = -I and b k = 0 which will result in the largest estimation error covariance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. LINEAR DECEPTION ATTACKS IN THE MULTI-SENSOR SCENARIO</head><p>Though the linear deception attacks cannot be detected in the single sensor case, the story when the remote estimator receives data from multiple sensors will be different.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Remote Estimation for the Multi-sensor Scenario</head><p>For the multi-sensor scenario, we need to fuse all the measurements from different sensors at the same time step. Denote Y k {y 1 (k), y 2 (k), ..., y N (k)} = {y 1:N (k)} as the measurements set for the remote estimator at time step k. Define:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">xk E[x(k)|Y 1:k ],<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P k E [( x(k) -xk )( x(k) -xk ) ′ |Y 1:k ] ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>as the state estimate and the corresponding error covariance. Similar to the single sensor case, to reduce the communication bandwidth and for the security purpose (the innovation will approach a steady-state distribution that can be easily checked by a false data detector), each sensor will also first locally process the raw measurement data and send the innovation of the measurement to the remote estimator. However, in the multi-sensor scenario, each single sensor cannot compute the a-priori estimate xk|k-1 at the remote estimator's side based on its own measurements. Therefore, one efficient way is that the remote estimator broadcasts its xk|k-1 at each time step to reduce the communication costs of the sensors (the remote estimator can access the information from other sensors and more energy resources than a single sensor). Under such a protocol, the innovation sent by each sensor is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">z k,i y i (k) -C i xk|k-1 . (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>Similar to the single sensor case, we can easily verify that the innovation z k,i is also i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian with covariance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Σ zi = C i P k|k-1 C ′ i + R i . (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>There are many ways to obtain the MMSE state estimate based on multiple measurements without attackers, e.g., parallel, sequential <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, as shown later, when the data is unreliable, the performance of most existing methods may be affected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Linear Deception Attacks on Multiple Sensors</head><p>Suppose that we have a group of sensors in secure places and their measurements are guaranteed to be reliable (similar settings can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). For convenience, denote the set of "safe" sensors as S with its cardinality represented by |S| = M and the set of the rest unreliable sensors as A = N \S with |A| = N -M . Without loss of generality, we assume that the sensors i = 1, 2, ..., M are "safe" and the rest sensors are unreliable.</p><p>To simplify the following discussion, we can combine the data from "safe" sensors into one general sensor with measure-</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">ment matrix C s [C 1 , C 2 , ..., C M ] ′ with noises covariance matrix R s diag(R 1 , R 2 , ..., R M ).</formula><p>Instead of requiring each pair (A, C i ) to be detectable, we can assume that the pair (A, C s ) is observable. Similarly, the general unreliable sensor can be denoted with subscript a.</p><p>Remark 3.1: For the case when the measurement noises in different sensors are correlated, the noises covariance matrix R s and R a are no longer block diagonal. However, the main results in this paper still hold.</p><p>After the generalization, at each time step k, the remote estimator will receive two innovation packets, namely, z k,s and zk,a , where the innovation data from the unreliable sensor may be modified by the linear deception attacks:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">zk,a T k z k,a + b k . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>Similar to the single sensor case, the attacker can choose any proper T k and b k to maintain the same statistical characteristics<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> as the original innovation z k,a :</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">Σ za = Σ za . (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>If the remote estimator would still adopt a standard χ 2 detector as in the single sensor case and verify the data based on their statistical characteristics before processing them, we can infer that it will fail to distinguish the modified data as before. To improve the performance, one possible way is to extract the information from the trusted sensors and based on such information to examine the unreliable measurements, which summarizes the main idea of the following part.</p></div>

Sequential Data Fusion and Verification</head><p>To detect the suspicious data, we propose a data verification and fusion algorithm following a sequential procedure.</p><p>In the sequential fusion procedure, the quantities xk , P k and the corresponding Kalman gain are updated sequentially to produce the MMSE estimate of the state when the measurements are reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.

Note that the specific detectors to determine whether or not to fuse the suspicious data in Algorithm 1 will be discussed in details in Section IV.

When the attacker selects the optimal linear deception attacks parameters as in the single sensor case (T k = -1), the impact of the attack on the estimation performance will be significantly increased. However, the gap between Σ H1 and Σ H0 will reach the maximum, which will help the failure detector to better distinguish the deception data from the original data. In the meanwhile, one can also note that the distribution of the modified data, namely, Σ H1 , depends on the attacking pattern T k chosen by the attacker and the detector may not access such information. Therefore, the optimal forms of the detector may vary based on the information or knowledge holding by the attacker and the estimator, which we will discuss in details in the following section.</p></div>

Therefore, the Bayes risk of the proposed detector in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> under hypothesis H 0 can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">R(H 0 ) = P[ξ 2 k,a τ |H 0 ]Tr{P a } + P[ξ 2 k,a &gt; τ |H 0 ]Tr{P b },<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">P F P[ξ 2 k,a &gt; τ |H 0 ],<label>(28)</label></formula><p>is the probability of false alarm and similarly,</p><formula xml:id="formula_76">R(H 1 ) = P[ξ 2 k,a τ |H 1 ]Tr{P c } + P[ξ 2 k,a &gt; τ |H 1 ]Tr{P d }, (<label>29</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_77">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">P D P[ξ 2 k,a &gt; τ |H 1 ],<label>(30)</label></formula><p>is the probability of detection. Consequently, the overall Bayes risk is</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">R = R(H 0 )P(H 0 ) + R(H 1 )P(H 1 ) (31) = π 0 R(H 0 ) + π 1 R(H 1 ).</formula><p>Based on classic detection theory (Chapter 2.2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>), the overall Bayes risk R is minimized if and only if:</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">L(ϕ k ) = f (ϕ k |H 1 ) f (ϕ k |H 0 ) H0 ≶ H1 Tr{P b -P a }π 0 Tr{P c -P d }π 1 τ ⋆ ,</formula><p>where τ ⋆ is the optimal threshold of the proposed detector in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. This can be further simplified for the Gaussian case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">ξ 2 k,a = z ′ k,a (Σ -1 H0 -Σ -1 H1 )z k,a H0 ≶ H1 η ⋆ , where η ⋆ 2 ln τ ⋆ + ln det ΣH 1 det ΣH 0 .</formula><p>Remark 4.5: Note that π 0 and π 1 represent the a-priori information of the remote estimator regarding to the attacking probability, which is required for the calculation of the optimal threshold. However, if the a-priori probabilities are unknown, we can replace the test in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> with the Mini-Max Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The results are similar and will be omitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Further Improvement</head><p>Though the required information is different, the proposed two detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> both follow the same estimate updating procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and therefore abandon suspicious data. However, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, since the remote estimator has knowledge about the potential attacking pattern, it may further improve the estimation performance by recover the original data from the suspicious data, which may be intuitively true if we have relatively high detection rate than false alarm rate. To be more specific, we can propose the following estimate updating procedure for detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_82">xk = { xk,s + K k,a ẑk,a , if ξ 2 k,a &gt; η, xk,s + K k,a z k,a , otherwise,<label>(32)</label></formula><p>where ẑk,a</p><formula xml:id="formula_83">E[z k,a |z k,a , T k ] -C a K k,s z k,s , compared with z k,a = zk,a -C a K k,s z k,s .</formula><p>When T k = -I, the remote estimator can perfectly recover the original data by</p><formula xml:id="formula_84">E[z k,a |z k,a , T k = -I] = -z k,a , and ẑk,a = -z k,a -C a K k,s z k,s .</formula><p>In such a case, from Theorem 4.2, we can easily verify that the state estimation error covariance of xk in (32) obeys the following recursion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_85">P k =          P a = P a , if ξ 2 k,a η ∧ H 0 , P b = P c , if ξ 2 k,a &gt; η ∧ H 0 , P c = P c , if ξ 2 k,a η ∧ H 1 , P d = P a , if ξ 2 k,a &gt; η ∧ H 1 ,<label>(33)</label></formula><p>where P a and P c are the same as defined in Theorem 4.2.</p><p>Clearly, compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, the proposed estimate updating procedure in (32) changes the costs for different situations: when the data is modified (H 1 ) and ξ 2 k,a &gt; η, i.e., successful detection, the cost P d is further reduced from P d to P a ; however, on the other hand, when the data is not modified (H 0 ) but ξ 2 k,a &gt; η, i.e., false alarm, the cost P b is further increased from P b to P c . Therefore, to adopt (32), the detector is confronted with a tradeoff between higher detection cost and lower false alarm cost.</p><p>To analyze the performance of (32), similar to (31), denote its corresponding overall Bayes risk as R. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_74">27</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_78">30</ref>) and (33), we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_86">R -R &gt; 0 (34) ⇔ π 0 [ R(H 0 ) -R(H 0 ) ] + π 1 [ R(H 1 ) -R(H 1 ) ] &gt; 0 ⇔ π 0 P F [ Tr{P b -P c } ] + π 1 P D [ Tr{P d -P a } ] &gt; 0 ⇔ P D &gt; βP F ,</formula><p>where β</p><p>Tr{P c -P b }π0</p><p>Tr{P d -P a }π1 . Therefore, when P D &gt; βP F , which may be interpreted intuitively as if we have relatively high detection rate than false alarm rate, we can further improve the estimation performance by recovering the suspicious data as in (32). Otherwise, just abandoning the suspicious data will achieve a better performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATIONS</head><p>In this section, we will present some numerical examples to illustrate our results.</p><p>Consider a two-dimensioned system with parameters: The empirical examples are generated via 10000 Monte Carlo simulations. Typically, the state estimation error covariance will diverge from its original value exponentially fast under constant deception attacks if the remote estimator fails to detect them. Therefore, in the following simulation, the attacks are conducted in a time horizon of 5 time steps and we assume that the process already enters steady state before attacks.</p><formula xml:id="formula_87">A = [ 1.1 -0.6 -0.3 1 ] , C s = C a = [<label>3</label></formula><p>For the given system, the estimation performance under detector in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> (denoted as D1) with different thresholds are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(a)</ref>. With the knowledge of the a-priori information, the estimation performance under the detector in (25) (denoted as D2) is also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>(a) for comparison. For illustration purpose, the estimation performance of using all the sensors assuming they have not been attacked is provided as benchmark 1, the one of using only the safe sensor is provided as benchmark 2, and the one of using sensors that are not modified is denoted as benchmark 3 . Obviously, both detectors D1 and D2 can help improve the estimation performance than only using safe sensors (benchmark 2) by properly choosing the threshold. However, by utilizing extra information, better estimation performance is achieved under (25) (D2) than under (19) (D1), while the gap still exists between them and the performance benchmarks 1 and 2. In our current parameter settings, the condition in (34) is not satisfied, thus we may not achieve a better estimation performance by recovering the original data from the suspicious data due to the high false alarm rate. As a counter-example shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2(b)</ref>, due to the relatively high false alarm rate, the detector with the recovering procedure in (32) may wrongly recover the suspicious data that is not modified, which will result in worse performance even than just utilizing the safe sensors (benchmark 2). Now we consider the same two-dimensioned system with different parameters as π 0 = 0.2, π 1 = 0.8. The condition in (34) is satisfied now and thus we can obtain a better estimation performance by using detector D2 with the recovering procedure. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, detector D2 with the recovering procedure in (32) provides improved performance than detector D2 without the recovering procedure. However, the gap still exists between them and the benchmark 1.   We considered a typical remote estimation process using multiple sensors. To detect the suspicious data sharing the same statistical properties as the original measurements, we proposed three sequential data verification and fusion procedures for different detection information scenarios based on the information extracted from the trusted sensors and correlations among the sensors. The corresponding impacts of possible attacking patterns on the estimation performance under different detectors were analyzed explicitly. Future work directions include investigating the responses of the attacker to the new detector and the dynamic-decision process between the attacker and the estimator under a game-theoretic framework.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
