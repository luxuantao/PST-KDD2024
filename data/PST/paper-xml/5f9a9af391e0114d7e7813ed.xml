<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a successful method for unsupervised graph representation learning.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Over the past few years, graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful strategy for analyzing graph-structured data. Graph representation learning using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has received considerable attention, which aims to transform nodes to low-dimensional dense embeddings that preserve graph attributive and structural features. However, existing GNN models are mostly established in a supervised manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, which require abundant labeled nodes for training. Recently, Contrastive Learning (CL), as revitalization of the classical information maximization (InfoMax) principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, achieves great success in many fields, e.g., visual representation learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> and natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. These CL methods seek to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between the input (i.e. images) and its representations (i.e. image embeddings) by contrasting positive pairs with negative-sampled counterparts.</p><p>Inspired by previous CL methods, Deep Graph InfoMax (DGI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> marries the power of GNN into InfoMax-based methods. DGI firstly augments the original graph by simply shuffling node features. Then, an objective based on MI maximization is proposed to maximize the MI between node embeddings and a global summary embedding. Following DGI, GMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposes two node-level contrastive objectives to directly measure MI between input and representations of nodes and edges respectively, without explicit data augmentation. Moreover, to supplement the input graph with more global information, MVGRL <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposes to augment the input graph using graph diffusion. Then, it constructs graph views by uniformly sampling subgraphs and learns to contrast node representations to global embeddings across the two views.</p><p>Despite the prosperous development of CL methods on graphs, data augmentation schemes, proved to be a critical component for visual representation learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, remain rarely explored in existing literature. Unlike abundant data transformation techniques available for images and texts, graph augmentation schemes are non-trivial to define in CL methods, since graphs are far more complex due to the non-Euclidean property. We argue that the augmentation schemes used in the aforementioned methods suffer from two drawbacks. At first, simple data augmentation in either the structural domain or the attribute domain, such as feature shifting in DGI <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, is not sufficient for generating diverse neighborhoods (i.e. contexts) for nodes, especially when node feature is sparse, leading to difficulty in optimizing the contrastive objective. Secondly, previous work ignores the discrepancy in the impact of nodes and edges when performing data augmentation. For example, if we construct graph views by uniformly dropping edges, removing some influential edges will deteriorate the embedding quality. As the representations learned by the contrastive objective tend to be invariant to corruption induced by the data augmentation scheme We first generate two graph views via stochastic augmentation that is adaptive to the graph structure and attributes. Then, the two graphs are fed into a shared Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn representations. We train the model with a contrastive objective, which pulls representations of one node together while pushing node representations away from other node representations in the two views. N.B., we define the negative samples as all other nodes in the two views. Therefore, negative samples are from two sources, intra-view (in purple) and inter-view nodes (in red). <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, the data augmentation strategies should be adaptive to the input graph to reflect its intrinsic patterns. Again, taking the edge removing scheme as an example, we can give larger probabilities to unimportant edges and lower probabilities to important ones when randomly removing the edges. Then, this scheme is able to guide the model to ignore the introduced noise on unimportant edges and thus learn important patterns underneath the input graph.</p><p>To this end, we propose a novel contrastive framework for unsupervised graph representation learning (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which we refer to as Graph Contrastive learning with Adaptive augmentation, GCA for brevity. In GCA, we first generate two correlated graph views by performing stochastic corruption on the input. Then, we train the model using a contrastive loss to maximize the agreement between node embeddings in these two views. Specifically, we propose a joint data augmentation scheme at both topology and node attribute levels, namely removing edges and masking features, to provide diverse contexts for nodes in different views, so as to boost optimization of the contrastive objective. Moreover, we identify important edges and feature dimensions via centrality measures. Then, on the topology level, we adaptively drop edges by giving large removal probabilities to unimportant edges to highlight important connective structures. On the node attribute level, we corrupt attributes by adding more noise to unimportant feature dimensions, to enforce the model to recognize underlying semantic information.</p><p>The core contribution of this paper is two-fold, which is summarized as follows.</p><p>• Firstly, we propose a general contrastive framework for unsupervised graph representation learning with strong, adaptive data augmentation. The proposed GCA framework jointly performs data augmentation on both topology and attribute levels that are adaptive to the graph structure and attributes, which encourages the model to learn important features from both aspects.</p><p>• Secondly, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies using five public benchmark datasets on node classification under the commonly-used linear evaluation protocol. GCA consistently outperforms existing methods and our unsupervised method even surpasses its supervised counterparts on several transductive tasks.</p><p>The remaining of the paper includes the following sections. We briefly review related work in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the proposed GCA model in detail. The results of the experiments are analyzed in Section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5. For readers of interest, additional configurations of experiments and details of proofs are provided in Appendix A and B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we briefly review prior work on contrastive representation learning. Then, we review graph representation learning methods. At last, we provide a summary of comparisons between the proposed method and existing related work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Contrastive Representation Learning</head><p>Being popular in self-supervised representation learning, contrastive methods aim to learn discriminative representations by contrasting positive and negative samples. For visual data, negative samples can be generated using a multiple-stage augmentation pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, consisting of color jitter, random flip, cropping, resizing, rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, color distortion <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, etc. Existing work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> employs a memory bank for storing negative samples. Other work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> explores in-batch negative samples. For an image patch as the anchor, these methods usually find a global summary vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> or patches in neighboring views <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> as the positive sample, and contrast them with negative-sampled counterparts, such as patches of other images within the same batch <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Theoretical analysis sheds light on the reasons behind their success <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Objectives used in these methods can be seen as maximizing the lower bounds of MI between input features and their representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> reveals that downstream performance in evaluating the quality of representations may strongly depend on the bias that is encoded not only in the convolutional architectures but also in the specific estimator of the InfoMax objective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Graph Representation Learning</head><p>Many traditional methods on unsupervised graph representation learning employ the contrastive paradigm as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Prior work on unsupervised graph representation learning focuses on local contrastive patterns, which forces neighboring nodes to have similar embeddings. Positive samples under this circumstance are nodes appearing in the same random walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. For example, the pioneering work DeepWalk <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> models probabilities of node co-occurrence pairs using noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. These random-walk-based methods are proved to be equivalent to factorizing some forms of graph proximity (e.g., transformation of the adjacent matrix) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, which overly emphasize on the structural information encoded in these graph proximities and also face severe scaling problem with large-scale datasets. Also, these methods are known to be error-prone with inappropriate hyperparameter tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>Recent work on graph neural networks (GNN) employs more powerful graph convolutional encoders over conventional methods. Among them, considerable literature has grown up around the theme of supervised GNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, which requires labeled datasets that may not be accessible in real-world applications. Along the other line of development, unsupervised GNNs receive little attention. Representative methods include GraphSAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which incorporates DeepWalk-like objectives. Recent work DGI <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> marries the power of GNN and contrastive learning, which focuses on maximizing MI between global graph embeddings and local node embeddings. Specifically, to implement the InfoMax objective, DGI requires an injective readout function to produce the global graph embedding, where the injective property is too restrictive to fulfill. However, it is hard to fulfill the injective requirement of the graph readout function such that the graph embedding may be deteriorated. In contrast to DGI, previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> proposes to not rely on an explicit graph embedding, but rather focus on maximizing the agreement of node embeddings across two corrupted views of the graph.</p><p>Following DGI, GMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> employs two discriminators to directly measure MI between input and representations of both nodes and edges without data augmentation; MVGRL <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposes to learn both node-level and graph-level representations by performing node diffusion and contrasting node representations to augmented graph summary representations. Moreover, GCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposes a pretraining framework based on contrastive learning. It proposes to construct multiple graph views by sampling subgraphs based on random walks and then learn model weights with several feature engineering schemes. However, these methods do not explicitly consider adaptive graph augmentation at both structural and attribute levels, leading to suboptimal performance. Unlike these work, the adaptive data augmentation at both topology and attribute levels used in our GCA is able to preserve important patterns underneath the graph through stochastic perturbation.</p><p>Summary of comparisons with related graph contrastive learning methods. In summary, we provide a brief comparison between the  <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, GMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and MVGRL <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, where the two columns "Topology" and "Attribute" denote data augmentation strategies at both levels. It is seen that the proposed GCA method simplifies previous nodeglobal contrastive scheme by defining contrastive objective at the node level. Most importantly, GCA is the only one that proposes adaptive data augmentation on both topology and attribute levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE PROPOSED METHOD</head><p>In this section, we present GCA in detail, starting with the overall contrastive learning framework, followed by the proposed adaptive graph augmentation schemes. Finally, we provide theoretical justification behind our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preliminaries</head><p>Let G = (V, E) denote a graph, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V = {𝑣 1 , 𝑣 2 , • • • , 𝑣 𝑁 }, E ⊆</formula><p>V × V represent the node set and the edge set respectively. We denote the feature matrix and the adjacency matrix as 𝑿 ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝐹 and 𝑨 ∈ {0, 1} 𝑁 ×𝑁 , where 𝒙 𝑖 ∈ R 𝐹 is the feature of 𝑣 𝑖 , and 𝑨 𝑖 𝑗 = 1 iff (𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 ) ∈ E. There is no given class information of nodes in G during training in the unsupervised setting. Our objective is to learn a GNN encoder 𝑓 (𝑿, 𝑨) ∈ R 𝑁 ×𝐹 ′ receiving the graph features and structure as input, that produces node embeddings in low dimensionality, i.e., 𝐹 ′ ≪ 𝐹 . We denote 𝑯 = 𝑓 (𝑿, 𝑨) as the learned representations of nodes, where 𝒉 𝑖 is the embedding of node 𝑣 𝑖 . These representations can be used in downstream tasks, such as node classification and community detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Contrastive Learning Framework</head><p>The graph contrastive learning framework follows the common graph CL paradigm where the model seeks to maximize the agreement within representations between different views. To be specific, we first generate two graph views by performing stochastic graph augmentation on the input. Then, we employ a contrastive objective that enforces the encoded embeddings of each node in the two different views agree with each other and can be distinguished from embeddings of other nodes. In our GCA model, at each iteration, we sample two stochastic augmentation function 𝑡 ∼ T and 𝑡 ′ ∼ T , where T is the set of all possible augmentation functions. Then, we generate two graph views, denoted as 𝐺 1 = 𝑡 ( 𝐺 ) and 𝐺 2 = 𝑡 ′ ( 𝐺 ), and denote node embeddings in the two generated views as 𝑼 = 𝑓 ( 𝑿 1 , 𝑨 1 ) and 𝑽 = 𝑓 ( 𝑿 2 , 𝑨 2 ), where 𝑿 * and 𝑨 * are the feature matrices and adjacent matrices of the views.</p><p>After that, we employ a contrastive objective, i.e. a discriminator, that distinguishes the embeddings of the same node in these two different views from other node embeddings. For any node 𝑣 𝑖 , its embedding generated in one view, 𝒖 𝑖 , is treated as the anchor, the embedding of it generated in the other view, 𝒗 𝑖 , forms the positive sample, and the other embeddings in the two views are naturally regarded as negative samples. Mirroring the InfoNCE objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> in our multi-view graph contrastive learning setting, we define the pairwise objective for each positive pair (𝒖 𝑖 , 𝒗 𝑖 ) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ℓ (𝒖 𝑖 , 𝒗 𝑖 ) = log 𝑒 𝜃 (𝒖 𝑖 ,𝒗 𝑖 )/𝜏 𝑒 𝜃 (𝒖 𝑖 ,𝒗 𝑖 )/𝜏 positive pair + ∑︁ 𝑘≠𝑖 𝑒 𝜃 (𝒖 𝑖 ,𝒗 𝑘 )/𝜏</formula><p>inter-view negative pairs</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">+ ∑︁ 𝑘≠𝑖 𝑒 𝜃 (𝒖 𝑖 ,𝒖 𝑘 )/𝜏 intra-view negative pairs ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝜏 is a temperature parameter. We define the critic 𝜃 (𝒖, 𝒗) = 𝑠 (𝑔(𝒖), 𝑔(𝒗)), where 𝑠 (•, •) is the cosine similarity and 𝑔(•) is a nonlinear projection to enhance the expression power of the critic <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. The projection function 𝑔 in our method is implemented with a two-layer perceptron model. Given a positive pair, we naturally define negative samples as all other nodes in the two views. Therefore, negative samples come from two sources, that are inter-view and intra-view nodes, corresponding to the second and the third term in the denominator in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>), respectively. Since two views are symmetric, the loss for another view is defined similarly for ℓ (𝒗 𝑖 , 𝒖 𝑖 ). The overall objective to be maximized is then defined as the average over all positive pairs, formally given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">J = 1 2𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 [ℓ (𝒖 𝑖 , 𝒗 𝑖 ) + ℓ (𝒗 𝑖 , 𝒖 𝑖 )] .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>To sum up, at each training epoch, GCA first draws two data augmentation functions 𝑡 and 𝑡 ′ , and then generates two graph views G 1 = 𝑡 (G) and G 2 = 𝑡 ′ (G) of graph G. Then, we obtain node representations 𝑼 and 𝑽 of G 1 and G 2 using a GNN encoder 𝑓 . Finally, the parameters are updated by maximizing the objective in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>). The training algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. Update parameters by applying stochastic gradient ascent to maximize J</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Adaptive Graph Augmentation</head><p>In essence, contrastive learning methods that maximize agreement between views seek to learn representation that is invariant to perturbation introduced by the augmentation schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In the model, we propose to design augmentation schemes that tend to keep important structures and attribute unchanged while perturbing possibly unimportant links and features. Specifically, we corrupt the input graph by randomly removing edges and masking node features in the graph, and the removing or masking probabilities are skewed for unimportant edges or features, that is, higher for unimportant edges or features, and lower for important ones. From an amortized perspective, we emphasize important structures and attributes over randomly corrupted views, which will guide the model to preserve fundamental topological and semantic graph patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Topology-level augmentation.</head><p>For topology level augmentation, we consider a direct way for corrupting input graphs where we randomly remove edges in the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Formally, we sample a modified subset E from the original E with probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑃 {(𝑢, 𝑣) ∈ E } = 1 − 𝑝 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈ E and 𝑝 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 is the probability of removing (𝑢, 𝑣). E is then used as the edge set in the generated view. 𝑝 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 should reflect the importance of the edge (𝑢, 𝑣) such that the augmentation function are more likely to corrupt unimportant edges while keep important connective structures intact in augmented views.</p><p>In network science, node centrality is a widely-used measure that quantifies the influence of nodes in the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. We define edge centrality 𝑤 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 for edge (𝑢, 𝑣) to measure its influence based on centrality of two connected nodes. Given a node centrality measure 𝜑 𝑐 (•) : V → R + , we define edge centrality as the average of two adjacent nodes' centrality, i.e. 𝑤 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 = (𝜑 𝑐 (𝑢)+𝜑 𝑐 (𝑣)) /2, and on directed graph, we simply use the centrality of the tail node, i.e. 𝑤 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 = 𝜑 𝑐 (𝑣), since the importance of edges is generally characterized by nodes they are pointing to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Next, we calculate the probability of each edge based on its centrality value. Since node centrality values like degrees may vary across orders of magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, we first set 𝑠 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 = log 𝑤 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 to alleviate the impact of nodes with heavily dense connections. The probabilities can then be obtained after a normalization step that transform the values into valid probabilities, which is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝑝 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 = min 𝑠 𝑒 max − 𝑠 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 𝑠 𝑒 max − 𝜇 𝑒 𝑠 • 𝑝 𝑒 , 𝑝 𝜏 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝑝 𝑒 is a hyperparameter that controls the overall probability of removing edges, 𝑠 𝑒 max is the maximum value of 𝑠 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 and 𝜇 𝑒 𝑠 is the average. 𝑝 𝜏 &lt; 1 is a cut-off probability. It is used to truncate the probabilities since overly-high removal probabilities may damage the graph structure.</p><p>For the choice of the node centrality function, we use the following three centrality measures, including degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and PageRank centrality due to their simplicity and effectiveness. Degree centrality. Node degree itself can be a centrality measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. On directed networks, we use in-degrees since the influence of a node in directed graphs are mostly bestowed by nodes pointing at it <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Despite that the node degree is one of the simplest centrality measures, it is quite effective and illuminating. For example, in citation networks where nodes represent papers and edges represent citation relationships, nodes with the highest degrees in citation networks are likely to correspond to influential papers.</p><p>Eigenvector centrality. The eigenvector centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> of a node is calculated as its eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. Unlike degree centrality, which assumes that all neighbors contribute equally to the importance of the node, eigenvector centrality also takes the importance of neighboring nodes into consideration. By definition, the eigenvector centrality of each node is proportional to the sum of centralities of its neighbors, nodes that are either connected to many neighbors or connected to influential nodes will have high eigenvector centrality values. On directed graphs, we use the right eigenvector to compute the centrality, which corresponds to incoming edges. Note that since only the leading eigenvector is needed, the computational burden for calculating the eigenvector centrality is negligible.</p><p>PageRank centrality. The PageRank centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> is defined as the PageRank weights computed by the PageRank algorithm. The algorithm propagate influence along directed edges, and nodes that gather most influence are regarded as important nodes. Formally, the centrality values are defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝝈 = 𝛼𝑨𝑫 −1 𝝈 + 1,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝜎 ∈ R 𝑁 is the vector of PageRank centrality scores for each node and 𝛼 is the damping factor that prevents sinks in the graph from absorbing all ranks from other nodes connected to the sinks. We set 𝛼 = 0.85 as suggested in Page et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.

Formally, we first sample a random vector 𝒎 ∈ {0, 1} 𝐹 where each dimension of it independently is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution, i.e., 𝑚 𝑖 ∼ B (1 − 𝑝 𝑓 𝑖 ), ∀𝑖.

Similar to topology level augmentation, the probability 𝑝 𝑓 𝑖 should reflect the importance of the 𝑖-th dimension of node features. We assume that feature dimensions frequently appearing in influential nodes should are important, and define the weights of feature dimensions as follows.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Theoretical Justification</head><p>In this section, we provide theoretical justification behind our model from two perspectives, i.e. the mutual information maximization and the triplet loss. Detailed proofs can be found in Appendix B.</p><p>Connections to the mutual information. Firstly, we reveal the connections between our loss and mutual information maximization between node features and the embeddings in the two views, which has been widely applied in the representation learning literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. MI quantifies the amount of information obtained about one random variable by observing the other random variable. Theorem 1. Let X 𝑖 = {𝒙 𝑘 } 𝑘 ∈N (𝑖) be the neighborhood of node 𝑣 𝑖 that collectively maps to its output embedding, where N (𝑖) denotes the set of neighbors of node 𝑣 𝑖 specified by GNN architectures, and X be the corresponding random variable with a uniform distribution 𝑝 (X 𝑖 ) =<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> /𝑁 . Given two random variables U, V ∈ R 𝐹 ′ being the embedding in the two views, with their joint distribution denoted as 𝑝 (U, V), our objective J is a lower bound of MI between encoder input X and node representations in two graph views U, V. Formally, J ≤ 𝐼 (X; U, V).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">)<label>10</label></formula><p>Proof sketch. We first observe that our objective J is a lower bound of the InfoNCE objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, which is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. According to van den Oord et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, the InfoNCE estimator is a lower bound of the true MI. Therefore, the theorem directly follows from the application of data processing inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which states that 𝐼 (U; V) ≤ 𝐼 (X; U, V). □</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝐼 NCE (U; V) ≜ E 𝑖 𝑝 (𝒖 𝑖 ,𝒗 𝑖 ) 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 log 𝑒 𝜃 (𝒖 𝑖 ,𝒗 𝑖 ) 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑗 =1 𝑒 𝜃 (𝒖 𝑖 ,𝒗 𝑗 )</formula><p>Remark. Theorem 1 reveals that maximizing J is equivalent to explicitly maximizing a lower bound of the mutual information 𝐼 (X; U, V) between input node features and learned node representations. Recent work further provides empirical evidence that optimizing a stricter bound of MI may not lead to better downstream performance on visual representation learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, which further highlights the importance of the design of data augmentation strategies.</p><p>When optimizing 𝐼 (𝑼 ; 𝑽 ), a lower bound of 𝐼 (𝑿 ; 𝑼 , 𝑽 ), we encourage the model to encode shared information between the two views. Since our proposed adaptive augmentation can preserve fundamental topological and semantic patterns from the amortized perspective, corrupted views will follow a skewed distribution where important link structures and features are emphasized. By contrasting views from the skewed distribution, the model is enforced to encode the emphasized information into the representation, which improves embedding quality.</p><p>Connections to the triplet loss. Alternatively, we may also view the optimization problem in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) as a classical triplet loss, commonly used in deep metric learning. Theorem 2. When the projection function 𝑔 is the identity function and we measure embedding similarity by simply taking the inner product, i.e., 𝑠 (𝒖, 𝒗) = 𝒖 ⊤ 𝒗, and further assuming that positive pairs are far more aligned than negative pairs, minimizing the pairwise objective ℓ (𝒖 𝑖 , 𝒗 𝑖 ) coincides with maximizing the triplet loss, as given in the sequel</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">− ℓ (𝒖 𝑖 , 𝒗 𝑖 ) ∝ 4𝑁𝜏 + ∑︁ 𝑗≠𝑖 ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒗 𝑖 ∥ 2 − ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒗 𝑗 ∥ 2 + ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒗 𝑖 ∥ 2 − ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒖 𝑗 ∥ 2 . (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>Remark. Theorem 2 draws connections between the objective and the classical triplet loss. In other words, we may regard the problem in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) as learning graph convolutional encoders to encourage positive samples being further away from negative samples in the embedding space. Moreover, by viewing the objective from the metric learning perspective, we highlight the importance of appropriate data augmentation schemes, which is often neglected in previous InfoMax-based methods. Specifically, as the objective pulls together representation of each node in the two corrupted views, the model is enforced to encode information in the input graph that is insensitive to perturbation. Since the proposed adaptive augmentation schemes tend to keep important link structures and node attributes intact in the perturbation, the model is guided to encode essential structural and semantic information into the representation, which improves the quality of embeddings. Last, the contrastive objective used in GCA is cheap to optimize, since we do not have to generate negative samples explicitly and all computation can be performed in parallel. In contrast, the triplet loss is known to be computationally expensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Performance on Node Classification (RQ1)</head><p>The empirical performance is summarized in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Overall, from the table, we can see that our proposed model shows strong performance across all five datasets. GCA consistently performs better than unsupervised baselines by considerable margins on both transductive tasks. The strong performance verifies the superiority of the proposed contrastive learning framework. On the two Coauthor datasets, we note that existing baselines have already obtained high enough performance; our method GCA still pushes that boundary forward. Moreover, we particularly note that GCA is competitive with models trained with label supervision on all five datasets.</p><p>We make other observations as follows. Firstly, the performance of traditional contrastive learning methods like DeepWalk is inferior to the simple logistic regression classifier that only uses raw features on some datasets (Coauthor-CS and Coauthor-Physics), which suggests that these methods may be ineffective in utilizing node features. Unlike traditional work, we see that GCN-based methods, e.g., GAE, are capable of incorporating node features when learning embeddings. However, we note that on certain datasets (Wiki-CS), their performance is still worse than DeepWalk + feature, which we believe can be attributed to their naïve method of selecting negative samples that simply chooses contrastive pairs based on edges. This fact further demonstrates the important role of selecting negative samples based on augmented graph views in contrastive representation learning. Moreover, compared to existing baselines DGI, GMI, and MVGRL, our proposed method performs strong, Table <ref type="table">3</ref>: Summary of performance on node classification in terms of accuracy in percentage (on transductive tasks) or microaveraged F1 score (on inductive tasks) with standard deviation.

Please kindly note that the result indicates that our model is not limited to specific choices of centrality measures and verifies the effectiveness and generality of our proposed framework.</p><p>In summary, the superior performance of GCA compared to existing state-of-the-art methods verifies the effectiveness of our proposed GCA framework that performs data augmentation adaptive to the graph structure and attributes.</p></div>

GCA-T-A denotes the model with uniform topology and node attribute level augmentation schemes, where the probabilities of dropping edge and masking features are set to the same for all nodes. The variants GCA-T and GCA-A is defined similarly except that we substitute the topology and the node attribute augmentation scheme with uniform sampling in the two models respectively. Degree centrality is used in all the variants for fair comparison.</p><p>The results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, where we can see that both topology-level and node-attribute-level adaptive augmentation scheme improve model performance consistently on all datasets. In addition, the combination of adaptive augmentation schemes on the two levels further benefits the performance. On the Amazon-Computers dataset, our proposed GCA gains 1.5% absolute improvement compared to the base model with no adaptive augmentation enabled. The results verify the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive augmentation schemes on both topology and node attribute levels.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Sensitivity Analysis (RQ3)</head><p>In this section, we perform sensitivity analysis on critical hyperparameters in GCA, namely four probabilities 𝑝 𝑒,1 , 𝑝 𝑓 ,1 , 𝑝 𝑒,2 , and 𝑝 𝑓 ,2 that determine the generation of graph views to show the model stability under the perturbation of these hyperparameters.</p><p>We conduct transductive node classification by varying these parameters from 0.1 to 0.9. For sake of visualization brevity, we set 𝑝 𝑒 = 𝑝 𝑒,1 = 𝑝 𝑒,2 and 𝑝 𝑓 = 𝑝 𝑓 ,1 = 𝑝 𝑓 ,2 . In other words, 𝑝 𝑒 and 𝑝 𝑓 control the magnitude of the proposed topology and node attribute level augmentation. Note that we only change these four parameters in the sensitivity analysis, and other parameters remain the same as previously described.</p><p>The results on the Amazon-Photo dataset are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>. From the figure, it can be observed that the performance of node classification in terms of accuracy is relatively stable when the parameters are not too large, as shown in the plateau in the figure. We thus conclude that, overall, our model is insensitive to these probabilities, demonstrating the robustness to hyperparameter tuning. If the probability is set too large (e.g., &gt; 0.5), the original graph will be heavily undermined. For example, when 𝑝 𝑒 = 0.9, almost every existing edge has been removed, leading to isolated nodes in the generated graph views. Then, under such circumstances, the graph convolutional network is hard to learn useful information from node neighborhoods. Therefore, the learned node embeddings in the two graph views are not distinctive enough, which will result in the difficulty of optimizing the contrastive objective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have developed a novel graph contrastive representation learning framework with adaptive augmentation. Our model learns representation by maximizing the agreement of node embeddings between views that are generated by adaptive graph augmentation. The proposed adaptive augmentation scheme first identify important edges and feature dimensions via centrality measures. Then, on the topology level, we randomly remove edges by assigning large probabilities on unimportant edges to enforce the model to recognize important connective structures. On the node attribute level, we corrupt attributes by adding more noise to unimportant feature dimensions to emphasize the underlying semantic information. We have conducted comprehensive experiments using various real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and even surpasses several supervised counterparts.</p></div>

Based on the assumptions, we can rearrange the pairwise objective as−ℓ (𝒖 𝑖 , 𝒗 𝑖 ) = − log 𝑒 (𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒗 𝑖 /𝜏) 𝑁 𝑘=1 𝑒 (𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒗 𝑘 /𝜏) + 𝑁 𝑘≠𝑖 𝑒 (𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒖 𝑘 /𝜏) of first order, − ℓ (𝒖 𝑖 , 𝒗 𝑖 ) ≈ 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑘≠𝑖 exp 𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒗 𝑘 − 𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒗 𝑖 𝜏 + 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑘≠𝑖 exp 𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒖 𝑘 − 𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒗 𝑖 𝜏 𝑖 𝒗 𝑘 − 𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒗 𝑖 ) + 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑘≠𝑖 (𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒖 𝑘 − 𝒖 ⊤ 𝑖 𝒗 𝑖 ) 𝑖 − 𝒗 𝑘 ∥ 2 − ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒗 𝑖 ∥ 2 + ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒖 𝑘 ∥ 2 − ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒗 𝑖 ∥ 4𝑁𝜏 + 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑘≠𝑖 ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒗 𝑖 ∥ 2 − ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒗 𝑘 ∥ 2 + ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒗 𝑖 ∥ 2 − ∥𝒖 𝑖 − 𝒖 𝑘 ∥ 2 ,(25)which concludes the proof. □</figDesc></figure>
