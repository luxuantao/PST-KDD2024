<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nowadays we are living the apogee of the Internet based technologies and consequently web 2.0 communities, where a large number of users interact in real time and share opinions and knowledge, is a generalized phenomenon. This type of social networks communities constitute a challenge scenario from the point of view of Group Decision Making approaches, because it involves a large number of agents coming from different backgrounds and/or with different level of knowledge and influence. In these type of scenarios there exists two main key issues that requires attention.</p><p>Firstly, the large number of agents and their diverse background may lead to uncertainty and or inconsistency and so, it makes difficult to assess the quality of the information provided as well as to merge this information. Secondly, it is desirable, or even indispensable depending on the situation, to obtain a solution accepted by the majority of the members or at least to asses the existing level of agreement. In this contribution we address these two main issues by bringing together both decision Making approaches and opinion dynamics to develop a similarity-confidence-consistency based Social network that enables the agents to provide their opinions with the possibility of allocating uncertainty by means of the Intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations and at the same time interact with like-minded agents in order to achieve an agreement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Traditionally Group Decision Making, GDM, has been regarded as a process in which a reduced group of experts interact in order to chose the best alternatives between all the available ones. Indeed</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>this is still the case in many companies and administrations where important decisions are made by a reduced board of specialists. However, nowadays, societal demands and technological advancements are leading us to a global and interconnected society where thousands and even millions of users are sharing thoughts, opinions and preferences that can well lead to a global large scale decision making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">63]</ref>, in what is is denominated a social network, A social network can be regarded as a set of people, or groups of people interacting with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. In politics some efforts are being taken in order to involve citizens in global decision in what is being called e-democracy, e-Governance and public deliberation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44]</ref>. For example, the European Commission has initiated the platform called The European citizens' initiative, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that allows one million EU citizens to participate directly in the development of EU policies, by calling on the European Commission to make a legislative proposal.</p><p>Social Networks are characterized for having a large and heterogeneous user base with low an intermittent participation rates and so a high degree of uncertainty related with them needs to be taken into consideration when modelling a large scale decision making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. In this particular, Intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations, based on Intuitionistic Fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, suppose an interesting framework for the agents to express their judgements, since they allow them to allocate certain levels of uncertainty in their opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54]</ref>.</p><p>One of the main challenges in any GDM scenario consists in achieving a full and unanimous agreement among all the agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. However, in the majority of the occasions this is not reachable in practice, and so alternative approaches comes in to play such as the so called softer consensus measures, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. These approaches define the consensus process as a dynamic and iterative group negotiation with the purpose of bringing the agents opinions closer and so they better represent the human perception of the essence of consensus. In these approaches both the agents consistency, that is the coherence of the opinions, and the similarity among the agents, to asses the agreement existing between them, are used to guide the negotiations, providing suggestions to the agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57]</ref>.</p><p>In the majority of the negotiations processes to reach consensus in web communities the agents are not homogeneous <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">63]</ref>, that is, they present different expertise, participation rates and selfconfidence levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>, however classical group decision making provides equal feedback mechanisms to all of them without taking into consideration their peculiarities with respect to self confidence and influence.With this regard, a recent survey in Social Network based consensus approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> classifies these methodologies in two main paradigms, the ones based on trust relationships, and the ones based on opinion evolution, pointing out that the later are still in an early stage whereas the former lacks of tools to calculate dynamically the inter experts trust and influence.</p><p>When dealing with inter-expert influence we can keep in mind that according to Guha et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T in any real field decision making situation when agents give their responses to a particular alternative, their self confidence level regarding the opinions plays a key role. In fact, according to various researches the members of the groups composed of freely iterating individuals often decide to choose the positions of their most confident members as their group decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. Consequently confidence can be considered as a relevant indicator of influence and so it needs to be taken into account in the negotiation processes to reach consensus. <ref type="bibr">Liu et al. in</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> propose an optimization approach to estimate the collective preference vector when using heterogeneous preference relations with self-confidence assessment. However, this model does not take into consideration the agents confidence nor to increase the consensus nor to carry out the aggregation of the information and it increase the complexity of the decision process forcing the agents to provide another value to asses their confidence. On the contrary Urena et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref> propose an approach that directly computes the agents degree of confidence from their opinions expressed by means of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Preference Relations, IFPRs.</p><p>Apart form confidence, on opinion dynamics procedures, users can be either opinion leaders who are the agents who can exert influence on the opinions, and ordinary agents or followers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. With this regard, in the propagation process of public opinion, the formers have a profound impact on the opinion formation of the followers even helping to the faster propagations of opinions in a network <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Bounded confidence based approaches construct opinion dynamics models <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref> to analyse the influence of opinion leaders in social networks revealing that, as long as the confidence levels of ordinary agents in a social group are sufficiently high, even if the initial opinions of the ordinary agents are dissimilar to those of the opinion leaders, the opinion leaders are eventually able to guide the ordinary agents to accept their desired opinions and so to reach a consensus solution.</p><p>Therefore, in decision making scenarios it is key to recognize which are the different profiles of the agents, influencers and followers, and provide selective recommendations in consequence. With this regard, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> it is presented a consensus model that deals with heterogeneous agents, and so it adjust the level of feedback depending on a pre-given value of agents importance. Whereas a trust based consensus approach where the recommendations are provided to the agents by means of a trust network is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref>. However both of this approaches require extra information, either the confidence, either the degree of importance of the agents or the trust. However, for e-decision applications or, in general, web communities when carrying out decision making extra information apart from the agents opinion it is hard to get and so the challenge is to develop mechanisms to infer the agents influence and confidence directly from their opinions, and from that, develop a network of influence in which the agents presenting higher consistency in their opinions as well as higher levels of self confidence are placed in the most influential positions of the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Another challenge deals with the agents reluctance to accept the advice given during the negotiation , that implies that providing feedback does not mean that the agents are going to accept the suggestions given. With this regard in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> it has been proposed a self-management mechanism to generate experts' weights dynamically in order to fuse all the agents opinions. This procedure relies in an a priori inter-experts evaluation to asses the experts influence and so it may not be suitable for large scale systems in which the agents may not know each others and so they are unable to provide pairwise experts evaluations. However bounded confidence opinion dynamics mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref> state that the individuals rely on the opinions and social appraisal supported from people with similar interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> and so in order to ensure agents to take into account the advice, this recommendations should come from others like-minded agents. According to a recent survey in opinion dynamics procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> it is interesting to develop mechanisms that brings the gap between opinion dynamics procedures and social network GDM approaches dealing at the same time with malicious and reluctant agents.</p><p>In summary, large scale group decision making constitute a complex scenario in which the uncertainty associated to the heterogeneity of the agents as well as the potential reluctance of some agents to change their view point make the opinions propagation with the objective of reaching consensus a challenging tasks. However the role of influencers and like-minded agents or agents in the network is key in to successfully propagate the opinions and to reach a solution accepted by the majority of the agents.</p><p>In this contribution, we model the consensus reaching problem as a social influence network in which each node constitutes one expert represented by its opinions and whose influence will be inferred from its consistency and confidence. Furthermore we present a networked feedback spreading mechanism inspired by the aforementioned bounded confidence opinion dynamics mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">59]</ref> to support agents to change some of their preference values in order to achieve a general consensus.</p><p>The main novelties presented in this contribution with respect to the ones in the literature that also uses experts dynamic weight calculation like the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> are twofold: First of all in the proposed approach the inter-agents influence is calculated taking into consideration only the agents opinions in each iteration, without the necessity of other inter experts measure. Therefore this approach works in large scale decision making processes in which the agents do not have an apriori opinion of other agents. Secondly, the proposed approach is able to classify the agents in different profiles, pointing out the influencers and allocating them a preponderant position in the network, and isolating those that may present a malicious behaviour. Personalized advice is delivered to each expert according to its profile and its position in the network with the objective of both increasing the consistency of the The rest of the paper is set out as follows: Section 2 presents the main mathematical frameworks in both group decision making and opinion dynamics scenarios We present the new proximity based social network for feedback propagation in Section 3. In Section 4 we integrate the proposed network in a Group decision making scenario and we validate the model through extensive simulations. Finally in Section 5 we expose the conclusions of our work as well as pointing out future research challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>This section is composed of two subsections, in the first one , the mathematical frameworks in Group Decision Making are described whereas the main opinion dynamics procedures are described in the second one</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">GDM frameworks</head><p>In decision making processes that involve several agents, they provide their preferences on the set of available alternatives (X). Different ways of carrying out this comparison when expressing preferences are thoroughly analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, concluding that the most accurate approaches consist on pairwise comparison since they allow the decision makers to take into consideration only two alternatives at a time. This pairwise comparison can lead to three different preference states namely: preference of one alternative to the other, indifference between them or impossibility of expressing them.</p><p>There exist two main mathematical approaches based on the concept of preference relation. On the one hand, the first approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45]</ref> proposes to define a preference relation for each one of the three possible preference states. On the other hand, the second one integrates the three possible preference states into a single preference relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposing the following definition of preference relation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Preference Relation). A preference relation P on a set X is a binary relation µ</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">P : X × X → D,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>where D is the domain of representation of preference degrees provided by the decision maker.</head><p>Therefore, a preference relation P constitutes a matrix P = (p i j ) of dimension #X, in which p i j = µ P (x i , x j ) is the degree or intensity of preference of alternative x i over x j . The elements of P could be numeric or linguistic depending on the type of decision making process that is being carried out. Indeed, for the case of numeric preference relations the main types used in decision making approaches are: crisp preference relations, additive preference relations, multiplicative preference relations, interval-valued preference relations and intuitionistic preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref>. Among them,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>in this contribution we will focus on intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations since they allow the agents to express their uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Fuzzy Set and Intuitionistic Fuzzy Preference Relation</head><p>Definition 2 (Fuzzy Set). Let U be a universal set defined in a specific problem, with a generic element denoted by x. A fuzzy set X in U is a set of ordered pairs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X = (x, µ X (x))|x ∈ U</formula><p>where µ X : U → [0, 1] is called the membership function of A and µ X (x) represents the degree of membership of the element x in X.</p><p>The degree of non-membership of the element x in X is here defined as ν X (x) = 1 -µ X (x). Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">µ X (x) + ν X (x) = 1.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 3 (Fuzzy Preference Relation).</head><p>A fuzzy preference relation R = (r i j ) on a finite set of alternatives X is a fuzzy relation in X × X that is characterized by a membership function µ R : X × X -→ [0, 1] with the following interpretation:</p><p>• r i j = 1 indicates the maximum degree of preference for x i over x j • r i j ∈]0.5, 1[ indicates a definite preference for x i over x j</p><p>• r i j = 1/2 indicates indifference between x i and x j When r i j + r ji = 1 ∀i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} is imposed the fuzzy preference relation is called reciprocal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Consistency of fuzzy preference relations</head><p>Consistency of fuzzy preference relations is related with the transitivity in the pairwise comparison among any three alternatives, that is, if alternative x i is preferred to alternative x j ( x i x j ) and this one is preferred to x k ( x j x k ) then alternative x i should be preferred to x k ( x i x k ), which is normally referred to as weak stochastic transitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Any property that ensures the transitivity of the preferences can be denominated as a consistency property. Obviously, the lack of consistency in decision making can lead to not coherent information, therefore it is necessary to develop measures to asses the consistency levels in the opinions of the agents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>. Several properties have been suggested as rational conditions to be verified by a consistent fuzzy preference relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>, among</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>them we can point out the followings: triangle condition, weak transitivity, max-min transitivity, maxmax transitivity, restricted max-min transitivity, restricted max-max transitivity, additive transitivity, and multiplicative transitivity. Particularly in our approach we will focus on Tanino's Multiplicative transitivity property to model consistency.</p><p>Definition 4 (Multiplicative transitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>). A fuzzy preference relation R = (r i j ) on a finite set of alternatives X is multiplicative transitive if and only if</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">r i j • r jk • r ki = r ik • r k j • r ji ∀i, k, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . n}<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The preference value between a pair of alternatives (x i , x j ) with (i &lt; j) can be estimated, using another different intermediate alternative x k (k = i, j) by means of the multiplicative consistency property (1) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">mr k i j = r ik • r k j • r ji r jk • r ki (2)</formula><p>Given a non zero denominator, mr k i j is one of the partially multiplicative transitivity based estimated fuzzy preference values of the pair of alternatives (x i , x j ) given the intermediate alternative x k . The average of all possible estimated values of the pair of alternatives (x i , x j ) is considered as the global multiplicative transitivity based fuzzy preference relation value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">mr i j = ∑ k∈R 01 i j mr k i j #R 01 i j ;</formula><p>where R 01 i j = {k = i, j|(r ik , r k j ) / ∈ R 01 }, R 01 = {(1, 0), (0, 1)}, and #R 01 i j is the cardinality of R 01 i j . Consequently, for every fuzzy preference relation, R = (r i j ), we can estimate the multiplicative transitivity based fuzzy preference relation, MR = (mr i j ). Notice that it has been proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> that when a fuzzy</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">preference relation R = (r i j ) is multiplicative transitive then R = MR. What it is more, if R is multi- plicative then (1) it is verified ∀i, j, k.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 5 (Multiplicative Consistency). A fuzzy preference relation R = (r i j ) is multiplicative consistent if and only if R = MR.</head><p>The degree of similarity existing between the values r i j and mr i j has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> as a measure of the level of consistency existing on a given fuzzy preference relation at three different levels namely pair of alternatives, alternatives and relation. In this contribution we assume that the preference relations are reciprocal, and so we consider only the upper diagonal of the matrix, moreover we define the consistency in only one level as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>Definition 6 (Consistency index on the fuzzy preference relation).</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C T = n ∑ i=1; i = j; j&gt;i 1 -d(r i j , mr i j ) n(n -1)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Where d(r i j , mr i j ) is the distance between the values r i j and mr i j .</p><p>The following results characterize the multiplicative consistency of a fuzzy preference relation using its corresponding consistency level.</p><p>Proposition 1.

Influence weights range from 0 to 1, and the set of weights held by any actor for all group members, including himself or herself, sums to 1. In the standard model, actors' susceptibilities to influence are coupled with the weights they accord to their own opinions (w ii );</p><p>In the FJ Model the actors modify their opinions on an issue by forming a weighted average of group members opinions, including their own, as the micro-level influence process plays out over time. This is supported by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> that empirically proves the assumption that individuals update their opinions as convex combinations of their own and others' displayed opinions, based on weights that are automatically generated by individuals in their responses to the displayed opinions of other individuals.</p><p>Particular cases of the FJ Model are the so called bounded confidence models. According to these models, each agent solely communicates with the agents who hold similar opinions and ignores the ones whose opinions are far. This similarity of opinions can be seen as a confidence level between agents. Therefore in these models, the similarity between agents as well as their initial opinions determine the opinion neighbourhood in which the expert is likely to interact at every instant. The two main bounded confidence-based models are the Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, and the DeffuantWeisbuch (DW) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>.</p><p>These models are composed of three main steps: 1.

Obviously, only using confidence could lead to serious bias or even manipulation in the decision, since it could be the case of an expert reporting high degree of confidence but presenting very incoherent answers motivated by the lack of in depth knowledge or even with a malicious intention. Therefore, apart from confidence, other measures should be taken into account, such as the consistency of the opinions that provides a measure of the coherence, or the quality of the information provided by the agents.</p><p>Apart from that, we should bear in mind that providing suggestions does not mean that the agents will take them into account.

With this regard in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> it has been carried a study that evaluates the impact of the different distance measures in the consensus process concluding that the Manhattan and the Euclidean distances help to increase the consensus level when the number of agents is high. Whereas the Cosine and the Dice distances produce the same results regardless of the number of agents. These measures asses the numerical distance existing between the given preferences without considering if the user prefers or not one alternative. However, it makes sense to believe that the users that prefer the same alternatives are closer between each other than those that even if their alternatives in value are close they prefer different alternatives. In this contribution we propose a new way of assessing the similarity between agents at a global level, taking advantage of the the Jaccard similarity index.

The model is composed of four main phases: (1) Calculation of agents Knowledge Degree and expert profile identification(2) development of an influence network in which the inter expert influence is calculated based on the Knowledge Degree and similarity of the agents ; (2) Calculation of the level consensus among all the agents (3)Influence based information fusion and feedback spreading in the network (4) Resolution process.</p><p>• Phase 1, Calculation of agents knowledge degree and expert profile identification: In this phase the quality of the information provided by each expert, that is, the consistency is assess, as well as the agents self confidence, as referred in section 2.1.2 and 2.1.4 respectively. These measurements are applied to calculate the agents KD in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and to classify them as HCC, MCC and LCC as agents as referred in section 3.1.</p><p>• Phase 2, Development of the influence network: By referring to Section 3.3, a novel influence network is built. This network is represented as a directed graph in which the influence of each expert is based in the similarity between the agents opinions, detailed in section 3.2, and their</p></div>

The expert's profile is taken into consideration to asses the agents influence in the network in terms of providing and receiving advise. The proposed similarity measure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> expresses the strength of agents connections sharing most similar preferences, known as structural equivalence relation.</p><p>• Phase 3, Influence network based feedback mechanism: When the group consensus is not high enough, i.e. it is lower than a threshold value representing consensus reaching state, a feedback mechanism phase that integrates both SNA and GDM methodologies is proposed as referred in section 3.4. This influence based feedback approach consist on a recommendation system that focuses on the agents who present less confidence and consistency in their opinions, MCC and LCC agents, and that are guided the HCC agents that presents the highest influence in the network. In order to fuse the information and to provide personalized recommendation to each expert based on the agents in his/her vicinity we propose to use the new KD-IOWA defined in (def. 17).</p><p>• Phase 4, Resolution process: Finally all expert preferences are fused into one collective preference relation by means of the KD-IOWA that induces the ordering of the preferences to aggregate based on the agents influence in the network. The exploitation procedure is then carried out by implementing the OWA quantifier guided dominance degree (QGDD) to derive the final ranking of alternatives from which the maximum dominance element is chosen as the solution of consensus for "most of" the agents in the network.</p><p>The steps that comply each of the previous phases are detailed in the following:</p><p>Step 1 Experts provide their IFPRs</p><p>Step 2 Confidence and consistency are calculated directly from the opinion of the agents expressed</p><p>Step 3 The opinion of the agents are aggregated and the consensus level is computed. If it is enough the procedure goes to Step 8 to calculate the final ranking of the alternatives, otherwise it continues with Step 4</p><p>Step 4 The profile of each expert is computed, HCC, MCC and LCC</p><p>Step 5 The adjacency matrix for the network is calculated taking into account both the proximity between agents, and their profiles</p><p>Step 6 The recommendations for the agents are computed by aggregating the opinions of the agents connected to the one receiving the recommendations. Step 7 The expert will accept the recommendations provided by its vicinity with a probability = probAccept, the system will go to Step 2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Evolution of the network topology</head><p>First of all the evolution of the network topology in subsequent iterations is studied in a normal scenario in which the agents accept the recommendations provided by the network with a medium accept probability. For the sake of simplicity this simulation is carried out with N= 25 agents. The assumptions and parameter setting for this simulation are indicated in table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> illustrates a two dimension reduction of the agents preferences in each of the iterations until a stable state is achieved. This map-like representation allows to identify how the agents opinions are located with respect to each other and how the majority of them converges towards a common solution within the different iterations. However, there exist some exceptions, as is the case of expert number 4, whose opinions remind far from the other agents. This is due to its initial lack of influence in the network and to have opinions far from from the accepted ones.

The colour of the nodes represents the type of expert(deep blue, light blue and light green for HCC, MCC and LCC agents respectively). Note that the networks generated in each iteration exhibit the typical properties of a real world social network namely <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>: 1. The small-world effect, the majority of the pairs of nodes are connected by a short path through the network. 2. The degree distribution follows a power law. More concretely, we can observe the HCC agents present a high-in degree, many nodes are connected to them and so they are the most influential agents in the network, whereas the LCC agents presents a high out-degree but a null in-degree, and therefore they are deeply exposed to the opinions from the other agents without exerting any influence. However, the influence of the LCC agents that get connected to the network may increase as they adopt the advise coming from the network and so they produce higher consistent opinions, for example, expert 15 evolves from LCC to HCC. On the other hand the ones that do not get connected to the network, as it is the case of expert 4, get isolated and so they barely evolve within the iterations, as it is the desired behaviour to deal with malicious users. Obviously the evolution of the expert's influence in the network highly depends on the expert' willingness to accept the recommendations from his neighbours the higher the probability of acceptance p the better the evolution of the influence of the agents.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">4</ref> depicts the evolution of the global consensus and average consistency in the different rounds. Note that the biggest variation is reported during the three first iterations, then the consensus level reminds pretty stable, around 0.95. Therefore we can conclude that the iterations where there is more exchange of opinions between the agents take place during the first three rounds, and them the system converges. The evolution of each agent consistency and the global average consistency experiment a similar behaviour verifying that the proposed system helps to increase the individual consistency level almost to 1.</p><p>The numbers of cluster among the iterations varies between 1 to 2. This is motivated by the existence of expert number 4 that it gets isolated from the rest of the network. The number of clusters depends on the minimum similarity threshold to warranty a communication between agents, the higher the threshold the bigger the resulting number of clusters.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref> depicts the histogram of the consistency level at the beginning of the process, where we can observe that the majority of the agents report levels lower than 0.8 and at the end of the process, where the agents reports consensus levels over 0.95, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach to increase the quality of the opinions provided in the process.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">6</ref> depicts the histogram of the agents profiles, (HCC, MCC,LCC) at the beginning and in the last iteration of the process.

For medium values of α sim the social network progressively changes its topology to a collection of big clusters, however there is still a high level of communication that leads to longer T but still with high values of consensus as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">5</ref>. Finally, for high values of α sim , T decreases since there is less interaction between the agents and so they stabilize faster. However, this low interaction produces lower values of C S , (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">5</ref>) and the network topology is composed of a high number of little clusters as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6</ref>.</p><p>From the point of p we can observe that as p decreases T increases as well, reaching values of T higher than 10 when p is lower than 0.4. However for very low values of p T is very low because, as there is very low adoption probability the agents' opinions barely changes and consequently the system stabilizes very fast, but with very low consensus levels.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">5</ref> reveals the impact of α sim and p on the final global consensus C S reached when the system gets a stable point. For a given value of p as α sim increases C S decreases since the higher the value of α sim the lower the interaction between agents, and therefore lower information exchange to reach a consensus solution. In these scenarios, the ones with high α sim , the network topology is composed by a few number of stables clusters, that interact between each others but do not communicate with external members. Note that even for values of p close to 1, that means that the agents accept all the recommendations, the level of consensus is very low. On the contrary, for medium and low values of α sim the consensus levels are almost 1 even for low values of p, proving that the system is able to converge to a consensus solution even when the agents are more reluctant to change their opinions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>With the wide incursion of networked communication mechanisms in every day life, such as social networks, it is necessary to develop mechanisms to reach decisions taking into consideration the opinions from multiple heterogeneous users in web communities. In addition, many scenarios such as the ones involving e-politics, marketing or e-health require that the majority of the people agrees with the decision. To do so, in this contribution we propose a new similarity based influence social network that leverage the knowledge of the crowds to model the public opinions dynamic and   to reach consensus among the different agents involved in the decision making process. We have conducted extensive simulations to investigate the evolutions of the agents' opinions concluding that the proposed network permits the agents to increase the consistency of their opinions as well as bring their opinions closer in few iterations overcoming the initial reluctance of the agents to change their minds and isolating those agents that might present a malicious behaviour. Moreover It has been proved that when the generated advices are implemented, consensus increases. In fact given that the consensus is bounded this result guarantees the convergence of the feedback process to consensus reaching state.</p><p>The main contributions to the literature of the proposed approach are the following:</p><p>• The proposed approach implements an influence network in which the inter agents influence is calculated by means of a dynamic combination between the similarity in the opinions of the agents as well as each expert confidence and consistency, levels.</p><p>• The system is implemented as a directed graph, and so it allows to point out in each iteration the most influential agents and use their opinions as recommendations to other like-minded agents.</p><p>Moreover the opinions of those agents presenting lower confidence and consistency levels can evolve towards higher influential positions thanks to the advice received.</p><p>• In order to avoid malicious users behaviours the system is able to recognize and isolate those agents with opinions very different from the rest and those whose coherence levels, that is the consistency, are very low. Moreover the use of an IOWA operator that dynamically calculates the ordering of the opinions in the aggregation to provide the personalized feedback avoids malicious user to "learn how the system works" and to take advantage of the system to impose their opinions.</p><p>• This influence network has been applied in a Group decision making process with the purpose of filling the gap between social networks and the classical consensus reach process which is a dynamic and iterative process guided by a moderator and composed by several rounds in which the individuals express, discuss and modify their opinions until reaching an agreed decision.</p><p>In this model we leverage well known opinion dynamics models to carry out opinion diffusion with the final objective of reaching consensus.</p><p>As future work the challenge is to leverage the proposed model including trust propagation mechanisms in e-health and e-marketing scenarios, and to test the proposing approach using other type of propagation models in social networks such us the cascading propagation model. In order to do that we plan to take advantage of the labelled Graph rewriting methodologies, as the one presented in</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>S C R I P Tinformation and the consensus degree.</figDesc></figure>
