<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T ELEOPERATION of multiple slave agents has recently emerged to cope with a new set of applications incompatible with single-master-single-slave configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A group of simple and cost-effective agents can now replace a single teleoperator and complete multiple tasks in shorter time, cover large-scaled areas, and adapt more easily to single point failures. Moreover, diversifying the group and scaling down the agents promotes multitasking abilities as well as mobility through diverging paths and/or obstructed spaces where the use of single, larger teleoperated vehicles is restricted. By addressing multiagent environments, teleoperation can effectively encompass a broader range of surveillance tasks, military operations, and rescue missions, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Initially motivated by the field of mobile robots in the late 1980s, research in teleoperation of multiple agents has been primarily focused on coordination control and obstacle avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For instance, work in coordination control includes behavioral-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, optimization-based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and other nature-inspired, such as the nearest neighbor rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>; while research on obstacle avoidance has been addressed through the use of potential field <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and collision avoidance functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Yet, most of these research efforts are framed under unidirectional and/or undelayed control assumptions that generally demand the remote environment to be well known (commonly through the use of continuous visual feedback) and/or physically close to the operator's site. In contrast, bilateral control (also known as peer-to-peer) can offer superior task's performance when visual feedback is unreliable or unavailable by providing the operator with remote contact force and position information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Unfortunately, this gain in performance is typically achieved at the expense of instability issues induced by time delays in the feedback loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>While unidirectional and/or undelayed control systems have been widely studied; time-delayed, bilateral single-master-multi-slave teleoperation systems have received less attention. The ability to remotely coordinate and control multiple mobile agents through a single master robot under constant and time-varying communication channel delays has been attained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Yet, these few research efforts do not address the possibility of an agent-to-agent and/or agent-to-environment collision scene.</p><p>This paper now offers a distributed, bilateral control framework (theoretically and empirically validated) that guarantees coordinated motion between master and multiple slave agents under arbitrary constant communication delays, as well as a safe interaction between slave agents and surrounding environments. We extend the passifying Proportional-Derivative (PD) control in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, originally proposed for single-master-single-slave teleoperation, to enforce motion coordination of multiple slave vehicles and complement it with avoidance functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to guarantee collision-free trajectories. We also extended the bilateral haptic control framework of unmanned aerial vehicles described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> using real-time position and orientation tracking provided by a motion capture system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Experimental results with two coaxial helicopters and a haptic force-feedback device validate the proposed control scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES</head><p>This paper addresses the task of remotely controlling a formation of -degree-of-freedom (DOF) slave agents coupled bilaterally through constant time delayed communication channels to a single -DOF master robot. The master and slave agents have nonlinear Lagrangian dynamics given by . . . . . .</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>1</label></formula><p>where <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>are the generalized coordinates, are the positive-definite inertia matrices, are the centrifugal and Coriolis matrices, are the human and environmental forces, are the coordination-based control inputs, and are the collision-free control inputs for the master (i.e.,</p><p>) and the slave agents (i.e., ). In addition, the above nonlinear dynamic representation satisfies the well known passivity property (i.e., are skew-symmetric matrices) and assumes that the gravitational effects are compensated by active control.</p><p>For the multi-agent teleoperation system (1), we identify three main control objectives. First, the system must be safe and stable, meaning that no damage should be inflicted to the operator, vehicles, and environment. Second, a coordinated motion between master and slave agents should be achieved: the slave vehicles must maintain a desired, relative distance and orientation from the formation's geometric center at all time while moving as a group along the trajectory commanded by the master robot. Without loss of generality, we consider formations with continuous constant (piecewise constant in the case of dynamic formations) functions satisfying and</p><p>Finally, a transparent interaction between operator and environment should be enforced, meaning that the net contribution of environmental forces should be reflected to the operator under steady-state conditions, i.e., . In the following analysis, we assume that each slave agent can locate itself and nearby obstacles inside a detection region. In addition, we suppose that each slave vehicle can communicate its position and velocity to the master robot, and vice versa, through constant delayed communication channels.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Coordination Control</head><p>In general, we would like the system in (1) to be closed-loop stable while enforcing formation control, master-to-slaves position convergence, and static force reflection. By formation control we explicitly mean that the slave vehicles should maintain a relative position and orientation with respect to the formation's geometric center at all time, i.e., . Similarly, by master-to-slaves position tracking we mean that the geometric center of the formation should converge to the position commanded by the master robot, i.e., . According to this formulation, we propose the use of the following PD-based control law for the master and slave agents (3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where are the positive constant time delays on the communication channel from the master to the th slave agent and vice versa, respectively, are positive definite matrices to be designed, and are dissipative gain matrices. We claim that the control law in (3) and (4) achieves stability, motion coordination, and force reflection for the system in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In order to prove our claim, we will first introduce the following result from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 1: Stability of Single-Master-Single-Slave Teleoperators : Consider the teleoperation system in (1) with control law (3) and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) for , and . 1) Robust Passivity: The closed-loop teleoperation system in (1) satisfies the energetic passivity condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (5)</p><p>and the controller passivity condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (6)</p><p>for some and regardless of parametric uncertainties.</p><p>2) Coupled Stability: If there exist finite constants such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> then, (i.e., if the energy generated by the human operator and the remote environment are bounded, then the velocities of the configurations are also bounded).</p><p>3) Position Coordination: Define the coordination error as .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 2: Stability of Single-Master-Multi-Slave Teleoperators</head><p>: Consider the teleoperation system in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">8</ref>) with control law (3) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) for , and static formation.</p><p>1) Robust Passivity: The closed-loop teleoperation system in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">8</ref>) is passive, i.e., satisfies the energetic passivity condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and the controller passivity condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> for some , regardless of parametric uncertainties. Proof: 1) Robust Passivity: Consider the passivity condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Applying directly Theorem 1 we have Similarly with <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, we can easily verify that for some</p><p>. Therefore, we conclude that the closedloop system in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">8</ref>) is passive.</p><p>2) Coupled Stability: Consider the positive function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Taking its derivative with respect to time and applying the skewsymmetric property for Lagrangian systems we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> Then, integrating <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and using the passivity conditions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> give us <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Now, since is bounded by , from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> we conclude that must be bounded as well. 3) Position Coordination: Suppose and . Assume also that . Then, ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) are direct consequences of Theorem 1. Since all terms in (13) are bounded by Theorem 1, must also be bounded, which implies that are also bounded. Similarly, all terms in (14) converge to zero, therefore, . Now we are left to prove that for . From (8) we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> Since are bounded. By the assumption that are bounded, are also bounded <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and since are positive-definite bounded matrices, exist and are also bounded. Therefore, from ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) we conclude that . Now, taking the time derivative of ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) we obtain that all terms at the right-hand side are bounded:</p><p>(by boundedness on ), and</p><p>(by boundedness on <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>). Hence, are also bounded which implies that are uniformly continuous. Applying then Barbalat's Lemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we have that as . Consider once again the system in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> </p><p>for . Now, using (2) and re-writing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> we finally obtain which completes the proof.</p><p>Up to now, we have established closed-loop stability, motion tracking, formation control, and force reflection for the teleoperation system in (8) without addressing the possibility of collisions between slave vehicles and surrounding obstacles. This task will be discussed in the following subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Collision Avoidance Control</head><p>The overall goal in the teleoperation of multiple mobile robots is to achieve motion tracking and formation control of the slave vehicles while enforcing minimum, safe separation distance between any two vehicles or obstacles at all time such that collisions are guaranteed never to occur. In general, we would like to define a safety region around each vehicle for which no other vehicle or obstacle is allowed to enter. According to this formulation, we proceed to introduce the following definitions. We consider the motion of the th slave vehicle from the group formation in (1) and define as the set of obstacles (including other agents) in its vicinity. We assume that the th slave agent can locate nearby obstacles and other agents inside a detection region (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) given as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> where are the coordinates of the th obstacle in and is the detection radius. We also define an avoidance region for the th slave as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> where is the smallest safe distance from any other agent or obstacle and . Then the overall detection and avoidance regions for the system are and , respectively, and the control goal is to design the collision-free control inputs such that the slave vehicles do not enter at any time.</p><p>In order to achieve our control objective, we propose the use of avoidance functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> and the collision avoidance control input <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, shown at the bottom of the page.</p><p>As the next theorem will show, the above control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, together with (3) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), guarantees closed-loop stability, motion coordination, and collision avoidance of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 3: Stability and Collision Avoidance for Single-Master-Multi-Slave Teleoperators: Consider the system in (8) with control law (3), <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> and let</p><p>, where is the number of obstacles and are their coordinates. Suppose that . Then, the closed-loop teleoperation system is stable and . Proof: Suppose that and consider the following Lyapunov-like function Taking its derivative with respect to time and noting that ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) are symmetric with respect to their arguments, i.e., we obtain the equation shown at the bottom of the page. Then, integrating we have Now, assume . This means that for some . However, is bounded by , which means that we reach a contradiction. Since the solutions of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">8</ref>) are continuous, must never enter . Furthermore, from the definition and boundedness on are also bounded, and from continuity of solutions and the fact that must be bounded. Therefore, we can consider the control inputs as external bounded forces and stability of the system and boundedness on the coordination errors follow from Theorem 2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">if if if if<label>(25)</label></formula><p>Remark 3: Note that the collision avoidance control is active (i.e.,</p><p>) only when for some . Thus, outside of the detection region all general conclusions from Theorem 2 apply. This lead us to prefer formations that satisfy such that the collision avoidance control inputs do not represent a persistent conflict with the coordination goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP</head><p>The control framework introduced in Section III was tested in a single-master-multi-slave environment (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The testbed consists of a haptic device (PHANTOM) with three actuated DOF to operate as the master robot, a pair of coaxial helicopters as slave mobile agents, a virtual interface, a Motion Capture (MoCap) system to gather position information from the slave vehicles, and a distributed network of computers for communication and local control. The helicopters were constrained to fly in a 5 m long, 4 m wide, and 1.7 m tall volume to which the operator had direct audio-visual access.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Haptic Device (Master Robot)</head><p>The haptic device, used as the master robot and illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, is the commercial available PHANTOM by SensAble Technologies, Inc. with 6-DOF of positional and rotational input and 6-DOF of force and torque output. Position and velocity commands to/from the slave agents are relative to the base of the PHANTOM's end-effector and are properly scaled to match with the mobility range of the haptic device. Rotational movements around the base of the end-effector are ignored, leaving the Cartesian coordinates, , and , as the only controllable DOF.</p><p>For the experiments, we used an update rate at the haptic interface of 1000 Hz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Aerial Vehicles (Slave Robots)</head><p>The slave agents, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, are two modified E-Flite Blade CX2 coaxial helicopters with multiple spherical retro-reflective markers for identification/localization purpose and cover removed to lower weight. The net weight is 220 g and the rotor diameter measures 340 mm. The CX2 helicopters have four controllable DOF: pitch , roll , vertical thrust , and yaw , which are mapped to the Cartesian coordinates, , and , through a nonlinear map , i.e.,</p><p>A pictorial representation of the rotational angles and the Cartesian coordinates is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(a)</ref>. The dynamics of the coaxial helicopter ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">26</ref>) is, in general, fairly complicated to describe <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Fortunately, the CX2 has the center of lift vertically above its center of mass, which means that the helicopter acts locally (near hover) as a stable pendulum <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. By taking advantage of this feature we can perform a linear stable approximation of (26) by considering hovering as the equilibrium point, i.e., <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref> where is a linear map. This linear map has the property that, when is regulated at a constant zero value, becomes decoupled: small changes in , and proportionally translate into , and motion, respectively. Then, we can easily apply the control law in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. The main drawback of this approach is that we constraint motion of the helicopter to low speeds and accelerations such that the approximation in (27) remains valid.</p><p>Assuming the linear model in ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>), the control parameters and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and the nominal control inputs for equilibrium of the helicopters, also known as trim values, were empirically found. The collision avoidance function for both helicopters was a sphere, such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, with an avoidance and detection radii of 400 and 900 mm, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Virtual Coupling</head><p>The slave controllers run on two separate off-board computers limited to a sampling rate of approximately 40 Hz due to wireless transmission's hardware constraints. That means that position and velocity data are communicated to the haptic device every 25 ms. However, a much higher update rate (e.g., 1000 Hz) on the haptic system is desirable in order to provide the operator with stable and realistic force feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>A solution to overcome the constrain on the sampling rate and allow the haptic's control to perform at a faster pace is to mediate the coupling between the haptic device and the helicopters via a virtual helicopter, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(b</ref>). The virtual helicopter is modeled as a frictionless 3-DOF second order linear system with negligible mass in order to reduce the increase in inertia perceived by the operator. It is coupled to the master robot through a simple PD control <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and to the slave agents through the control law in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where the virtual helicopter is interpreted as the master robot. The dynamic model for the virtual agent is then given by where and are the mass and the Cartesian coordinates of the virtual agent, respectively. The matrices are symmetric positive-definite and computed such that the digital connection between the haptic and the virtual environment is passive <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Therefore, since the coupling between virtual agent and slave vehicles is passive (by Theorems 2 and 3) and the fact that the serial connection of two passive system is also passive, we can conclude that the passivity of the overall system is preserved. Furthermore, the reader can easily verify that, for quasi-steady-state conditions and negligible mass , position coordination, as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, is achieved. Similarly, since the collision avoidance control inputs are independent of the master's dynamics, a safe interaction between agents and surrounding environment is also guaranteed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. MoCap System</head><p>Position tracking of the helicopters is performed off-board, meaning that the helicopters lack of self-contained position and velocity sensors. Instead, the testbed employs a MoCap system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> that consists of multiple high speed cameras located in the remote environment and capable of tracking position and orientation of the slave agents in real-time by collecting two-dimensional visual data and constructing a three-dimensional representation through a photogrammetry-based technique. The cameras are able to sense and track unique configuration patterns of retro-reflective markers placed on the tracked vehicle or obstacle with a sub-millimeter accuracy at a sampling rate of 120 Hz. Position and orientation information from all vehicles and obstacles are then transmitted to each helicopter's control computer with low latency (less than 10 ms) such that every vehicle knows its own location and the location of nearby static and dynamic obstacles. Velocities of the vehicles are then computed locally by differentiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Communication</head><p>Communication between agents and haptic device is achieved through TCP socket connections. Each agent transmits its Cartesian coordinates and velocities to the virtual environment and receives from the virtual environment the coordinates and velocities of the virtual helicopter and the corresponding offset for the desired formation . Control inputs are computed locally.</p><p>The total average round trip delays for agents one and two were found to be 93 ms and 124 ms, respectively, with a standard deviation of 1 ms which means that fluctuations on the delays were negligible.

The red and blue markers correspond to the first and second helicopter, respectively. The dashed-line, larger circles represent the detection regions while the solid-line circles represent the avoidance regions. Initial positions (q (t )) are indicated by the darker, solid circles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>Three different experiments were performed. The first of these experiments was the teleoperation of both helicopters in a free (i.e., unobstructed) environment. The desired formation was a diagonal line with mm mm mm . Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate, respectively, the resulting motion in the plane <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> and the Euclidean norm of the position error for the formation, where are given by</p><p>The two helicopters (red and blue markers), starting at opposite positions with respect to the desired formation, converged to the diagonal formation and followed thereafter the motion of the virtual helicopter (black line) without entering into each other's avoidance region. The commanded path by the virtual helicopter was a round trip from the right-back (i.e., negative ) to the left-front (i.e., positive ) corners of the workspace. As plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, the agents converged to the desired formation in a short time (i.e., s) and maintained the formation fairly well through the complete trajectory ( mm s). Additionally, the vehicles were reported to track the master command with relative small error ( mm s). The second experiment consisted on teleoperating both agents through an obstructed environment. Two tall rectangular obstacles, modeled as three-dimensional cylindrical objects for collision avoidance's purpose, were placed near the center of the workspace. The helicopters were commanded to fly to the front of the room and then to return near the original position in the same fixed formation as in the first experiment. As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, the helicopters were able to navigate safely around the obstacles tracking the virtual vehicle motion in the required diagonal formation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> illustrates the coordination and formation errors where it can be observed that the formation error is in general higher (i.e., mm for all s) than in the previous experiment, in particular at where the agents come to the proximity of the static obstacles and the left virtual wall ( mm). Nevertheless, the coordination error for the center of the formation remained small ( mm s). In the last experiment, the helicopters were commanded to fly from the back side of the workspace to the front side in a nearly parallel formation to the axis with mm mm mm . In addition, the operator had the ability to switch to a horizontal line formation mm mm mm whenever he/she considered it preferable. Two rectangular obstacles were placed at mm mm and mm mm such that the most feasible path for the agents was to travel between both obstacles. As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, the slave agents initially converged to the desired formation but encountered resistance to follow the virtual master's trajectory due to the presence of static obstacles. Once the operator switched to an horizontal line formation ( s), the helicopters were able to complete the path without collisions.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> illustrates the coordination and formation errors for the last experiment. The peak values at s, and s correspond to the events at which the slave agents are unable to follow the master trajectory due to the detection of the static obstacles and to the change of formation from to and vice versa, respectively. Position errors in the above experiments can be attributed to uncertainties on the trim values, nonlinearities in the helicopters' dynamics, and the frequent interaction between the helicopters, the virtual walls, and the static obstacles, among other disturbances. Despite this, the above experiments demonstrate the adeptness of the proposed control framework to enforce position convergence, formation control, and collision avoidance for a multi-agent system under constant time delays and obstructed environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we presented a distributed, bilateral control framework that enforces position tracking, formation control, force reflection, and collision-free trajectories for a single-master-multi-slave teleoperation system with constant communication time delays. The former three properties are achieved through the use of a passifying PD-based control, while the later is guaranteed via the integration of avoidance functions. The control framework was then validated through experiments with two coaxial helicopters coupled to a haptic device and teleoperated in an obstructed environment.</p><p>Future research directions include motion coordination and stability analysis for time-varying delay communication channels, delayed avoidance functions, and dynamic formations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2 ) 3 )</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Coupled Stability: If there exist finite constants for Position Coordination: Define the coordination errors as for .
