<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A central element of the design philosophy that shaped the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> is the end-to-end argument <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, summarized as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>: ``An end-to-end protocol design should not rely on the maintenance of state (i.e., information about the state of the end-toend communication) inside the network. Such state should be maintained only in the endpoints, in such a way that the state can only be destroyed when the endpoint itself breaks.'' Intelligence and control is end-to-end rather than hidden in the network. The resulting interconnection of communication links is sometimes termed a dumb network, to emphasise a contrast with the earlier telephony infrastructure where a smart network connects endpoints (telephones) that have little responsibility for control. A dumb network allows new applications to be designed, prototyped and deployed without requiring changes to the underlying network, and has resulted in an extraordinary flowering of innovation. It also places a considerable responsibility for cooperative behaviour on endpoints.</p><p>A key illustration of the end-to-end argument is TCP, the transmission control protocol of the Internet, and its congestion avoidance algorithm, due to Jacobson <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. The rate at which packets enter the network is controlled by TCP, implemented as software on the computers (the endpoints) that are the source and destination of the data. The general approach is as follows. When a link within the network becomes overloaded, one or more packets are lost; loss of a packet is taken as an indication of congestion, the destination informs the source, and the source slows down. The TCP then gradually increases its sending rate until it again receives an indication of congestion. This cycle of increase and decrease serves to discover and utilize available bandwidth, and to share it between flows.</p><p>Jacobson's algorithm has been outstandingly successful, as the Internet has evolved from a small-scale research network to today's interconnection of tens of millions of endpoints and links. This in itself is a striking observation. Each of a large but indeterminate number of flows is controlled by a feedback loop which can know only of its own experience of congestion and of its own feedback delay. A flow does not know how many other flows are sharing a link on its path, or even how many links are on its path. The links vary in capacity by many orders of magnitude, as do the propagation delays that are a consequence of geographical diversity and the finite speed of light. That end-to-end congestion control can have achieved so much, in such a rapidly growing and heterogeneous network, is remarkable.</p><p>However, there are several interrelated developments that pose a challenge. Buffering at queues within the Internet has been important since the early days of store-and-forward communication networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, to smooth statistical fluctuations and, it is commonly believed, to help stabilize the network. But the huge capacity of tomorrow's links, together with the desire to carry delay-sensitive traffic, may cause an evolution towards a network with much smaller queueing delays. Is end-to-end congestion control feasible in such a network, and, if so, how should TCP evolve?</p><p>This paper explores possible answers to this question, and outlines some of the important insights that have been obtained from simplified mathematical models of congestion control. The selection of material has been primarily influenced by recent experiments with new, incrementably deployable, TCPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, the related modelling advances <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, and by proposals for variants where more explicit information is returned to end-points <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>The organization of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we describe a tractable mathematical model of a network, following the development in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. An optimization framework leads naturally to two classes of rate control algorithm: primal algorithms, which broadly correspond with end-to-end congestion control mechanisms where noisy feedback from the network is averaged at endpoints; and dual algorithms, which broadly correspond with averaging at resources prior to the feedback of more explicit information to endpoints. Both types of algorithm reach an equilibrium which is proportionally fair. Fairness is a central issue in networks where responsibility for cooperation is devolved to endpoints, and various definitions of fairness have been suggested as the basis for behavioural norms. Weighted proportional fairness is a criterion with appealing properties from either an optimization, a game-theoretic or an economic viewpoint.</p><p>In Section 3, we outline how TCP's congestion avoidance algorithm can be interpreted within the optimization framework, and discuss the round-trip time bias of TCP. Through a simple example we describe the potentially distorting effect of this bias on network structure. It has not proved easy to remove round-trip time bias: variations to TCP's algorithm designed to shift the equilibrium point can easily have the unintended side-effect of destabilizing the equilibrium.</p><p>The stability of the equilibrium point may be compromised by two interacting effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>: delay instability, due to the combination of high gains and time delays; and stochastic instability, due to inherent randomness. In Section 4, we describe the important recent work of Vinnicombe <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> on delay instability, and on a potentially stable and scalable variant of TCP. In Section 5, we discuss stochastic instability, including Ott's scale-invariance property <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Delay instability is characterized in terms of TCP's increase rule, while stochastic instability is primarily influenced by the decrease rule. We use this separation to interpret a proposed TCP variant <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> that aims to remove round-trip time bias while simultaneously controlling both forms of instability.</p><p>In Section 6, we discuss dual algorithms, starting with the delay-based scheme of Paganini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. This section describes a variety of other dual algorithms, including a family of fair dual algorithms with attractive stability properties. Fair dual algorithms have promise in circumstances where more explicit feedback is available and either: a link can estimate the average round-trip time of packets passing through it, as in the proposal of Katabi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>; or propagation delays are not large, as in home networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> or ad hoc networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Section 7 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Fairness</head><p>How should available bandwidth be shared between competing users of a network? In this Section, we describe a mathematical framework for rate control which allows us to reconcile potentially conflicting notions of fairness and efficiency.</p><p>Consider a network with a set J of resources. Let a route r be a non-empty subset of J, and write j P r to indicate that route r passes through resource j. Let R be the set of possible routes. Set A jr 1 if j P r, so that resource j lies on route r, and set A jr 0 otherwise. This defines a 0 À 1 incidence matrix A (A jr , j P J, r P R).</p><p>Consider the system of differential equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d dt x r t r w r À x r t j P r j t 2 3</formula><p>, 1</p><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">j t p j sXj P s x s t<label>2 3</label></formula><p>: 2</p><p>(Here and throughout we assume that, unless otherwise speci®ed, r ranges over the set R and j ranges over the set J.) Assume that w r , r &gt; 0, and that the function p j (y), y ! 0, is a non-negative, continuous, strictly increasing function of y.</p><p>We may motivate the relations (1)±(2) as follows. Suppose that resource j marks a proportion p j (y) of packets with a feedback signal when the total flow through resource j is y, and that each feedback signal is viewed as a congestion indication requiring some reduction in the flow x r . Then equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) corresponds to a rate control algorithm for the flow on route r that comprises two components: a steady increase at rate proportional to w r , and a steady decrease at rate proportional to the stream of congestion indication signals received. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we shall call the system (1)±(2) the primal algorithm.</p><p>Define the dual algorithm d dt j t j rXj P r x r t À q j j t 2 3</p><p>, 3 where x r t w r kPr k t , 4 j &gt; 0, and q j p À1 j is a strictly increasing function. Again, the algorithm has a straightforward interpretation. If we view p j (y) as a load-dependent price at resource j, then q j () is the ¯ow through resource j which generates a price at resource j of . Thus, an economist would describe the right-hand side of equation (3) as the vector of excess demand at prices ( j (t), j P J ), and would recognise Eqs. (3)±(4) as a tatonnement process <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> by which prices adjust according to supply and demand.</p><p>Both the primal algorithm (1)±( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and the dual algorithm (3)±( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) have a unique stable point (x, ), which is the same for both algorithms, and to which all trajectories of either algorithm converge. At the stable point</p><p>x r w r jPr j</p><p>: 5</p><p>This equation has a simple interpretation in terms of a charge per unit ¯ow: the variable j is the shadow price per unit of ¯ow through resource j. The allocation x (x r , r P R) given by Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) has an interpretation in terms of a weighted proportional fairness criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, satisfying certain natural assumptions from cooperative game theory as to what constitutes fairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. The weight w r is the aggregate shadow price of the ¯ow x r , and the vector of weights (w r , r P R) is proportional to the share of scarce resources obtained by different ¯ows. Suppose that route r is associated with a user, representing a higher level entity served by the flow on route r. Suppose if a rate x r &gt; 0 is allocated to the flow on route r then this has utility U r (x r ) to the user. Assume that the utility U r (x r ) is an increasing, strictly concave function of x r over the range x r &gt; 0. To simplify the statement of results, we shall assume further that U r (x r ) is continuously differentiable, with U H r x r 3 I as x r 5 0 and U H r x r 3 0 as x r 4 I. Let C j ( y) be defined by C j y y 0 p j z dz:</p><p>From our assumptions on p j (y), the function C j (y) is strictly convex. We might view C j ( y) as a form of cost incurred at resource j, that increases more rapidly as the resource becomes more heavily loaded.</p><p>Next suppose that user r is able to monitor its rate x r (t) continuously, and to vary smoothly the parameter w r (t) so as to satisfy w r t x r tU H r x r t X 6</p><p>this would correspond to a user who observes a charge per unit ¯ow of r w r (t)/x r (t), and chooses w r w r (t) This in turn corresponds to price-taking behaviour on the part of user r, who does not anticipate the impact of its own choice of w r (t) on the system. If w r is replaced in (1) and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) by the time-varying form (6) then both the resulting algorithms have a unique stable point, which is the same for both algorithms, and to which all trajectories of either algorithm converge <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The stable point is proportionally fair, i.e., it is of the form (5), with w r w r (I). The stable point maximizes the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x r P R U r x r À j P J C j sXj P s x s 2 3 :<label>7</label></formula><p>Thus, if each user is able to choose its own weight, w r (t), and does this so as to optimize its own utility less payment, then either algorithm will converge to the rate allocation x maximizing the net utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The parameter w r (t) may be viewed as the willingness to pay of user r. Alternatively, in a network of cooperative users, w r (t) may be viewed as a time-varying weight chosen by user r with resource, but no monetary, implications. The distinction will not be important in this paper. Define the demand function D r r U H r À1 r , a continuous, strictly decreasing function. Then, at the stable point, x r D r jPr j . Mo and Walrand <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> have introduced a class of utility functions U r x r w r x 1À r 1 À ( w r log x r if 1) with derived demand functions D r r w r r</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1= :<label>8</label></formula><p>Term the resulting allocations x r D r jPr j ; r P R weighted -fair: if w r 1, r P R, the cases 3 0, 1 and 3 I correspond respectively to an allocation which achieves maximum throughput, is proportionally fair or is max±min fair, and we shall refer to a weighted version of the 2 case in the next Section on TCP. The interpretation of the weights (w r , r P R) as proportional to the share of scarce resources obtained by different ¯ows is lost if T 1.</p><p>An attractive case of the dual algorithm, considered by Low and Lapsley <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, sets q j C j I &gt; 0, where the scalar C j is the capacity of link j. Although this choice of q j (.) violates our simplifying assumption that q j (.) is strictly increasing, there is again an identi-®cation of equilibrium points with maxima of the function <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, where now C j (y) 0 if y C j , and C j (y) I otherwise. The identi®cation ®xes the vector x uniquely, but now the equilibrium vector may not be unique. A suf®cient condition for uniqueness of is that the incidence matrix A have full row rank.</p><p>None of the above results depend upon the gains r , r P R, j , j P J, which could indeed have been fairly general positive functions of the state (x(t), (t)). The choice of gains is, of course, constrained by stability conditions, the subject of Sections 4, 5 and 6. The primal algorithm (1)±( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) is a simple but crude caricature of an end-to-end congestion control mechanism. In the next section, we refine the caricature, and study the fairness of TCP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Modelling TCP</head><p>Packets transferred by TCP across the Internet are acknowledged. If a packet is lost then the destination detects this; the detection of loss prompts the resending of the lost packet, and is interpreted as an indication of congestion. Using lost packets to signal congestion has obvious drawbacks. First, it is wasteful, since a dropped packet may have already consumed resources at earlier stages of its route and needs to be resent. Second, there are limits upon the quality that can be provided by a network if damage to packets (e.g., loss or delay) is an essential part of the network's control mechanism. These considerations have led naturally to proposals for the introduction of congestion marking, whereby a packet that encounters incipient congestion has a bit set in its header. The procedure is called Explicit Congestion Notification, or ECN <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Endpoints detecting ECN marks should respond by reducing their transmission rates. The result will be a system that can share resources without recourse to dropped packets, except in periods of exceptionally heavy use. ECN has now been made a ``Proposed Standard'' by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the body concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In this paper, our models will make little distinction between whether a dropped or a marked packet is used to indicate congestion: in either case a packet crossing the Internet generates a single bit of information concerning congestion along its route.</p><p>Jacobson's algorithm [15] is self-clocking: the sender uses the acknowledgement from the receiver to prompt a step forward. The source maintains a window of sent</p><p>but not yet acknowledged packets; the rate x and the window size cwnd satisfy the approximate relation cwnd xT. We shall outline a general class of increase and decrease rules (first considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>) for the window ± Jacobson's algorithm will be a special case. We suppose the congestion window is incremented by a cwnd n for each positive acknowledgement, and decremented by b cwnd m for each congestion indication, wheren n &lt; m.</p><p>The expected change in the congestion window cwnd per update step is approximately</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">axT n 1 À p À bxT m p</formula><p>where p is the probability of congestion indication at the update step. Since the time between update steps is about T/cwnd 1/x, the expected change in the rate x per unit time is approximately</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x T axT n 1 À p À bxT m p:</formula><p>Motivated by this calculation, we model the algorithm by the system of differential equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">d dt x r t x r t T r Â a r x r tT r n 1 À r t À b r x r tT r m r t ,<label>9</label></formula><p>where r t 1 À j P r 1 À j t, 10 j (t) is again given by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), and T r is the round-trip time for the connection of user r. We again view p j (y) as the probability a packet collects a congestion indication signal at resource j when the total load through resource j is y. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) models the situation where congestion indication is provided by a dropped packet or a single bit, and corresponds to an approximation that packet drops or marks at different resources are independent.</p><p>The system (2), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) has a unique equilibrium point, to which all trajectories converge (appendix I). The equilibrium point has the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x r 1 T r a r b r Á 1 À r r 1= ,<label>11</label></formula><p>where m À n. The case a 1, b 1 2 , m 1, n À1 corresponds to Jacobson's TCP; the case a r M r , b r 1/(2M r ), m 1, n À1 corresponds to Crowcroft and Oechslin's MulTCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, where M r is a parameter in¯uencing the share of resources achieved by ¯ow r. In either case, 2: thus Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">11</ref>) recovers the inverse square root dependence on the probability of packet loss familiar from the literature on TCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. And if r is small enough that r % jPr j , then the equilibrium is approximately weighted -fair, with weight w r a r =b r T 2 r . The weights, and the form ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">11</ref>), exhibit round-trip time bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>: for a given packet loss probability, r , the ¯ow on route r is inversely proportional to the round-trip time T r . Several variants of TCP have been proposed to correct this bias against ¯ows with larger values of T r , some of which we will discuss later in Section 5.</p><p>A less than obvious consequence of round-trip time bias is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Suppose that a cache is to be placed at one of two locations. One location is connected to a large body of potential users via two short congested links, on each of which the packet loss probability is p &lt; 1 2 and the round-trip time is T S . The other location is connected via a short congested link and a long uncongested link, over which there is no packet loss and the round-trip time is T L . The flow rate achieved to a user from the two locations will be proportional to</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">1 2T S 1 À p 2 1 À 1 À p 2 2 3 1=2 , 1 T S T L 1 À p p 1=2</formula><p>respectively, from relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. It follows that better TCP throughput will be received from the nearer cache if T L &gt; 2 3 p À 1T S , even though this cache makes twice the use of scarce resources. 1 Decisions on cache location, capacity expansion, the topology of overlay networks, are often based on such local, decentralized optimizations. Thus, we should expect the round-trip time bias to have consequences for the In this simple example, a halving of distance can compensate for as much as a quadrupling of packet loss probability. The discussion assumes that TCP's performance is primarily determined by its congestion avoidance phase, rather than its initial slow start phase. There are clearly advantages in using nearby caches for the transfer of short files. ef®ciency of the evolving network structure, as well as for the short-term fairness of the rates achieved by competing ¯ows. In particular, round-trip time bias will encourage underuse and underdevelopment of long links, and overuse and overdevelopment of short links, relative to an ef®cient network structure.</p><p>Next suppose that 1, and that r is small enough that r % jPr j . Then Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">11</ref>) becomes approximately the proportionally fair allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, with weight w r a r /(b r T r ). Might it be possible to design a variant of TCP with these features, so that the parameters a r , b r could compensate for the round-trip time bias, or more generally provide a straightforward control over the share of resources achieved by a flow? We return to this question, after looking at the influence of the increase and decrease rules upon stability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Delay Stability</head><p>In the last Section, we have seen how the self-clocking feature of the algorithm can cause the round-trip time of a flow to have an important effect on the share of resources allocated to the flow. Next, we consider how the differential equations of the last Section should be amended to model delayed feedback, following Vinnicombe <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p></div>

In the current Internet, the total round-trip time is composed of not just propagation delays, but also queueing delays at resources and delays at endpoints. But these additional delays may not be fundamental to the end-toend model: higher capacities reduce queueing delays, and ECN marking and faster processors will further reduce delays at endpoints. An aim of this paper is to explore the end-to-end model when T r is reduced to the inescapable minimum, the propagation delay.

It may not be unique: for the following discussion we ®x on one solution and assume that it may be perturbed continuously, the generic case.</p><p>The first point to note is that T r as well as r acts to limit the equilibrium flow x r , through Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">11</ref>). Thus, Q j ( j ) as well as j acts to limit the load on resource j, allowing generally lower packet loss probabilities at equilibrium than if queueing delays were negligible.</p><p>The second point concerns dynamic properties when n À1, corresponding to current TCP. Suppose that capacities and buffers are such that queueing delays can be substantial: further, as a crude model of the current Internet, suppose that a resource either is not fully utilized, in which case the packet loss and queueing delay are near zero, or is fully utilized, in which case the packet loss is variable but the queueing delay is near constant, at the time taken for a packet to pass through a near full buffer. Then the round-trip time on a route will depend upon which resources along the route are fully utilized, but not sensitively upon the packet loss probabilities at these resources. The analysis leading to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">18</ref>) will apply approximately: hence the presence of a full buffer at a resource will, by increasing the congestion windows of all flows through that resource, help stabilize the equilibrium point.</p><p>In summary, within the current Internet, we should expect queueing delays at resources not only to allow lower loss probabilities at an equilibrium, but also to help stabilize an equilibrium. Conversely, if queueing delays within the Internet are to be reduced, then algorithms will be needed, such as the n 0 variants of the last subsection, that maintain stability without the help of queueing delays.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Discussion</head><p>The constraints imposed by delay stability take different forms for primal and dual algorithms: for primal algorithms there are restrictions, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, on resource behaviour; while for dual algorithms there are restrictions, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, on demand functions. Delay-based dual algorithms are effective at fully utilizing resources, but are less effective at fairly sharing resources when delays are heterogeneous. In contrast primal algorithms can achieve fairness, but are less effective at utilizing resources fully. Kunniyur and Srikant <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> have shown that by slowly adapting the marking function p j (y) at resources, primal algorithms can also control resource utilization; and Paganini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> have shown that by slowly adapting the demand function D r () at sources, delay-based dual algorithms can also control fairness. For a discussion of the resulting primal-dual schemes, which aim to achieve both fairness and high utilization, see Low and Srikant <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Without propagation delays, global stability can be obtained for primal-dual schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. With heterogeneous delays and averaging at both sources and resources, Vinnicombe <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> has established an important robust stability result, briefly mentioned in Appendix II.</p><p>For the primal algorithm Johari and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> observe that the form p j (y) (y/C j ) , for integral, is the probability that a packet arriving at an M/M/1 queue will find or more packets already present; more generally, the restriction (19) may be plausible in connection with queueing phenomena. For the fair dual algorithm, the restriction upon demand functions, that D r r À r D H r r , corresponds precisely with the definition of weighted -fairness, and hence this algorithm's ability to achieve fairness and full utilization.</p><p>In a network comprising a single resource that knows the number of flows through it, much more can be done: see Hollot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for an analysis of several schemes, including some which correspond to classical proportional and proportional-integral control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have reviewed recent work on the fairness and stability of end-to-end congestion control. We have described models that provide some insight into the success of the congestion avoidance algorithm of TCP, and into how it might, or should, evolve in the future. In particular, we have seen that it is in principle possible for an arbitrary collection of overlapping flows to share resources in a fair, stable and scalable manner, using end-to-end mechanisms where each flow knows only of its own experience of congestion and of its own feedback delay.</p><p>The heterogeneity of the Internet makes it important to understand what can be achieved with minimal, incrementably deployable, changes. We have seen that in networks with long propagation delays, a single bit of congestion information per packet may be ample: delay stability requires relatively slow adaptation at endpoints, slow enough to allow averaging of congestion information over many packets. For home or ad hoc networks different issues arise. Homogeneity of equipment may allow substantial changes in protocols, and when round-trip times are short more explicit feedback can substantially reduce variances.</p><p>We have not discussed work on the initial phase of TCP, i.e., Jacobson's slow-start algorithm [15], or work on the dynamics of flow arrivals and departures, both areas which give complementary insights into network behaviour. And it is salutary to note that in the Linux source, less than 1% of the TCP code concerns congestion window updates. These are important lines, governing the way the network shares resources in a fair and stable manner; but they are not all there is to TCP.</p><p>At the stable point a r x r T r 1 À r b r x r T r r : 46</p><p>Proof. The assumptions on a r (w), b r (w), r P R, and on p j , j P J, ensure that (x), given by expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, is strictly concave on the positive orthant with an interior maximum; the maximizing value of x is thus unique.

The strict concavity of (x) and the continuity of the derivative <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref> implies that the derivative (50) is bounded away from zero outside any open neighbourhood of x, and the result follows. &amp;</p><p>The choices a r w a r w n , b r w b r w m r P R with m À n &gt; 0 correspond to Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix II: Local Stability Under Time Delays</head><p>Consider the linear system T r d dt u r t À r u r t À r x r r t 51 for r P R, where r t j P J A jr j s P R A js u s t À T sj À T jr : 52</p><p>Theorem 9.1. Suppose that r , r , x r ! 0 for r P R; j ! 0 for j P J; A jr , T jr , T rj ! 0 for j P J, r P R, and the identity (12) is satis®ed.

First, the condition (53) is local, in the sense that it involves k j only for resources j for which A jr &gt; 0 and, for these resources, it involves x s only for routes s for which A js &gt; 0. Secondly, the delays T jr , T sj are not part of the condition: the term T r in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">51</ref>) is suf®cient to scale the gain on route r.</p><p>That a result of the above form might be possible was first conjectured by Johari and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. They showed that the identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> leads to an elegant decomposition of the transfer function into a product of a diagonal and an Hermitian matrix, and used this to establish their conjecture in the case where all roundtrip times are the same. The clear formulation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> of the essential problem stimulated considerable interest, and three independent papers reported exciting further results <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. MassoulieÂ <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> established the above result in the case where 0 and the right-hand side of condition (53) has /2 replaced by 1; an alternative form of the same result was proved by Paganini, Doyle and Low <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, who established condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, with /2 replaced by 1, as a sufficient condition for local stability of the dual algorithm (29)± <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Vinnicombe's lemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, a key bound on the eigenvalues of the product of a matrix and a diagonal matrix, allows the result as stated to be proved <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 9.1 is really a family of sufficient conditions for stability. Given the vector ( r x r , r P R), different choices for the vectors ( r , r P R), (x r , r P R) will leave the system (51)±(52) unaltered, but will give different conditions (53). Thus the system (32) is an example of Eqs (51)±(52) with the choice r 0, r x r ÀD H r r T r . The stability condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> corresponds to the choice r ÀD H r r T r =x r , while the stability condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> has k r 1=M r , x s ÀD H s s M s T s . Similarly the system (39) is an example of Eqs. (51)±(52) but with j replaced by j j . The stability condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> corresponds to the choice r ÀD H r r T r =x r , while the stability condition (41) has r ÀD H r r =x r . To obtain condition (18) consider the system d dt</p><p>x r t x r t À T r T r Á À a r x r tT r 1 À r t À b r x r tT r r t Á , 54 together with Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">14</ref>) and (15). Let x r (t) x r u r (t), r (t) r (1 À r ) r (t), and write y j sXj P s x s , p j p j y j , p H j p H j y j . Let n r wa H r w a r w m r wb H r w b r w , both evaluated at w x r T r , at which argument we assume a r (Á), b r (Á) are differentiable. Then linearizing the systems ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">14</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and (54) about its unique equilibrium point (x, ), and using relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, we obtain the equation T r d dt u r t À a r x r T r 1 À r Â m r À n r u r t x r r r t together with Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Then a suf®cient condition for stability is that m r &gt; n r and a r x r T r 1 À r r jPr y j p H j 1 À p j &lt; 2 , as can be seen by setting r a r (x r T r )(1 À r )/ r and j p H j =1 À p j in Theorem 9.1.</p><p>In the model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">14</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and (54) the Eq.

Vinnicombe has also considered a variant where the marking probability at a resource is a function of an exponentially weighted average of the flow through the resource. Consider the system ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">14</ref>), (54) where, instead of Eq. (15), j t p j z j t, j d dt z j t sXjPs x s t À T sj À z j t:</p><p>In Vinnicombe <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> it is shown that the linearization of this system about its equilibrium point is locally stable if j P r A a r x r T r Á y j p H j p j &lt; 1; 55 if, further, j P r A j &lt; 2T r 56 then the stability is robust to perturbations of the link and source dynamics. Now if j P r then the propagation delay through link j is a lower bound on T r : condition (56) will thus be satis®ed if the ¯ow averaging at link j has a time constant j less than twice the propagation delay through link j. Vinnicombe's results <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> provide a family of suf®cient conditions: for a given guarantee of robust stability, the coef®cient of T r appearing in the right hand side of the inequality in (56) may be increased, at the cost of a reduction of the right hand side of the inequality in (55).</p><p>back delays and Gaussian noise. The stationary solution would again be Gaussian, and the results of this and the previous appendix would presumably emerge as boundary cases. Similarly, we have assumed that the primary source of randomness in primal algorithms is the averaging process at endpoints, while the primary source of randomness in dual algorithms is the averaging process at resources. It would be interesting to study the interaction of both averaging processes, and to explore whether our variance analyses emerge as boundary cases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fairness</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
