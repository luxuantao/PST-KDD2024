<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>EXTROUS manipulation means handling objects D skillfully and adroitly, and it involves operating manipulators with actively powered fingers. We would like to think of a robot as a machine that can be instructed to perform at least any task that a human can, at least as well as a human. However, the current state of robotics research is far from this goal. At this point, although reasonably accurate mechanical manipulators exist, we do not know how to use them effectively, and therefore they are useful only in simple application domains, such as welding and spray painting.</p><p>A dextrous hand is one with multiple articulated fingers (i.e., fingers with two or more powered joints), each of which is an open kinematic chain, and possibly a palmar surface. It contains a large number of degrees of freedom and can achieve fine resolution with high accuracy and at high speeds. Each of the fingers should contain position and force sensors and may additionally contain tactile sensors.</p><p>The first question to be answered is, "Why use dextrous hands instead of just conventional grippers?" Hands have</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">IEEE Log Number 8927240.</formula><p>that a parallel gripper cannot. Furthermore, unlike simply a set of robot arms working cooperatively, a hand may have a palm. there may be coupling between the fingers as there is in the human hand, and since there is only one arm, manipulation is not as complex.</p><p>The science of manipulation, which is only a subfield of robotics, is a broad field in itself, comprising many topics such as gripper design, grasping, control, tactile sensing, and task planning. The main problem is determining how to use the fingers of the hand not only to obtain an effective grasp of an object (which may be of unknown shape and orientation), but also to manipulate the object to perform a given task. In a broad sense, the problems involved include [21]   control issues: processing and utilization of force/ torque and spatial informations necessary in geometric, positional, and force feedbacks while correcting for errors which may occur; geometric issues: adapting to bodies of known and unknown shape, especially in the absence of sophisticated sensory data; integralion issues: managing information about the force, torque, mobility, and compliance available in the system, such as a priori knowledge and information obtained from sensors; task planning issues: devising appropriate trajectories.</p><p>To deal intelligently with each of these issues, the nature of the contact wrenches, twists (mobilities), and compliance of the fingers must be well-understood in each of the subtasks of dexterious manipulation. Basically, there are four subproblems: grasping, homogeneous manipulation, high-level task planning, and design of hands and tools for manipulation. The grasping issues are as follows.</p><p>Static issues: How do the contact types restrict the nature of the force? What restrictions are caused by the contact surface, i.e.. what effects do unreachable areas of the object have on the grasp? How are the available degrees of freedom dealt with? How does the grasp depend on the geometry of the hand and the object? Existence of a grip; This depends on the properties of the object and the characteristics of the hand.</p><p>0018-9472/89/0700-07S3$01.00 01989 IEEE achievement of the desired finger targets and correction of modeling errors. How can the large number of actuators be managed? What kind of sensory data can be fed back into the servo loops and how would it be used? Control law: A (single) control law should be specified that would cause the gripped object to behave locally in a prescribed way (e.g., remote center of compliance. stiffness control).</p><p>High-level task planning includes developing a sequence of homogeneous manipulations to execute the task while providing the necessary transition procedures (which might not be quasi-static); and the transition of grips. Most tasks require a number of different grips. To perform these tasks, the robot must be able to change from one grip to another, possibly very different, grip. This change must be done in real time without losing control of the object.</p><p>The design of hands and tools for manipulation includes deciding what kind of hands and tools to build. Do we want anthropomorphic hands or a possibly more efficient hand design, i.e., hands designed to execute specific tasks more efficiently? Do we need to redesign tools for these hands?</p><p>This paper does not attempt to deal with all of these problems; rather, it discusses some of the issues involved in static grasping. In attempting to solve these problems, researchers have taken two basic approaches; one is a physiological approach motivated by the study of human hands and the other is motivated by the physical and mechanical properties of hands and objects.</p><p>The human hand is a versatile end effector that can perform intricate tasks. Studying human grasps can lead to a grasp taxonomy that can assist robot hands in choosing an appropriate grasp to perform a specific task and can also be used to design efficient grippers. , Another approach involves studying the physical and mechanical properties of grasps and understanding how the actions of the robot affect the motions of the object. For instance, when a finger touches an object, will it slide away? Will it settle into a secure grasp? Will it settle into a grasp that allows motion relative to the manipulator? How do we model the fingers? What forces are transmitted by these fingers? How compliant are the fingers'? Is there friction?</p><p>It should be noted that these two approaches are not competing. To some extent, they deal with different aspects of the same problem, and therefore they complement each other. Whereas the mechanical approach seems more suitable for low-level tasks (homogeneous manipulations), the physiological approach is likely to be more suitable for high-level tasks.</p><p>This paper is divided into two main parts, the first of which deals with studies on human grasping and grasp taxonomies, while the second part deals with physical and mkchanical issues such as contact types, number of fingers required to achieve grasps, equilibrium, stability, and compliance. The final section summarizes the' results. The mathematical convention used throughout this paper is as follows: scalars appear in lower case italics, vectors are denoted by lower case bold italics and represented by a row-vector, and matrices are in upper case script.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PART I-PHYSIOLOGICAL APPROACH</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">GRASPING TAXONOMIES</head><p>In an effort to simplify the choice of grasp a robot has to make, numerous attempts have been made to categorize grips by studying grasps of the human hand. The human hand is capable of a wide range of grasps, and the grasp selection depends on the size and shape of the object as well as the task to be performed. Studying how these factors influence the grip choice leads to a taxonomy which provides a systematic way to choose an appropriate grasp for a particular set of task requirements and object characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Medical Literature</head><p>Human grasps were first categorized in the medical literature by Schlesinger [20] and are summarized in Taylor and Schwartz [23]. This classification is based on the shape of the object rather than the task to be performed. The six types of grasps are the cylindrid grasp, the tip grasp, the hook grasp, the palmar grasp, the spherical grasp and the lateral grasp (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Napier <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> argues that when one grasps an object for whatevet' purpose, the major concern is the stability of the grasp. He therefore bases his classification on how stability is achieved, which leads to two major types of grips. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Power Grip:</head><p>The object is held in a clamp formed by the partly flexed fingers and the palm, while counter pressure is applied by the thumb, which lies more or less in the plane of the palm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">) Precision Grip:</head><p>The object is pinched between the flexor aspects of the fingers and the opposing thumb.</p><p>He then goes on to discuss the factors that influence the posture of the hand. The first factor is the shape of object, which for many medical researchers, such as Taylor and Schwartz, is the main factor to consider when determining the grip. In contrast to them, Napier claims that in fact the shape of the object has no bearing on the posture adopted by the hand, since most objects may be held in a number of grips with equal security, and that the grip depends solely upon the purpose to which the object is to be put.</p><p>The next factor discussed is the size of the object. For medium size objects, both grips will provide stability. For larger sizes, however, the grip chosen is the one which provides the greatest span of the hand without compromising stability; this is most likely a power grip. This factor has no general applications. Additional factors that may sometimes influence the type of grip employed are weight, texture, temperature, and wetness of object.</p><p>The most important influence is the intended activity. During the performance of a purposive prehensile action, the posture of the hand bears a constant relationship to the nature of that activity. If prehensile activities are to be regarded as the application of a system of forces in a given direction, then the nature of the prehensile activity can be resolved into two concepts: precision and power. (The two, however, are not mutually exclusive; for some tasks, both may be required.) Finally, the pattern of the chosen grip is based upon the nature of the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Grasping in a Manufacturing Environment</head><p>Cutkosky and Wright (31 approached the problem to design efficient robot grippers for a manufacturing environment. They carried out a series of protocol analysis experiments with machinists and classified these and other machining grips. These have led to the taxonomy of hu-They extended Napier's basic categories by considering the man grasps, which they orgsinized as a hierarchical tree.</p><p>task and geometric considerations that influence the pattern of the grip (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Moving from left to right along the tree, the grasps become less powerful yet more dextrous and the grasped objects become smaller. The wrap grips are the most powerful yet least dextrous and therefore require that all manipulation must be done with the wrist. By contrast, the precision grips are much more delicate. Moving from top to bottom, the choices range from task-directed grasps to object-directed grasps. As with any hierarchical classifications, there are some exceptions to these rules.</p><p>Often, a grip must be continuously modified to retain maximum efficiency in relation to the objective sought in the grip. In these cases, the influence of forces and torques on the choice of grip is most apparent. For example, in unscrewing a knob, the grip changes from grip 11 to grip 13. When similar tasks are performed with slightly different tools, other factors come into play. For example, the grip may shift from 1 to 5 for a lighter tool, or from 13 to 14 for a very small object.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Virtual Fingers</head><p>lberall's <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> classification is based on the fact that, in practice. the human hand uses a combination of grasps.</p><p>Most of the other taxonomies fail due to their inability to explain all the exceptions that occur as a result of task constraints. A classification is required, which describes a prehensile posture in goal-directed terms. It should be able to describe task constraints and hand postures in terms of the number of directions and strength of the forces to be applied. To select a grasp, specific characteristics must be identified with each domain of interaction. Once the grasp has been chosen, the object characteristics are used to particularize the grasp components for the object. The same grasp may use different physical fingers depending on the object characteristics. For example, the same grasp is used to grasp mugs of different size even though a different number of fingers may be used. Therefore, the grasp is defined in terms of virtual fingers (VF's) and is later mapped onto the physical fingers. The concept of virtual fingers provides independence from physical hand structure and particular object models.</p><p>According to Iberall, the hand can employ three basic methods to apply opposing forces around an object for a given task, each of which use two VF's (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>Pad opposition is between the thumb pad (VF1) and the finger pads (VF2). This grip provides great flexibility in finely controlled motions, but little stability.</p><p>Palm opposition is between the palm (VFI) and the digits (VF2). It sacrifices flexibility in favor of stability. Side opposition is either between the thumb pad (VFZ) and the side of :he index finger (VF2) or compromise between flexibility and stability. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Side Oppoaition</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lyons [lo],</head><p>[ll] used the concept of virtual fingers to classify grips as part of a computational model he built, since to build a gripping device that can approach the versatility of the human hand, a high-level control structure is needed. He studied the human hand and made some observations. The hand preshapes for the grasp while it reaches for it. While the reach is concerned with the object's position, the grasp is concerned with the object characteristics as well as the intended object usage.</p><p>He therefore associates with each grasp a preshape finger configuration for that grasp and the degrees of freedom of the hand once the object has been grasped. He classifies grasps into three major categories and calls this classification a simple set of grasps (SSG). As in Iberall's classification, there is a power grasp, a precision grasp, and a grasp providing some power and some precision (Fig. completely envelopes the object. Manipulation can only be accomplished through the arm and wrist and this is used for basic '' pick-and-place'' tasks.</p><p>2) Laterul Grasp: This is basically the pinch grasp. The flat surfaces of the fingers are used to grip the object. It provides some manipulative ability and some stability.</p><p>3) Precision Grasp: The object is held between fingertips. It allows arbitrary motion but provides little stability.</p><p>Each of these grasps must be particularized to suit the size and shape of the target object. Therefore, Lyons derives a table relating functionalities and object characteristics to a given grasp; he calls this the grasp index. The functional input to grasp selection is the firmness of the grasp required and precision of the grasp required. This results in four categories: no precision and no firmness, no precision and firmness, precision and no firmness, precision and firmness. Two object characteristics are considered: size, which can be small, long, or large, and shape, which is either flat or round. Thus the grasp index tells how required functionality and object characteristics are used to find a suitable stereotype grasp.</p><p>Lyons divides grasping into the following three phases. I) Preshape: This is where the hand is configured in preparation to grip the object while it is reaching for the object.</p><p>2) Acquisition or Gripping: As the fingers move to contact the object, they have low stiffness, and once the contacts are in place, the contact forces required to secure the object are calculated. There are three cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a) Simple acquisition:</head><p>The hand moves toward the object in the preshape configuration and grasps it. b) Two-phase ucquisilion: The object is acquired in a temporary grasp and is then manipulated to the final configuration. c) Constrained acquisition: It is impossible for the hand to approach the object with the chosen grasp and preshape. Therefore, either the grasp or preshape must be modified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Manipulation:</head><p>A table is used to determine how to move the object based on the degrees of freedom left in the hand. This ranges from moving only the wrist to the hand being able to impart arbitrary forces and moments to the object.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Comparison of Taxonomies</head><p>Although many different classifications exist, the underlying theme of precision versus stability, as introduced by Napier, influences all the taxonomies. This shows the importance of precise and stable handling in performing dextrous tasks.</p><p>Cutkosky and Wright present a good and thorough classification for a machine environment. The hierarchical representation is neat and clear. However, there are overlaps and exceptions. One example they mention is that a spherical grasp may be more or less dextrous than a medium wrap, depending on the size of the sphere. Since in a restricted machine environment, the characteristics of the objects to be manipulated is known a priori, this does not present a problem. However, if we wish to expand this taxonomy to other domains which are more complex and less constrained, a tree representation may not be accurate, yet nevertheless it is probably the best and clearest a p proach.</p><p>Lyons, like Cutkosky and Wright, bases his classification on precision versus stability. Rather than expanding into a tree, for each of his primary grips he considers different characteristics, from which results a table (the grasp index). However, his grasp index is simple and limited. It considers only coarse descriptions of characteristics in some unknown restricted environment. An attempt to enlarge this table for a general environment would probably render the table unwieldy and overly complex.</p><p>Iberall attempted to simplify the taxonomy by showing that every grip is really two virtual fingers acting along some pad of opposition. She mapped the grips from the other taxonomies into her own. She criticized the previous taxonomies for not explaining exceptions due to task constraints. While her criticisms are valid, her new taxonomy does not address these issues adequately. Furthermore, more than any of the other classifications, her taxonomy is more dependent on the characteristics of the human hand and may not be very useful for many nonanthropomorphic grippers. It is not apparent how this taxonomy would help to simplify the grasp choice for a robot task; presumably she uses a table like Lyons.</p><p>All of these taxonomies function only in limited domains. Cutkosky and Wright did their study in a manufacturing environment. Lyons attempted to be more general, but when he was forced to particularize the grasp, he could only handle a limited number of cases in his grasp index.</p><p>At this point we must ask oursleves. Are we going to use these taxonomies to design grippers or to assist in selecting a grasp? What kind of environment are we dealing with? Is there another way to quantify these grasps, perhaps mathematically? We can study how humans perform tasks in particular domains or see if there are better ways to perform grasps, and design hands to perform those domain specific tasks efficiently, or we can use these taxonomies and try to understand better how to particularize a grasp to perform a specific task and how to achieve these precise and stable grasps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PART 11-MECHANICAL AND PHYSICAL APPROACH</head><p>While much research has been done in categorizing grasps to assist in grasp selection, another approach to grasp selection has been to study the physical and mechanical properties of the hand, the object, and the contacr between them. Quite a number of different grasps arc discussed in the literature. Although most people might not think before grasping certain objects, there are many factors that influence the choice of a grip. Researchers have considered different factors such as contact types, friction, compliance, and stability, as well as the intended This part discusses some of these issues. Section I11 discusses different contact models and Section IV discusses different grasps in physical terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">CONTACTS</head><p>Before we can study how to find a grip and determine its properties, we must first consider the interaction between the fingertips and the object being grasped. It is therefore important to study the mechanics of constraint and freedom that take effect when two bodies come into contact. The contact causes forces and moments to be transmitted to the objects, and consequently, the relative motion between the two bodies is determined by the geometric and frictional properties of the contact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Contact Types Based on Screw Theory</head><p>Salisbury's [14] analysis is based on screw theory which uses six parameters, so there are six degrees of freedom (relative motion), and hence six classes of contacts (excluding the trivial case of no contact). A surface can experience three types of contact: point contact, line contact, and plane contact. By studying how the motion of a body is constrained by the various types of contact and considering the effect of friction, he derives the contact types shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. The constraints imposed by each type of contact are described in terms of the degrees of freedom allowed and in terms of screw systems of motion and force associated with each contact type. This formulation is neat and makes the calculations simple; however, it is not always accurate for certain kinds of contact. For instance, it does not take into account surface deformation under load, which, in addition to friction and surface geometry, also affects the strength and stability of a grip.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contact Types Based on Fingertip Geometry</head><p>Cutkosky I21 defines a different set of models. Rather than studying just contacts between rigid bodies, he c6nsiders different types of fingertips and defines a set of models that may be used to characterize the fingertip geometry: point contacts, hard curved contacts, flat contacts, soft curved contacts, and very soft contacts (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p><p>Cutkosky compared the different kinds of fingertips. He analyzed the forces and torques they exert, as well as the effects of friction and the sizes of the radii of curvature of the fingertips. He found that the rolling of curved fingers causes the contact area to shift with respect to the object.</p><p>As the radius of curvature of a curved finger approaches zero, the contact behaves like a point contact with friction, and as the radius of curvature becomes very large, the contact approaches a planar contact with friction.</p><p>Since fingers deform, Cutkosky studied deformation of fingers and how it affects contacts. The fingertip compliance is considered in addition to the finger joint compliance. For a small contact area, the fingertip becomes more compliant with respect to rotations and approaches the point contact model. For larger contact areas, the translational compliance is larger, and the contact approaches a planar contact with friction.</p><p>Human fingertips exhibit rolling and deformation. The model of the human fingertip is soft and curved, and does combine the attributes of the soft and the curved fingertips.</p><p>Cutkosky then studied the major differences between the contact types. He found that for a pointed fingertip, the problem was two-dimensional when only rotations were considered. For curved fingertips, the grasps proved to be more stable on account of the rolling of the fingertips. He also discovered that there is an important relationship between the radii of curvature of the fingertips and the object being grasped. The quantification of the size of the radius of curvature of the fingertip depends on the size of the object, so that for large objects, it is reasonable to consider the point contact model.</p><p>Salisbury provides a simple classification of contact types, while Cutkosky does a more in-depth study of contacts and attempts more realistic models of contacts. However, we shall see in the coming sections that most analyses consider the point contact with friction, since it is simplest to deal with mathematically, although quite a few consider the soft finger model that models a human finger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Iv. GRASPING: TERMINOLOGY AND THEORY</head><p>In an effort to bring several issues in this area into sharp focus, we shall make the following simplifying assumptions. Consider an idealized robot hand, consisting of several independently movable force-sensing fingers; this hand is used to grasp a rigid object B. Furthermore, Smoofk Body: B is a full-bodied (i.e., no internal holes) compact subset of the Euclidean 3-space. Fur-consider the fol1ow;ng.</p><p>Repmdud with permission of cowright owner. Further reproduction prohibited.</p><p>thermore, B has a piecewise smooth boundary dB. We remark that all the discussion here applies to the case where B is in the Euclidean 2-space as well, but we will forego explicit treatment of this case, for simplicity. Point Coniacf: For each finger-contact on the body, we may associate a nominal point of contact, p E d E .</p><p>We let dB* denote the set of points p E d B such that the direction n ( p ) normal to a B at p is welldefined; by convention, we pick n( p ) to be the unit normal pointing into the interior of B.</p><p>For each such point p, we can define a wrench where the number and screw-axes of the wrench system depend on the contact type. Some of these wrenches can be bisense (i.e., can act in either sense) and the remaining wrenches, unisense. In a similar manner, we can also associate a twist system with each nominal point of contact. (For a discussion of screw theory, and in particular, wrenches and twists, see <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> and [19].) Compliance: We will consider two cases. When the fingers are stiff-the force/torques applied at the fingers are generated by some actuators whose mechanics need not concern us, and when the fingers are compliant-the contacts are modeled as a set of independent linear or angular springs, and the force/torques are derived from the potential energy (a scalar quantity). Thus in the second case the wrenches are monogenic, while in the first case the wrenches may be polygenic.</p><p>Many interesting special cases occur, depending on how we model the static friction and the stiction between the fingers and the body B. In the case where the contacts are frictionless, a finger can only apply force f on the body in the direction n ( p ) at the point p. Also, if the fingers are nonsticky, then the force f has a nonnegative magnitude, ff . n ( p ) &gt; , O . Such grips are also known as "positive grips." The wrench system associated with each point is We first consider the case in which the finger forces are not necessarily monogenic.

Also, as the external wrench is varied in the course of a manipulation task, this algorithm updates the force targets fast.</p><p>Yet another formulation of a closure grasp is via form closure. Recall that with each nominal point of contact we can also associate a twist system; they describe the degrees of freedom of the body local to that contact point. Thus a system with a set of contacts is free to move by a twist if and only if the virtual coefficient of any wrench and the twist is nonnegative, since otherwise the virtual work done by some wrench would be negative. This occurs when the twist is reciprocal to the bisense wrenches and reciprocal or repelling to the unisense wrenches. A set of twists (associated with the contacts) is said to constitute a form closure if and only if any arbitrary twist is resisted by the set of contacts. That is, the object is totally constrained with no degree of freedom left. Thus if d is an arbitrary twist then it must be nonreciprocal to some wi ( i =l,---, k)</p><p>or must be contrary to some 9 ( j = k +1;. a , n). Put another way, this is equivalent to saying that, for any arbitrary vector d' E R 6, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W T + Wf T, wi-d'= 0, wj-d' -A wj.d' &lt; 0,</formula><p>for all 1 g i 6 k implies that for some k + 1 i &lt; n, which, in turn is equivalent to the condition that Thus force/torque closure and form closure are quivalent; this idea seems to have been accepted by the r e searchers in the area. We also emphasize that this formulation has turned a problem in mechanics into a purely geometric problem, now amenable to many interesting techniques in convexity theory and computational and combinatorial geometry. This observation has bken most fruitfully exploited in [15].</p><p>Next we consider the case when the forces are monogenic. In this case we can associate a potential energy with each finger, and the potential energy of the object grasped by a set of fingers is simply the sum of the individual finger potential energies and the potential energy of the object. Thus the potential energy Vof a grasp G is 0 E int conv ( v wk+ * e , n w,,).</p></div>

The second summand is the potential energy of the object at the particular configuration, given by the coordinate of the center of gravity of the object in fixed space do, and the orientation of the object represented as angles between the coordinate axes and a fixed axis in the object 8,; this may be assumed to be caused by some conservative field such as gravitational field.</p><p>For example, if we assume that each finger force is caused by the compliance of the finger (modeled as a linear spring), then the ith finger force is proportional to the i th finger compression ai:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f k = k l ~l</formula><p>where ki is the ith spring constant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Number of Fingers Required fo Achieve a Grasp</head><p>To obtain a particular grasp on an object, it must be determined if that grasp is achievable. For this reason, researchers have studied the question of how many fingers (wrenches) are required to obtain certain grasps on the object.</p><p>Reuleaux and Somoff determined that the form closure of a two-dimensional object requires at least four wrenches and of a three-dimensional object requires at least seven, where the wrenches are normal to the surface of the object. Mishra et al. 1151 gave the most general bounds on the number of fingers in the case of a positive grip; they also provided algorithms that find at least one such grip and run in time linear in the complexity of the object. Let d be the dimension of the object, and m,, be the degrees of freedom of a free object in d-dimensional space. (This is three in two dimension and six in three dimension.) In summary, their results show that the object can be held at equilibrium by a positive grip of m d + l fingers (four fingers in two dimensions and seven fingers in three dimensions). If the object has no surfaces of revolution, then the object can be held with a closure grasp by a positive grip of 2md fingers (six fingers in two dimensions and 12 fingers in three dimensions), and any external wrench acting on the object can be balanced by a positive grip of md fingers. For the frictional case, their results can be generalized to show that the object can be held at equilibrium with d + 1 fingers (three in two dimension and four in three dimension) and can be held with a closure gap also using d -t 1 fingers. Markenscoff et al. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> proved that when there is no friction, for an object with a piecewise smooth boundary, four fingers are required to achieve form closure of a planar object, while 12 fingers are required for a threedimensional object (but under certain conditions, only seven fingers are required). In all cases, however, form closure is not achievable if the object has a rotational symmetry. Under relaxed assumptions, when Coulomb friction is taken into account, three fingers are required in two dimensions and four fingers are required in three dimensions. Although the proof techniques used here are quite different from those used by [15], the results are similar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Grip Transform</head><p>Salisbury [14] identifies the external and internal forces acting on the object in a grip matrix used to determine how to apply forces and control the motion and stiffness of the object. He shows that, when a grasp rorally consfrains an object, there are contact and frictional forces it can apply to the object while maintaining its equilibrium, and he then shows how to identify these forces. In the course of performing a task with a grasped object, the object will be subjected to external forces. To measure these forces, as well as the internal forces acting on the body, Salisbury defies the grip transform 9 which, like the Jacobian #, is used to map forces between finger joints and grasped object coordinates. Q is a square matrix whose dimension and rank are the number of contact wrenches acting on the object, and so it is constant for a particular grasp on an object.</p><p>As before, let W = [ w:, %T, *'* e , w:] be a 6 x n matrix of linear rank 6; each w; is the screw coordinates of the principal wrench of the ith .contact wrench system. Then the net 'wrench w, applied to the object is given by wT= WfT, where f is a vector of contact wrench intensities.</p><p>The grip transform W T can now be constructed by augmenting the 6 X n matrix W with the n -6, n-element (orthonormal, linear) basis vector of the homogeneous solution</p></div>

Their analysis is quite geometric, since the interpretation of gripping forces depends on the locus of feasible points of concurrence of the gripping forces.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Stability</head><p>Hanafusa and Asada [SI introduced the concept of stable prehension, similar to the one discussed earlier. They did their analysis in two dimensions using a robot hand with elastic fingers and rollers on the fingertips to eliminate friction. There are three coordinate systems used in the computation: xo is the coordinate of the hand center, xg is the coordinate of the sectional center of the object, and x, are the finger positions for i =1,2,3.</p><p>The two conditions for the desirable hand position are as follows. case, he considered objects that were planar polygons multiple point contacts without friction, and the fingers were modeled as virtual springs with controllable stiffness.</p><p>In three dimensions (181, the contacts are modeled as frictionless point contacts, hard-finger contacts, or soft- finger contacts with friction. The fingers are virtual springs, and each virtual spring is a set of independent linear and angular springs. These correspond to the wrenches defied by Salisbury.</p><p>As a grasped object is displaced by an infinitesimal twist grasp, the ability of the grasp to resist slipping, and the ability of the p a s t to return to equilibrium in the event of disturbances.</p><p>The fingers are^ elastic and the object is rigid. Motions are considered to be small, so that the transformations can bc linearized, and only motions with respect to the hand are considered. Tl)e analysis is static, and while it does not try to find the qptimum grip for a given task, it does provide a mechadkm for evaluating certain properties of the grip. There a$ three main criteria used in choosing an appropriate grip: Stiffness: G r e p stiffness depends on the stiffness of the fingers and tdeir arrangement about the object. A stiff grip would be usehul in manipulating objects at high speeds. The best grip is the one which best matches the achievable finger stiffnesses to the task requirements.</p><p>Stability: Si&amp;e this analysis is concerned with small motions, the stadiity criterion considers whether a grip is infinitesimally steble, i.e., whether the grip will return to its original positibn if the object is displaced by an arbitrarily small amount.</p><p>Resistance id slipping: The grip should be able to resist the greatest possible applied force or torque before any of the finger slip.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">I</head><p>To carry out the computational steps, one needs to express the interaction &amp;tween grasping forces and small motions of the object. p u s it is necessary to determine how the forces applied by the fingers affect the grasp force and how small m o t h s of the object influence the resulting motions of the fingers. Cutkosky shows that the effective stiffness of the object being grasped is a function of the servo parametqs, fingertip models, and small changes in the grasp geomdtry as the object is perturbed by external forces.</p><p>As others, Cdtkosky models the grasped object and the set of fingers vith the points of contact as independent rigid objects. "$e configuration spaces for the fingers (in terms of the joint variables), the contacts, and the objects are expressed in separate coordinate systems. Note that the configuration space of the object is a six-dimensional Euclidean space, whereas the configuration spaces of the contacts and the fingers are determined, respectively, by the wrench systems associated with the contacts and by independent finger joints. The relation between the contact forces and the external force on the object is determined by the grasp transforms, and the relation between the joint forces and the contact force is determined by each finger Jacobian. By the principle of virtual work, similar relations exist between the instantaneous kinematics (i.e., velocities or infinitesimal displacements) of the joints, contact points, and the objects. Similarly, assuming that the fingers do not slip relative to the object when the object moves infinitesimally, an equivalent stiffness expression can be given, relating the external force on the object to the displacements of the object. During the computation of steps 2 and 3, however, we need to compute both forward and inverse transforms, and since all these systems are not exactly determined, some care must be given to the inverse transforms. In particular, we need to consider the following three cases.</p><p>The motion of the object exactly determines the motion of the finger. For this case, the Jacobian can be inverted to obtain the inverse displacement and force relations.</p><p>The motion of the finger is underdetermined. The remaining undetermined elements may be computed by adding constraints such as those requiring that the potential energy be minimized. The motion of the finger is overdetermined. The motion of the finger is limited. However, it is also possible that, for some motions, there may be undetermined elements that can be solved for, as in case 2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHYSICAL APPROACH</head><p>Much of the research has provided useful tools that may bring us closer to useful hands. Salisbury and Cutkosky studied contact models and how they affect the freedom of the object. Mishra, Sharir, and Schwartz as well as Markenscoff, Ni, and Papadimitriou calculated how many fingers are needed to obtain grasps on certain objects. Salisbury introduced the notion of the grip transform. He used it to describe neatly the forces present in a grip and what forces can be applied to the grip without disturbing the equilibrium. Hanafusa and Asada introduced the notion of stability, but only determined stable grasps for a very simplified model. The analysis works for the case of no friction but has limited usefulness since friction is an important consideration. Nguyen addressed the stiffness of objects grasped by virtual springs. He added the stiffness consideration to Hanafusa and Asada's work, and also extended it to three dimensions. However, in trying to generalize the calculations, they became too complex so he only dealt with limited simplified cases. Cutkosky obtained problems have been lished. In studying other measures fori grasps in addition to stability. He showed how to me ure the stability, stiffness, and resistance to slippage, hich are other important considera-For humans, grasbing an object seems like a simple task, yet analyzing the de ails involved shows us that grasping is very complex and ere are many issues to be considered. The primary focus dntil now has been establishing statistically stable grips, aslwas done by Hanafusa and Asada and also Nguyen, altholbgh researchers are now dealing with finding grasps suitable to the performance of tasks.</p><p>What emerges frob all this is the importance of finding a stable grasp. A hot of work has been put into this problem, but most d the researchers seem to come up with the same mathemat cal calculations (much of which were omitted in the desc t -ptions). The main idea seemed to be to obtain a stable giasp by identifying force relationships, programming the stjffness of the fingers, and reducing the degrees of freedom pf the object. Jacobians were obtained and calculations weie done using standard linear algebra. However, all these balculations included constraints that were added to obtaih results, yet it remains unclear how to determine some of these constraints and why they were chosen.</p><p>The most unsatisfactory situation in the whole area concerns the probleh of synthesizing a grasp. While the physiological appro ch has succeeded in a limited way to address these issues, little or no progress has been made by researchers using a 1 alytical techniques. The work of <ref type="bibr">[U]</ref> does provide an alg rithm to synthesize a positive grip, but and no effort has b+ made to come up with a grip that satisfies additional ixiteria of "goodness." Techniques to synthesize grasps anb to integrate these grasps into homogeneous manipulatibns must be developed, and this is where ideas from bdth approaches can be used together.</p><p>tions for choosing a T grasp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>this is only workedlout 0 in the case of an idealized hand, identified and tools have been estabthe physiological aspects of grasping, certain properties of grips, such as the potential energy, stability, and compliance, and the establishment of the relationships between forces and movements of the hand and the object.</p><p>The physiological and mechanical approaches are complementary. The physical and mechanical results are needed to understand the low-level elements involved in grasping. This includes contact types, effects of friction, compliance, slipping, and what is involved in obtaining a stable grasp. However, for higher-level elements such as task planning, studying how human hands grasp objects and perform tasks is more useful.</p><p>For the purpose of performing a task, it might not be sufficient to have a stable grasp. Often, there are many different possible stable grasps, and so we will have to choose which one, if any, is appropriate for the task to be performed. There has been little success in evaluating the suitability of a grasp to perform a particular task in terms of its mechanical properties, and therefore, these grasp taxonomies (and expert systems) can better assist the dextrous hand in choosing a grasp.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

This occurs when the center of compliance of the object is at the common intersection of the lines of action of the springs and when the center of compliance is such that the weighted sum of the virtual springs is zero. He shows for this second case how to ensure that the stiffness matrix will be positive definite by choosing the center of compliance of the object.</p><p>Extending this to three dimensions, the stiffness matrix X is the Hessian matrix 31p of Y at the equilibrium configuration.</p><p>where Xs depends on the spatial vectors of the I linear springs and the n -I angular springs and X, depends on the angular stiffness matrix</p><p>where i , is a spatial vector representing the configuration of a linear spring (if 1 Q i Q I) or an angular spring (if The sign depends on whether or not friction is present ( + denotes no friction and that the fingertips slide on the surface of the object,denotes presence of friction and that the fingers stick to the point of contact). XP8 corresponds to the position of the angular stiffness matrix and is equal to <ref type="figure">(E!=,</ref><ref type="figure">f,</ref><ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">(p,</ref><ref type="figure">)</ref>)Z, where Lo corresponds to the contact force due to the i th linear spring.

He assumes that the stiffness of each finger is known. The motions and force changes resulting from displacement of the object are computed and are then used to determine the overall stiffness of the</p></div>			</div>
