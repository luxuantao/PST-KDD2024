<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract-Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are inevitably corrupted by mixture noise during their acquisition process, in which various kinds of noise, e.g., Gaussian noise, impulse noise, dead lines, and stripes, may exist concurrently. In this paper, mixture noise removal is well illustrated by the task of recovering the low-rank and sparse components of a given matrix, which is constructed by stacking vectorized HSI patches from all the bands at the same position. Instead of applying a traditional nuclear norm, a nonconvex low-rank regularizer, i.e., weighted Schatten p-norm (WSN), is introduced to not only give better approximation to the original low-rank assumption but also to consider the importance of different rank components. The resulted nonconvex low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) model falls into the applicable scope of an augmented Lagrangian method, and its WSN minimization subproblem can be efficiently solved by generalized iterated shrinkage algorithm. Moreover, the proposed model is integrated into an iterative regularization schema to produce final results, leading to a completed HSI restoration framework. Extensive experimental testing on simulated and real data shows, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that the proposed method has achieved highly competent objective performance compared with several state-of-the-art HSI restoration methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>H YPERSPECTRAL imaging (HSI) has been attracting great research interests in the field of remote sensing in recent years because of its wide range of applications in geography, agriculture, and military <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Unfortunately, during the capturing procedure, due to various factors, including sensor saturation, photon effects, quantization errors, transmission errors, and calibration errors, the HSI is usually impaired by several types of noise, e.g., Gaussian noise, impulse noise, dead lines, and stripes, rendering the images unsuitable for further applications, such as HSI unmixing, image classification, and object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Therefore, HSI denoising has become an essential preprocessing step for improving the performance of subsequent applications.</p><p>Many different denoising methods have been proposed for hyperspectral imagery until now. Inspired by prospective results achieved by gray-level image denoising methods, such as nonlocal mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, K-SVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, BM3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, LSSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, NCSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and SAIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, the HSI data can be denoised straightforwardly using those methods band by band. However, denoising in this way is always not satisfying since the correlation among all the spectral bands has been ignored. To take account of the correlation, tensor algebra is introduced into HSI denoising by treating HSI as a hypercube. As two important tensor decompositions TUCKER3 and PARAFAC play significant roles in analyzing tensors, researchers have proposed several representative tensor based HSI denoising methods, which combine multidimensional Wiener filter with either TUCKER3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> or PARAFAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Beyond merely using correlation among bands, many researchers are more inclined to jointly consider the spatial and spectral information to remove noise efficiently. For instance, Othman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposed a spatial-spectral wavelet shrinkage method working in the spectral derivative domain for HSI denoising. It took advantage of the dissimilarity of the signal regularity from both spatial and spectral dimensions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT) is utilized to sparsify the image along the spatial dimension as well as 1-D DCT to sparsify the image across the spectral domain. To remove the impulse noise, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, both spatial redundancy and spectral correlation are captured to formulate denoising as an l 1 -norm regularized l 1 -norm data fidelity minimization problem. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, an HSI denoising method is designed by utilizing a spectral-spatial adaptive total variation model, where the noise differences in spectral domain and structural information in spatial domain were both considered. By observing that noise distributions in spatial and spectral views were different, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, a strategy of fusing denoised results from both views is employed to further improve the performance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Zhong and Wang retorted to capture the dependence across spatial and spectral neighbors by using a multiple-spectral-band conditional random field model under a unified probabilistic framework. Moreover, other advanced techniques, including the nonlocal similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, principal component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, anisotropic diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, multiresolution wavelet analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, sparse and lowrank penalties <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, matrix decomposition/factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and multitask sparse matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, have been adopted for designing different HSI denoising methods. Nevertheless, all the methods mentioned earlier are designed to handle at most two kinds of noise, i.e., Gaussian noise, impulse noise, or hybrid Gaussian-impulse noise.</p><p>In real-world applications, HSI data usually corrupted by a combination of various kinds of noise, such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, dead lines, and stripes. Hence, there is a need to simultaneously remove all these types of noise. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of the low-rank technique for mixture noise removal. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the low-rank property of the image matrix was explored by rearranging 3-D patch cube in the same position through all the bands as a 2-D matrix. The bilateral-random-projection-based algorithm, namely "Go Decomposition" (GoDec) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, was used to explicitly enforce rank r and cardinality k constraints for low-rank and sparse components, respectively. However, this model cannot capture the intrinsic low-rank part of the HSI data, and the optimal values of the rank r and cardinality k are difficult to determine. By sharing the similar idea, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is used to solve the low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) problem with an additional noise-adjusted iteration strategy. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the rank r also needed to be predefined. Different from the patchwise LRMA model mentioned earlier, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, a lowrank property is acquired through the pixel vectors in spectral domain (e.g., stacking all band values in the same position into a vector). By gathering similar pixel vectors in a local neighborhood into a matrix, the low-rank priori can be explored. Although reasonably effective, it was only designed for hybrid Gaussian-Laplacian noise, which resulted in undesired performance for certain outliers such as dead lines and stripes.</p><p>In this paper, we present an iterative HSI restoration method for mixture noise removal based on LRMA, where the lowrank regularization is induced by a nonconvex rank constraint namely weighted Schatten p-norm (WSN). The main ideas and contributions of the proposed method are threefold. First, the low-rank property of HSI data is explored by the robust PCA (RPCA) with explicitly Gaussian noise modeling. Unlike the hard rank and cardinality constraints provided by GoDec, the extended RPCA model can capture intrinsic rank of HSI data, as well as recover the sparse and Gaussian noise component more accurately.</p><p>Second, a new low-rank regularizer WSN is introduced into LRMA. The resulting model, which is referred to as WSN-LRMA, not only takes unequal treatments to different rank components, leading to flexibility in dealing with noise removal but also gives better approximation to the original low-rank assumption, getting better denoising results theoretically and practically. Such a kind of nonconvex LRMA is extremely difficult to solve. Fortunately, based on our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the objective function of WSN-LRMA can be efficiently optimized. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of a regularizer has never been considered in HSI denoising before. Furthermore, we also give a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed WSN-LRMA.</p><p>Third, the proposed method is integrated into an iterative regularization schema, in which the noise level is estimated and updated automatically, leading to a self-adjusted restoration framework for HSI data. Extensive experimental testing shows, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that the proposed method can effectively remove the mixture noise and recover details of the original scene compared with many state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we motivate the proposed WSN-LRMA model in detail and demonstrate its superiority compared with the traditional model. In Section III, we give an optimization algorithm to solve the proposed model, analyze its convergence, and further improve performance by constructing an iterative regularization algorithm. The experimental results are shown in Section IV, and we conclude the proposed method and discuss the future direction in Section V.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Intrinsic Low Rank in HSI</head><p>Suppose that the latent number of clean spectral endmembers in the HSI subcube is r; its corresponding patch matrix A can be formulated as A = MD T , where the columns of A are constructed by converting the patch in each band to a vector and stacking all those vectors together (as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), D ∈ R B×r + is the latent end-member matrix with each column denoting a clean spectral end-member, and M ∈ R wh×r + is the abundance matrix. Since the number of endmembers r is commonly relatively small, i.e., r wh or r B (as shown in the SVD plot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, only a few singular values are greater than zero), as well as the value of r is usually unknown, we refer to this property as the intrinsic low-rank constraint. The remainder of this section will describe how to capture the intrinsic rank more accurately by using the extended RPCA model and the proposed low-rank regularizer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Low-Rank and Sparse Decomposition in HSI Degradation Model</head><p>HSIs, as pointed out in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, can always be degraded through the acquisition process by a mixture of different kinds of noise, which typically consists of Gaussian noise, impulse noise, dead lines, and stripes. As a result, the HSI degradation model can be described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d = a + e + n<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where a denotes the latent HSI, d is the observed corrupted HSI, e represents the mixture of impulse noise, dead lines, and stripes, and the last term n is the Gaussian noise. All the images d, a, e, and n are 3-D cubes with a same size of M × N × B. By adopting the patch-based restoration schema, the HSI can be divided into overlapped subcubes, and the restoration can be done for each subcube sequentially. Concretely, for the subcube centered at the pixel (i, j) with a size of w × h × B, degradation model (1) can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d (i,j) = a (i,j) + e (i,j) + n (i,j) . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>By rearranging all 3-D subcubes into 2-D matrices (as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and omitting the subscript, the degradation model can be transformed into the following matrix form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D = A + E + N<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where matrices D, A, E, and N with a size of wh × B correspond to d, a, e, and n, respectively. To design a lowrank-based HSI restoration method, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the GoDec model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is adopted to capture the "low-rank + sparse" decomposition approximately as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min A,E N F = D-A-E F , s.t. rank(A) ≤ r, card(E) ≤ k</formula><p>(4) where r and k, both of which are required for predefined, denote the upper bound of the rank of A and the cardinality of E, respectively, and • F is the Frobenius norm. However, the values of r and k need to be predefined rather than be intrinsically determined by the content of matrix A, let alone be different for subcubes at different locations. To capture the intrinsic rank, the RPCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is usually applied to construct a LRMA model, which can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">min A,E A * + λ E 1 s.t. D = A + E<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A * + λ E 1 s.t. D = A + E + N, N F ≤ η (6)</formula><p>where η &gt; 0 denotes the Gaussian noise level. It is worth noting that both (5) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) are different since the Gaussian matrix N is explicitly constructed. Similar formulation can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, in which it is stated that this model can unify the classical PCA and the RPCA by considering both sparse errors and entrywise noise in the measurement. Moreover, modeling noise matrix N in an explicit way is more suitable for embedding into the proposed iterative regularization schema since the Gaussian noise variance would be explicitly estimated and updated during the iteration of the restoration process. Indeed, as shown in Section III-B, the value of η decreases in iterative regularization, which will help estimate low-rank component A more accurately. This is the motivation of introducing the iterative regularization schema. Furthermore, nuclear norm minimization (NNM) tends to overshrink the rank components, as well as treats different rank components equally <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, which will be discussed in detail in the following. Therefore, a more flexible low-rank regularizer, namely the WSN, which is proposed in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, is adopted to replace the traditional nuclear norm to improve the performance of low-rank approximation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. WSN-Induced Low-Rank Model</head><p>Here, we introduce WSN, which is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A w,S p = ⎛ ⎝ min{n,m} i=1 w i σ p i ⎞ ⎠ 1 p (7)</formula><p>where 0 &lt; p ≤ 1, and w = [w 1 , . . . , w min{n,m} ] is a nonnegative vector, involving unequal treatment for different rank components. Then, the WSN of a matrix A to the power p is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">A p w,S p = min{n,m} i=1 w i σ p i = tr(W Δ p )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where both W and Δ are diagonal matrices whose diagonal entries are comprised of w i and σ i , respectively. The widely used nuclear norm can be represented by choosing p = 1 and w = [1, 1, . . . , 1]</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A S 1 = ⎛ ⎝ min{n,m} i=1 σ i ⎞ ⎠ = Tr (A T A) 1 2 . (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>As w = [1, 1, . . . , 1] and p becomes small, it is closer to the original rank constraint, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">lim p→0 Tr(A T A) p 2 = lim p→0 k σ p k = rank(A).<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Here, we define 0 0 = 0. Given a matrix Y, the WSN minimization (WSNM) model aims to find a matrix A, which is as close to Y as possible under F -norm data fidelity and WSN, i.e.,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Â = arg min</head><formula xml:id="formula_12">A A -Y 2 F + λ A p w,S p . (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>Here, we will illustrate the advantage of WSNM compared with NNM. Therefore, a test is used to point out that NNM suffers from a problem: The obtained singular values are overshrunk, which leads to solution deviation. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, we apply both WSNM and NNM to perform low-rank approximation on the subcube [see Fig. i } be the singular values of the optimal solution X * p of model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, and {δ i } be the singular values of the matrix achieved by NNM. Then, we show their plots in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b</ref>). Since NNM is solved by singular value thresholding (SVT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, which shrinks each singular value with a same amount, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b), one can see that the {δ i } (denoted by blue line) are deviated far from {σ i } (denoted by red line), meaning that the overshrinkage is serious. On the contrary, when the nondescending order of w (w</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">1 ≤ w 2 ≤ • • • ≤ w min{n,m}</formula><p>) is involved, the large singular values are shrunk less to preserve the major data components with the shrinkage being proportional to the weight, as it is shown by the green line. Moreover, as p decreases, the nonzero singular values are more approaching to those of the groundtruth matrix (see the cyan line with p = 0.3), representing the effectiveness of the original low-rank assumption for LRMA. Generally, the nondescending order of w is meaningful for most restoration applications because the components with larger singular values need to be penalized less than smaller ones; hence, the preservation of major data components can be guaranteed.</p><p>Similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b), we also illustrate the advantage of WSNM compared with SNM, whose performance outperforms NNM as it is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(c), we apply all the WSNM, SNM, and NNM to perform low-rank approximation on the subcube [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(a)</ref>]. The curve marked by the cyan line represents the singular values of the optimal solution X of WSNM, and the green curve and the blue curve are represented as the singular values of the optimal solution of SNM and NNM, respectively. It is easy to see that the solutions of SNM and NNM are overshrunk and deviated far from the ground truth (denoted by the red line). Therefore, this test demonstrates that WSNM could achieve a better solution of LRMA than traditional SNM.</p><p>To sum up, the good properties mentioned earlier motivate us to introduce WSN as the low-rank regularizer. Consequently, the proposed WSN-LRMA model for HSI restoration can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">min A,E C A p w,S p + λ E 1 s.t. D = A + E + N, N F ≤ η (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where C and λ represent the weights for the low-rank penalty and sparse constraint, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. WSNM-LRMA Optimization</head><p>The augmented Lagrangian function of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> is</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">L(A, E, N, Γ, β) = C A p w,S p + λ E 1 -Γ, A + E + N -D + β 2 A + E + N -D 2 F (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where Γ is the Lagrange multiplier, and β &gt; 0 is the penalty parameter for the violation of the linear constraint, and • denotes the standard trace inner product.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Iterative Hyperspectral Image Restoration</head><p>Here, we explain how to integrate the proposed WSN-LRMA model into an iterative framework to construct an effective restoration method. Here, we first determine the weights for WSN in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Let δ j (A) denote the jth solution of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">14</ref>), an intuitive way for setting weights is that the weight should be inversely proportional to δ j (A), then, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">w j = β √ B (δ j (A) + ε) (<label>23</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">)</formula><p>where ε is set to 10 -16 to avoid dividing by zero, and β = 2 √ 2η 2 , in which η 2 denotes noise variance. Here, we provide a reasonable explanation for this weight setting. According to the studies on wavelet-based image denoising <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, the thumb rule for choosing the threshold τ = 2 √ 2σ 2 w /σ x is under the assumption that wavelet coefficients observe independent and identically distributed Laplacian distribution, where σ w is the noise variance, and σ x denotes the standard deviation of wavelet coefficients. The value of threshold needs to be inversely proportional to σ x such that the major components of data can be preserved since the major energy are kept only in the first few components in Laplacian distribution. In our weight setting, the empirical distribution of δ j (A) can also be approximately modeled by a Laplacian distribution as the curve of singular values of hyperspectral data presents Laplacian distribution, which is demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>. Therefore, an intuitive way for setting weights is that the weight should be inversely proportional to δ j (A), leading to a nondescending order of w i . Such a kind of weights will make sure that the components with larger singular values should be penalized less than smaller ones; hence, the preservation of major data components can be guaranteed.</p><p>Since δ j (A) is unavailable at first, it can be initialized by</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">δ j (A) = max σ 2 j (D) -Bη 2 , 0<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where σ j (D) denotes the jth singular value of matrix D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suppose x(k)</head><p>i represent the ith band image of the restored result in kth iteration, to restore noisy image iteratively; we adopt the iterative regularization scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which is to add filtered noise back to the denoised image as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">d (k) i = x(k-1) i + α d i - x(k-1) i (<label>25</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_43">)</formula><p>where α is a relaxation parameter (we set α = 0.1 in all the experiments). Inspired by this iterative scheme, the estimation of noise variance can be updated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">η (k+1) = γ η (k) 2 - 1 B B i=1 d i -d (k) i 2 2 (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_45">)</formula><p>where γ is a scaling factor controlling the reestimation of noise variance. An intuitive explanation of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_42">25</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_44">26</ref>) is as follows. As the iteration begins, only strong signals (with large singular values) can survive generalized soft-thresholding (GST) and contribute to the restored result x(k-1) i ; however, partially recovered signal will be fed back to the noisy observation via <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, which helps lower the estimation of noise. In return, weaker signals containing useful image details can be identified and added back to the signal estimation. As the iteration progresses, one can observe that the estimated noise variance monotonically decreases [as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>]; meanwhile, image structures are progressively recovered until the convergence.</p><p>By applying the given procedures to each subcube and aggregating all filtered patches together band by band, the final reconstructed image x can be obtained. In the patchbased restoration method, the image patches are sampled with overlapping regions, and most of the pixels are covered by several restored patches. The value of each pixel in each band of HSI is then determined by taking the average of the restored patches at this pixel. Such a kind of operation is referred to as the patch aggregation, which is used to suppress the possible artifacts in the neighborhood of the boundaries of patches. The whole denoising algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 3. Moreover, the performance gain from iterative regularization is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, where the values of mean peak signal-to-noise ratio [the definition can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>] is increasing during the iterative regularization on the simulated data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS</head><p>This section presents extensive experimental validation of the proposed HSI restoration method on both simulated and real data sets. To this end, both qualitative and quantitative methods are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods. To promote the culture of reproducible research, source codes and experimental results accompanying this paper can be achieved at https://sites.google.com/site/yuanxiehomepage/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simulated Experiments</head><p>To quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we generated two degraded HSIs with different degrees of noise-level. The Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE) image of the Washington DC Mall, which contains 191 spectral bands with 1208 × 307 pixels per band, is used as the ground truth in our simulated experiment. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, because of the page limitation, only a subregion (256 × 256 × 191) of the whole HSI is used in our experiment as it is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. To facilitate the numerical calculation and visualization, all the bands of the HSI are normalized into [0, 1] and then will be stretched to original level after restored. To test the performance of the different restoration The number of dead lines in each bands randomly changes between 3 and 10, and the width of dead lines is from 1 to 3 pixels. 4) Stripes are simulated for the bands from 111 to 150 with the width between 1 and 3 pixels. The number of the stripes in each bands randomly changes from 3 to 10.</p><p>Compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the simulated configuration in our experiment is much more challenging. First, the number of bands affected by spare noise (including impulse noise, dead lines, and stripes) is more than that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Second, an additional severe Gaussian noise with the variance 0.196 is applied to contaminate all the bands. Recovery under such a difficult condition can thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In all the experiments, as for the step size (which denotes the overlap between two neighborhood subcubes), if we select a very small value, the computational burden will become unacceptable, and if we choose a big value, the result will present artifacts. Therefore, setting the step size to 4 is a good choice like in many patch-based denoising method. As for the number of iterations K, since it can be observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> that the MPSNR increment becomes quite small after six iterations, we set K = 6 to avoid unnecessary computation. The subcube size and the parameters C, λ and p are set to 20 × 20, 0.007, 1.2, and 0.7, respectively, which will be discussed in detail in Section IV-C. We compare the proposed method with seven representative denoising algorithms: the hard-threshold wavelet denoising (Wavelet) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, the spectral-spatial adaptive total variation model (SSAHTV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the spectral-spatial view fusion strategy (SSVF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the video block matching 3-D filtering (VBM3D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, the GoDec-based low-rank matrix recovery (LRMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the noise-adjusted LRMA (NAI-LRMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and the LRMR in low-energy PCA channels (pLRMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The respective authors provide the SSAHTV, VBM3D, and SSVF codes, and the parameter settings of the former two methods are similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>; the last one remains unchanged. We have implemented the codes for the other algorithms, which remain faithful to the original papers. It is worth noting that all the LRMR, NAI-LRMA, and pLRMR methods belong to the low-rank-based scheme, which means a comprehensive comparison in our experiment.</p><p>a) Visual quality comparison: In terms of visual quality, some representative bands of restored HSI obtained by different methods are presented in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>. The results recovered from pure Gaussian noise with variance 0.212 at band 50 are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, where noticeable differences in visual quality can be observed. The local details in the regions marked by the green dashed boxes indicate the distorted results obtained by the VBM3D, LRMR, and NAI-LRMA. As a certain degree of noise still exists in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(e) (pLRMR), the best approximation is achieved by the proposed method.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows the restoration results of band 20, which is corrupted by Gaussian noise (variance 0.097) and impulse noise. It    </p><formula xml:id="formula_46">PSNR i (27) MSSIM = 1 B B i=1 SSIM i (<label>28</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_47">)</formula><p>where PSNR i and SSIM i denote the PSNR and SSIM values for the ith band, respectively. The values of MPSNR and MSSIM for all the competitors are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>, where the proposed method achieves the best results whether in the moderate noise case or in the severe noise case. To perform the quantitative comparison from details, the PSNR and SSIM values of each band of restoration results obtained by different competitors are also calculated and drawn in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>. It can be observed that, for almost all the bands, the PSNR and SSIM values of the proposed method (denoted by the red curves) are higher than those of the other seven methods under both moderate   Furthermore, to conduct quantitative comparison thoroughly, the spectral signatures are also calculated for all the methods. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> demonstrates the spectral signatures of pixel (200, 53), which belongs to the roof class, under moderate noise case. The horizontal axis of figure represents spectral band numbers, and the vertical axis denotes digital-number values. It is obvious that the curve shape of the spectral signatures acquired by the proposed method [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10(j)</ref>] closely resembles that of the spectral signatures in the noise-free spectrum, which can be further confirmed by the difference in the spectral signatures between the noise-free and the restored results, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>, where the flattest curve means the best restoration result. Similar results can be found in Figs. 12 and 13 for other pixels and noise levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Real Data Experiments</head><p>Here, three real-world HSI data sets with varying degrees of mixture noise are used in our experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Two HYDICE data sets called Urban and Terrain have similar degrees of corruption, i.e., most of the bands are clean but with only a few ones being contaminated by mixture noise: severe noise mixed by Gaussian  noise, impulse noise, and stripes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">14(a)</ref>; severe noise mixed by Gaussian noise, dead lines, and stripes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">15(a)</ref>; and moderate noise mixed by Gaussian noise, dead lines, and stripes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16(a)</ref>. The other hyperspectral sequence, which is referred to as Australia, is obtained from the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion data set, where most of bands contain Gaussian noise, and what is more, about one third of bands are heavily corrupted by mixture noise, e.g., band 88 simultaneously contains the severe Gaussian noise and many stripes, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17</ref> In real data experiments, the parameters of all the methods are fixed for all the data sets. The parameters of the proposed method has been mentioned in Section IV-A. The regularization parameters in both SSAHTV and SSVF are set to 5. For the VBM3D method, the noise variation set to 15, and the same preprocessing step has been adopted to handle impulse noise as done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The upper bound values of the rank r and cardinality k in LRMR are set to 4 and 4000, respectively. For the NAI-LRMA, we choose the decay parameter c = 5 and iteration factor δ = 0.4; other parameters are the same with LRMR. For the pLRMR method, the number of clusters k = 50 is adopted in the k-means algorithm.</p><p>a) HYDICE urban data set: This HSI with original size of 304 × 304 × 210 can be downloaded online at http://www. erdc.usace.army.mil/. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the final test data is cut to 304 × 304 × 189 since several bands polluted by atmosphere and water absorption have been removed. The seven best results in visual quality are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">14</ref> for the sake of space limits, and similar rule is also applied to other test data sets. The methods VBM3D, SSAHTV, LRMR, and ours can remove such a kind of badly mixture noise. However, the results obtained by VBM3D and SSAHTV tend to oversmooth, incurring information loss in local details (highlighted in green windows). The result of LRMR presents blur effect, which can be clearly seen in the yellow dashed boxes and zoomed windows in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">14</ref> and<ref type="figure"></ref>    and NAI-LRMA, some stripes can be eliminated, whereas Gaussian noise and parts of dead lines still exist. Even for LRMR, dead lines cannot be removed thoroughly, leaving some fractions in restored result [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16(f)</ref>]. The visual comparison confidently indicates that the proposed method outperforms the other methods on Terrain data set. Here, we give a reasonable explanation: the WSN-LRMA model can well preserve the major data components as well as achieve accurately LRMA, which means that sharp local details could be faithful recovered, and the separation between low-rank part and sparse part would become easy. Furthermore, estimating η iteratively will help suppress Gaussian noise more effectively.</p><p>c) EO-1 Hyperion Australia data set: The EO-1 Hyperion L1R-level Australia data set is selected for our third real data experiment. This Hyperion image is captured on 4 December 2010 with the location at Australia. The original image is of size 256 × 3858 × 242 and can be downloaded online at http://remote-sensing.nci.org.au/. After removing the overlapping bands between visual near-infrared and shortwave infrared ranges, there are 150 bands remaining for restoration. For simplicity, the final test image is cut to the size of 256 × 400 × 150. It is obvious that SSVF, pLRMR, and NAI-LRMA fail to remove stripes, whereas VBM3D, SSAHTV, and LRMR can partly handle such noise but with effects of artifacts [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17(b</ref>) and (f)] and oversmooth [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17(c)</ref>]. Only the proposed method achieves a desirable result, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17(h</ref>), in which the farmlands and hills can be found clearly. Even more noticeable differences are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">18</ref>; as for handling the dead lines, all the restored results are presented varying degrees of ghost shadow, except for the result of the proposed method.</p><p>Moreover, some of the dropped bands, which are severely polluted by noise or totally out of range for visualization, have been put back to test the robustness of the proposed method. Some representative restoration results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">19</ref>, which also demonstrates the excellent performance of the proposed method for handling such heavy noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Model Analysis</head><p>We will discuss some critical parameters in the restoration model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. There are subcube size and parameters C, λ, and p. For the subcube size, its value does not have a large effect on the restoration results in our proposed method. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref> shows the MPSNR and MSSIM values of the results obtained by our proposed method with different subcube sizes under moderate noise level. It can be observed that WSN-LRMA is not very sensitive to the size of the HSI subcube, except for the size 8,  and we choose w = h = 20 for it achieving the best result. The proposed method with a too small patch size cannot capture a meaningful image local content, leading to an undesirable restoration results. C and λ represent weights for low-rank penalty and sparse penalty, respectively; p is the power related to Schatten norm. For simplicity, we first analyze the restoration performance affected by different C and λ when the power p is fixed. Then, various values of p will be evaluated under the optimal C and λ. Recalling the restoration model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">12</ref>), the parameter C can be absorbed into λ. However, during the procedure of ALM, the low-rank regularization and the sparse regularization are solved separately. Thus, using parameter C explicitly will make the subproblem (14) more flexible in setting the weights for WSN. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">20</ref> presents the quantitative evaluation of different C and λ in the simulated experiment under moderate noise level. It is quite obvious that the shape of all the curves fall into similar pattern, which means that the results of the proposed WSN-LRMA restoration method are robust to the combination of parameters C and λ.</p><p>Given the optimal values of C and λ, it is necessary for us to investigate the influence of the changing power p upon the quality of restored results. The MPSNR values in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">21</ref> show   the influence on simulated data under both noise levels. In this the power are changing from 0.1 to 1 with an interval 0.1. The of p, which is marked by red circle in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">21</ref> is in accord with the conclusion drawn by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> since such a choice (p = 0.7) achieves a balance between enforcing low-rank and separating sparse outliers.</p><p>Additionally, the computational complexity of the proposed method will be discussed. For a matrix of size h 2 × B, in each iteration of the Algorithm 1, since the SVD actually dominates the main computation of the subproblem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">14</ref>), it needs O(min{h 2 B 2 , h 4 B} + JB) flops, where J denotes the number of iterations in the GST algorithm. Both computational demands for subproblems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> are O(h 2 B). Therefore, for each subcube of the HSI data, the amount of K × T × O(min{h 2 B 2 , h 4 B} + JB + 2h 2 B) flops are required for the proposed method, where K is the number of regularization steps in Algorithm 3, and T denotes the number of iterations in ALM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, a WSN-based LRMA approach has been proposed for HSI restoration with iterative regularization. By transforming the HSI restoration into an LRMA problem, a   The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method makes impressively quantitative improvements over state-ofthe-art methods, as well as preserves much better image local structures and details on visual quality. Additionally, as it is known to all, a patch can be naturally represented as a matrix. However, current LRMA methods for HSI restoration always need vectorized operation to change an image patch to a vector, discarding the neighboring relationship inside the patch. In contrast, tensor-based representation can preserve the spatial information much better. Therefore, as a future direction, it is reasonable for us to extend the proposed WSN to the case of low-rank tensor approximation or tensor discriminative analysis such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, although further adaptations are likely.</p></div>
