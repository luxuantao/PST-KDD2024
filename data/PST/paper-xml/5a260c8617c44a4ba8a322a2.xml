<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Evolutionary many-objective optimization has been gaining increasing attention from the evolutionary computation research community. Much effort has been devoted to addressing this issue by improving the scalability of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, such as Pareto-based, decomposition-based, and indicatorbased approaches. Different from current work, we propose an alternative algorithm in this paper called AnD, which consists of an angle-based selection strategy and a shift-based density estimation strategy. These two strategies are employed in the environmental selection to delete poor individuals one by one. Specifically, the former is devised to find a pair of individuals with the minimum vector angle, which means that these two individuals have the most similar search directions. The latter, which takes both diversity and convergence into account, is adopted to compare these two individuals and to delete the worse one. AnD has a simple structure, few parameters, and no complicated operators. The performance of AnD is compared with that of seven state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on a variety of benchmark test problems with up to 15 objectives. The results suggest that AnD can achieve highly competitive performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) refer to optimization problems with more than one conflicting objective. Usually, a MOP can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">minimize F(x) = (f 1 (x), f 2 (x), ..., f m (x)) subject to x ∈ Ω<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x = (x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ) is the decision vector, n is the number of decision variables, F(x) is the objective vector, m is the number of objectives, and Ω is the decision space. The ultimate goal of multiobjective optimization is to obtain a set of well-distributed and well-converged nondominated solutions to approximate the Pareto front (PF). To achieve this goal, numerous multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed over the last few decades. According to their selection mechanisms, MOEAs can be roughly classified into three categories: Pareto-based methods, decomposition-based methods, and indicatorbased methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. MOEAs have shown great potential to solve MOPs with two or three objectives. However, for MOPs with more than three objectives, often known as many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), they encounter substantial difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>For Pareto-based methods, such as NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and SPEA2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, the selection criteria (i.e., the Pareto-based selection and the diversity-based selection) may lose their effectiveness to push the population toward the PF. This is because with an increase in the number of objectives, the proportion of nondominated solutions increases drastically. As a result, the Pareto-based (primary) selection fails to distinguish the individuals in the population. Under this condition, the diversity-based (secondary) selection will play a major role in the selection process. The secondary selection may distribute the population well over the objective space; however, the population tends to be far away from the desired PF due to the neglect of convergence performance. Decomposition-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and indicator-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> methods do not suffer from selection pressure issues since they do not rely on Pareto dominance to evolve the population. However, they face their own challenges. Regarding decomposition-based methods, it is not a trivial task to assign the weight vectors or reference points in the high-dimensional objective space <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In addition, indicator-based methods always result in high computational time complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>To enhance the scalability of MOEAs for MaOPs, a considerable number of attempts have been made to improve the performance of Pareto-based, decompositionbased, and indicator-based methods. These are briefly introduced next.</p><p>• Pareto-based Methods: Recognizing the drawback of the Pareto-dominance relation for MaOPs, this kind of method intends to modify/relax the definition of Pareto dominance. Along this line, several rules have been proposed such as -dominance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, L-dominance <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, and fuzzy dominance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, another avenue is to develop customized diversity mechanisms, with the purpose of alleviating the loss of selection pressure. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a diversity management mechanism is introduced, which can determine whether or not to activate diversity promotion based on the distribution of population. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, a shift-based density estimation strategy is proposed, which shifts the poorly converged individuals into crowded regions and assigns them high density values. As a result, these individuals are very likely to be removed from the population. Inspired by the idea that the knee points are naturally most preferred among nondominated solutions, a knee pointdriven EA is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, in which diversity is embedded in the knee point identification process.</p><p>• Decomposition-based Methods: This kind of method contains two different types. The first type decomposes a MaOP into a series of single-objective optimization problems. MOEA/D <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> is the most famous one. In MOEA/D, a set of weight vectors are predefined to specify multiple search directions toward the PF. Since the search directions spread out widely, it is expected that the obtained solutions cover the PF well. MOEA/D was originally designed for solving MOPs. Recent advances have successfully adapted MOEA/D to solve MaOPs. Examples include adaptively allocating search effort in MOEA/D-AM2M <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, exploiting the perpendicular distance from the solution to the weight vector in MOEA/D-DU <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and using Pareto adaptive scalarizing methods in MOEA/D-PaS <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The second type divides a MaOP into a group of sub-MaOPs. One representative is NSGA-III <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which makes use of a set of predefined well-distributed reference points to manage nondominated solutions. That is, the nondominated solutions close to the reference points are prioritized. For these two types, to achieve good performance, a crucial issue is how to assign the appropriate weight vectors or reference points. To this end, an automatic weight vector generation system is devised in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and a two-layered generation strategy for reference points is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T</p><p>• Indicator-based Methods: In this kind of method, the indicator values are used to guide the search process. Among all the indicators, the hypervolume indicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> is the most commonly used, which is originally a quality indicator to compare different MOEAs. The hypervolume indicator has an attractive property, that is, it is strictly monotonic with regard to Pareto dominance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Note, however, that the burden for calculating hypervolume is very high, and increases exponentially as the number of objectives increases. To overcome this shortcoming, the Monte Carlo simulation is employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to approximate the exact hypervolume values, with the aim of striking a tradeoff between accuracy and computational time. Additionally, there are some cheap indicators, such as the I ( ) + indicator in IBEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and the R2 indicator in R2-EMOA <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The collaboration of different cheap indicators seems to be a promising direction for solving MaOPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Apart from these three categories, several preference-based many-objective EAs (MaOEAs) have been proposed recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> which focus on a subset of the PF based on the user's preference. There are also some dimensionality reduction approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, aiming to deal with MaOPs with redundant objectives. Additionally, researchers have tried to take advantage of the merits offered by different categories. Two representatives are MOEA/DD and Two Arch2. MOEA/DD <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is based on Pareto dominance and decomposition, and Two Arch2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is based on Pareto dominance and an indicator. For more information about MaOEAs, interested readers are referred to a survey paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Unlike recent work, we propose an alternative MaOEA, called AnD. In evolutionary many-objective optimization, the task of environmental selection is to choose some promising individuals from the union population, which is composed of the parent and offspring populations, for the next generation. AnD tackles this task by two strategies: angle-based selection and shift-based density estimation. First, angle-based selection finds a pair of individuals with the minimum vector angle. Intuitively, it is necessary to delete one of these two individuals since they search in the most similar directions and it will waste significant computational resources if they coexist. In order to make the deletion wiser, we need to take both convergence and diversity into account since achieving balance between convergence and diversity is the most important concern in many-objective optimization. Fortunately, shift-based density estimation has the capability to cover both the distribution and convergence information of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Therefore, it is utilized to compare these two individuals and to delete the worse one. By repeating this process, AnD provides a quite natural way for solving MaOPs-the individuals</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>with poor diversity and convergence are eliminated from the union population one by one.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p><p>• We design AnD as an alternative MaOEA that has a simple structure, few parameters, and no complicated operators. More importantly, AnD is different from existing methods because it does not use dominance rules, weight vectors/reference points, and indicators. As a consequence, it has the following advantages for solving MaOPs: no disadvantages incurred from insufficient selection pressure as in Pareto-based methods, no need to assign weight vectors/reference points as in decomposition-based methods, and no need to consume a high computational cost as in indicator-based methods.</p><p>• The vector angle <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> and shift-based density estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> have been extensively investigated in the design of MaOEAs, respectively. However, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to effectively combine them together for solving MaOPs, by making use of their complementary properties. Moreover, AnD provides a straightforward way to achieve both diversity and convergence-by identifying the two individuals with the minimum vector angle via angle-based selection and removing the one with worse diversity and convergence via shift-based density estimation in an iterative way.</p><p>• Systematic experiments have been conducted on both the DTLZ and WFG test suites to demonstrate the effectiveness of AnD. The performance of AnD is compared with that of seven state-of-the-art MaOEAs. The experimental results suggest that, overall, AnD can achieve better performance in terms of two widely used performance metrics: IGD <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and HV <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>• AnD has been further extended to solve constrained MaOPs with promising performance.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces preliminary knowledge. The details of AnD are presented in Section 3. Subsequently, the experimental setup is described in Section 4. The empirical results on both unconstrained and constrained MaOPs are given in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Vector Angle</head><p>In this paper, the vector angle denotes the included angle between two individuals in the normalized objective space. The normalized objective vector of an individual is computed as follows. First, we find the ideal point Z min = (z min are the minimum and maximum values of the ith objective of all individuals, respectively. Afterward, for the jth individual x j , its objective vector F(x j ) is normalized as F (x j ) = (f 1 (x j ), f 2 (x j ), ..., f m (x j )) according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f i (x j ) = f i (x j ) -z min i z max i -z min i , i = 1, 2, ..., m.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>After the normalization, the vector angle between two individuals x j and x l , referred to as θ x j ,x l , is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">θ x j ,x l = arccos F (x j ) • F (x l ) F (x j ) × F (x l ) . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where F (x j ) • F (x l ) denotes the inner product of F (x j ) and F (x l ), and • calculates the norm of a vector. It is clear that θ x j ,x l ∈ 0, π 2 . In principle, the vector angle reflects the similarity of search directions between two individuals. To be specific, if two individuals search in quite different directions, the vector angle between them is large; otherwise, the vector angle is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>small. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> gives an example. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we can observe that: 1) individuals A and D search in quite different directions, and θ A,D is relatively larger; and 2) individuals B and C share similar search directions, and θ B,C is relatively smaller.</p><p>During the past two years, the vector angle has attracted a high level of interest for evolutionary many-objective optimization. For instance, it has been incorporated into decomposition-based approaches. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, a reference-vector-guided EA (RVEA) for many-objective optimization is proposed. In RVEA, the anglepenalized distance is used to balance the convergence and diversity of individuals in the high-dimensional objective space. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, a novel decomposition-based MaOEA called MOEA/D-LWS is proposed. In MOEA/D-LWS, for each search direction, the optimal solution is selected only among its neighboring solutions. Note that the neighborhood is defined by a hypercone, whose apex angle is determined automatically a priori. Very recently, a new variant of MOEA/D with sorting-and-selection (MOEA/D-SAS) has been presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In MOEA/D-SAS, the balance between convergence and diversity is achieved by two distinctive components: decomposition-based sorting and angle-based selection. In the latter, the angle information between two individuals in the objective space is used to maintain diversity. In addition, the vector angle also has the potential to improve the performance of Pareto-based approaches. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, a vector-angle-based EA (VaEA) for unconstrained many-objective optimization is developed. VaEA implements the nondominated sorting procedure to obtain different layers, and deals with the last layer through the vector angle.</p><p>Other kinds of attempts have also been made to solve MaOPs with the use of the vector angle. For example, He and Yen <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> suggested a MaOEA based on a coordinate selection strategy (MaOEA-CSS), in which a new diversity measure based on the vector angle is designed in the mating and environmental selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Shift-based Density Estimation</head><p>Shift-based density estimation is an advanced density estimation strategy proposed by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Compared with traditional density estimation, it shifts the positions of other individuals when estimating the density of an individual (e.g., x j ) in the population P. This shift process is simple and is based on the convergence comparison between other individuals and x j on each objective. To be specific, if x l (suppose that x l is another individual in P) outperforms x j on one objective, its objective value on this objective will be shifted to the same position of x j on this objective; otherwise, its objective value remains unchanged. This shift process can be described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f s i (x l ) = f i (x j ), iff i (x l ) &lt; f i (x j ) f i (x l ), otherwise .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where f s i (x l ) is the shifted objective value of f i (x l ), and F s (x l ) = (f s 1 (x l ), f s 2 (x l ), ..., f s m (x l )) is the shifted objective vector of F (x l ). Note that before shifting, the objective vector of each individual is normalized via Eq. (2).</p><p>To understand the shift process more clearly, we take shift-based density estimation of individual B(0.6, 0.9) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> as an example. First, individuals A(0, 1), C(0.7, 0.4), and D(1, 0) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> are shifted to individuals A (0.6, 1), C (0.7, 0.9), and D (1, 0.9), respectively, due to the fact that A 1 = 0 &lt; B 1 = 0.6, C 2 = 0.4 &lt; B 2 = 0.9, and D 2 = 0 &lt; B 2 = 0.9. Subsequently, it can be observed that the poorly converged individual B is located in a crowded region. Thus, B will be assigned a high density value and is very likely to be removed from the population. It is noteworthy that in order to obtain the density of an individual, the shift process should be combined with a density estimator, such as the crowding distance in NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the kth nearest neighbor in SPEA2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, or the grid crowding degree in PESA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Actually, as pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, only the individual with both good diversity and good convergence will have a low density value, which means that both diversity and convergence are elaborately considered in the shift-based density estimation strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>In this paper, we integrate shift-based density estimation with the kth nearest neighbor to estimate the density of individual x j in P, denoted as SD(x j ). The implementation is the following:</p><p>1. Shift the normalized objective vectors of the other individuals in P via Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">4</ref>); 2. Calculate the Euclidian distances between the other shifted normalized objective vectors and F (x j ) according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">d(x j , x l ) = F s (x l ) -F (x j ) , x l ∈ P ∩ x l = x j .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>3. Find the kth minimum value (x k ) in the set of {d(x j , x l ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x l ∈ P ∩ x l = x j },</formula><p>where k is set to √ N and N is the size of P; 4. Compute SD(x j ) according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">SD(x j ) = 1 (x k ) + 2 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Note that the higher the density value, the worse the performance of an individual. The shift-based density estimation strategy has become an important technique in evolutionary many-objective optimization. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, it can significantly enhance the scalability of NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, SPEA2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, and PESA2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for solving MaOPs. Moreover, SPEA2 achieves better performance than NSGA-II and PESA2 after these three algorithms are integrated with shift-based density estimation. Recently, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> presented a cooperative differential evolution with multiple populations (CMODE) for multi-and many-objective optimization. From the results, the combination of CMODE and shift-based density estimation reaches outstanding performance when solving MaOPs. Very recently, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> presented a stochastic ranking-based multi-indicator algorithm (SRA). SRA adopts the stochastic ranking technique to balance the search biases of different indicators. Among these indicators, one is designed based on shift-based density estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Proposed Approach</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">AnD</head><p>The framework of AnD is given in Algorithm 1. First, a population P 0 with N individuals is randomly initialized in the decision space Ω. During the evolution, an offspring population Q t is generated from P t through mating. Afterward,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Algorithm 1 The framework of AnD</head><p>Input: a MaOP and the population size N Output: the population P 1: Initialization(P 0 ); 2: t ← 0 3: while the stopping criterion is not met do 4:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Q t ← Mating(P t ) ; 5: U t ← P t Q t ;</formula><p>6:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P t+1 ← Enviromental-Selection(U t ) 7:</formula><p>t ← t + 1; 8: end while a union population U t is obtained by combining Q t with P t . Finally, the environmental selection is performed on U t to produce the next population P t+1 . The above procedure repeats until the stopping criterion is met.</p><p>It can be seen that similar to most MaOEAs, AnD involves two main components: mating and environmental selection. The aim of mating is to generate a number of offspring (i.e., Q t ) from the parents (i.e., P t ) by making use of evolutionary operators, such as selection, crossover, and mutation. AnD does not apply any explicit selection to choose parents from P t or employ any special crossover and mutation to generate offspring. Instead, the parents are randomly chosen from P t , and the simulated binary crossover (SBX) and the polynomial mutation are utilized to generate Q t . The reasons are twofold: 1) the random selection, SBX, and the polynomial mutation have been widely used in the community of evolutionary many-objective optimization; and 2) we would like to ensure a fair comparison with other algorithms. The unique characteristic of AnD lies in its environmental selection, which is described in the sequel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Environmental Selection</head><p>The environmental selection aims at choosing N individuals with the most potential from the union population U t for the next generation. AnD accomplishes this by two strategies: angle-based selection and shift-based density estimation. Algorithm 2 describes the environmental selection of AnD. Firstly, the vector angles between any two individuals in U t are calculated. Thereafter, angle-based selection is conducted to identify two individuals (denoted as u j and u l ) with the minimum vector angle in U t . Subsequently, shift-based density estimation is employed to compare u j and u l , and the one with a higher density value is Find two individuals (denoted as u j and u l ) with the smallest vector angle in U t ;</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Algorithm 2 Environmental-Selection(U t ) Input: U t which</formula><p>4:</p><p>Calculate SD(u j ) and SD(u l ) according to Section 2.2;</p><p>5:</p><p>if SD(u j ) &lt; SD(u l ) then 6:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">U t ← U t \u l ; // delete u l from U t 7: else 8: U t ← U t \u j ; // delete u j from U t 9:</formula><p>end if 10: end while 11: P t+1 ← U t ; removed from U t . This process proceeds until the size of U t is equal to N . Next, we explain the importance of the combination of these two strategies in AnD.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 2.1, the vector angle reflects the similarity between two individuals in their search directions. If two individuals share the minimum vector angle, they absolutely have the most similar search directions. To improve the diversity of search directions, one of them should be discarded. If we repeatedly delete one of two individuals with the most similar search directions in the remaining population, the diversity of search directions will be well maintained in the final population. Indeed, the main idea behind angle-based selection is to approximate the PF from diverse search directions. Decomposition-based approaches, which have shown great success in solving MaOPs, also use a similar idea. However, compared with decomposition-based approaches, angle-based selection only exploits the information provided by the vector angle.</p><p>Although angle-based selection is able to find a pair of individuals with the most similar search directions, it cannot distinguish them. In many-objective optimization, when comparing two individuals, it has been widely accepted that both diversity and convergence should be considered. Fortunately, shift-based density estimation provides an effective way to measure the quality of two individuals because it focuses on both the diversity and convergence of individuals as introduced in Section 2.2. As a result, shift-based density estimation has the capability to judge which individual is worse and should be deleted under this condition.</p><p>Overall, the environmental selection of AnD combines angle-based selection and shift-based density estimation in a quite natural way: the former identifies the </p></div>

Therefore, by iteratively implementing both of them, the individuals with poor diversity and convergence are deleted one by one from U t ; thus, the population continuously approaches the PF with good diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Analysis of the Principle</head><p>An example in a two-dimensional objective space is used to illustrate the working principles of six MaOEAs: NSGA-III <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, SPEA2+SDE (a combination of SPEA2 and shift-based density estimation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, MOEA/D <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, MOEA/DD <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, HypE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and AnD. Suppose that there are six individuals (i.e., A(0,0.9), B(0.7,1), C(1,0.3), D(0.7,0.15), E(0.9,0.05), and F(0,1)) in the population, and our task is to select four promising individuals for the next generation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> depicts what happens to the six compared methods.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we can give the following comments:</p><p>• In both NSGA-III and SPEA2+SDE, A, D, E, and F are selected for the next generation. The reason is that these two algorithms prefer nondominated individuals. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> • With respect to MOEA/D, suppose that there are four weight vectors (i.e., w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , and w 4 ) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(b), and that the Tchebycheff approach is used. According to the principle of MOEA/D with the Tchebycheff approach, each weight vector is associated with an individual. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(b), it is clear that w 1 and w 2 are associated with A; w 3 is associated with D; and w 4 is associated with F. Therefore, A, D and F will survive into the next generation. In particular, A will be duplicated. The other individuals (i.e., B, C, and E) will be eliminated.</p><p>• For MOEA/DD, A, B, C, and F will survive into the next generation. This is because the weight vectors in MOEA/DD are used to divide the objective space into a series of subregions. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(c), we can see that A, B, and C are in their own isolated subregions, and all of them will be selected into the next generation. D, E, and F are in the same subregion, and only the boundary individual F will be chosen for the next generation. • To implement AnD, firstly, it is necessary to calculate the vector angles between any two individuals in the population. Subsequently, we need to identify two individuals with the minimum vector angle and employ the shiftbased density estimation strategy to differentiate them. It is easy to find that θ E,F is the minimum vector angle in the population. Then, according to Section 2, we can obtain the density values of E and F as SD(E) ≈ 0.4762 and SD(F) ≈ 0.4651, respectively. Thus, E will be removed from the population since it has the higher density value. After E has been eliminated, θ C,D becomes the minimum vector angle and the density values of C and D are computed as SD(C) = 0.5 and SD(D) ≈ 0.4348, respectively. Thereafter, C will be removed from the population due to its higher density value. In summary, C and E will be eliminated from the population, while A, B, D, and F will be chosen for the next generation.</p><p>From the above discussions, we can observe that: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Computational Time Complexity</head><p>The computational time complexity of AnD is dependent mainly on its environmental selection. In Algorithm 2, since the vector angles should be computed between any two individuals in the union population U t of size 2N , the computational time complexity is thus O(mN 2 ). In addition, the computational time complexity of sorting these vector angles is O(N 2 log 2 N ). The implementation of the shift-based density estimation strategy has a time complexity of O(mN 2 ). Therefore, the overall computational time complexity of AnD at one generation is max{O(mN 2 ), O(N 2 log 2 N )}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Discussion</head><p>AnD abandons the use of dominance rules, weight vectors or reference points, and indicators. As a result, AnD alleviates the disadvantages of other MaOEAs to some extent when solving MaOPs, such as the loss of selection pressure in Pareto-based approaches, the requirement of specifying weight vectors or reference points in decomposition-based methods, and the high computational time complexity in hypervolume-based approaches. AnD also has some other good properties. For instance, it has a simple structure, few parameters, and no complicated operators. Actually, it is an effective algorithm for solving both unconstrained and constrained MaOPs as demonstrated in Section 5.</p><p>As introduced in Section 2, RVEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, MOEA/D-LWS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, MOEA/D-SAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, VaEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and MaOEA-CSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> utilize the information of the vector angle, while SPEA2+SDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, CMODE+SDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and SRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> employ shift-based density estimation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Benchmark Test Problems</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the proposed AnD, we applied it to solve two well-known benchmark test suites, namely, the DTLZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and WFG <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> test suites. DTLZ1-DTLZ4 and WFG1-WFG9 with five, 10, and 15 objectives were chosen for our empirical studies. Following the suggestion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the number of decision variables n was set to n = m + k -1 for the DTLZ test suite, where m denotes the number of objectives, k = 5 for DTLZ1, and k = 10 for DTLZ2-DTLZ4.

The IGD metric is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">IGD(P) = 1 |P * | z * ∈P * distance(z * , P).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where distance(z * , P) is the minimum Euclidean distance between z * and all members in P, and |P * | is the cardinality of P * .

It assesses both the convergence and diversity of P, and is the only indicator which is Pareto-compliant <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For a MaOEA, a larger HV value is desirable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Benefit of Two Strategies</head><p>Firstly, we are interested in identifying the benefit of two crucial strategies of AnD: angle-based selection and shift-based density estimation. To this end, two variants of AnD were devised named AnD-WoA and AnD-WoD, respectively. In AnD-WoA, angle-based selection was eliminated. Instead, the individuals in the union population U t were sorted based on their shift-based density values <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and N individuals with the highest density values were removed from U t . In AnD-WoD, shift-based density estimation was abandoned. As an alternative, for two individuals with the minimum vector angle, their Euclidean distances to the ideal point were computed, and the one with the larger Euclidean distance was deleted <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The comparative experiments between AnD and its two variants were carried out on the DTLZ and WFG test suites. The IGD and HV values are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, respectively.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, it is evident that AnD outperforms its two variants on a vast majority of test problems. In terms of the IGD metric, AnD obtains the best performance on 30 out of 39 test problems, while AnD-WoA and AnD-WoD achieve the best performance on only five and four test problems, respectively. With respect to the HV metric, AnD performs the best on 36 test problems. Nevertheless, AnD-WoA and AnD-WoD perform the best on no more than two test problems. The reason for the above results seems obvious. Compared with AnD, AnD-WoA discards angle-based selection, therefore it is unable to maintain the diversity of search directions. Regarding AnD-WoD, it replaces shift-based density estimation with the Euclidean distance. However, the Euclidean distance only considers an individual's convergence property; thus, it is less reasonable    than shift-based density estimation which takes both diversity and convergence into account.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">.4004e -1 1.1292e -1 1.1831e -1 1.8856e -1 2.1156e -1 1.2387e -1 1.2356e -1 1.2504e -1 DTLZ1 15 1.8157e -1 1.6530e -1 1.6486e -1 2.6475e -1 3.1515e -1 1.6710e -1 1.8887e -1 1.9064e -1 DTLZ2 5 1.6124e -1 1.8868e -1 1.6124e -1 1.6125e -1 1.6307e -1 1.6124e -1 1.7374e -1 1.6826e -1 DTLZ2 10 4.1870e -1 3.8855e -1 4.2106e -1 4.9906e -1 4.1920e -1 4.2108e -1 4.5879e -1 3.7456e -1 DTLZ2 15 5.7768e -1 5.5854e -1 5.7862e -1 6.4743e -1 8.3078e -1 5.7824e -1 6.7923e -1 5.4876e -1 DTLZ3 5 1.7390e -1 1.8818e -1 1.6662e -1 1.7486e -1 1.7057e -1 1.6305e -1 2.2382e -1 1.8791e -1 DTLZ3<label>10</label></formula><p>From this discussion, we can conclude that angle-based selection and shiftbased density estimation are two indispensable strategies in AnD.</p></div>

More specifically, SPEA2+SDE performs the best in terms of the IGD metric, followed by MOEA/DD and AnD, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. Nevertheless, MOEA/DD and RVEA obtain the best and second best performance with respect to the HV metric, respectively, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>DTLZ1 is a multimodal problem, in which the PF is degenerate and the decision variables are non-separable. It challenges the convergence performance of an algorithm. We find that SPEA2+SDE achieves the best IGD values on five and 10 objectives, while MOEA/D obtains the best IGD value on 15 objectives. As far as HV is concerned, MOEA/DD outperforms the others on five and 10 objectives, and RVEA beats its competitors on 15 objectives. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the results provided by some methods using weight vectors or reference points (i.e., MOEA/D and MOEA/DD) have better distributions. With respect to SPEA2+SDE and Two Arch2, the scales of some objective values are smaller than the true PF, which suggests that they have a preference on the solutions located in central areas. In terms of AnD, some extreme values for the third, fourth, and sixth objectives occur, which means that AnD has relatively poor convergence performance on DTLZ1.</p><p>DTLZ2 is a relatively simple test problem compared with DTLZ1, which is mainly used to test an algorithm's diversity. AnD achieves the best overall IGD performance, while MOEA/DD obtains the best overall HV performance. In AnD, the diversity of the population is considered in both angle-based selection and shift-based density estimation; therefore, AnD provides promising results on DTLZ2.</p><p>For DTLZ3, which is a highly multimodal problem, SPEA2+SDE achieves the best overall performance in terms of both IGD and HV. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>, it can be seen that the results provided by NSGA-III and Two Arch2 are distant from the PFs on 10 and 15 objectives. AnD obtains medium performance in terms of both IGD and HV.</p><p>Regarding DTLZ4, the density of points on its PF is strongly biased. Therefore, the main challenge for solving this test problem is to maintain the diversity of the population. Similar to DTLZ2, AnD and MOEA/DD obtain the best overall IGD and HV performance, respectively. From Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, it can be observed that Two Arch2 produces some extreme values on the sixth objective, which suggests unstable convergence performance. The results obtained by RVEA, NSGA-III, and MOEA/DD distribute similarly and concentrate mainly on the boundary or the middle parts of the PF. As for MOEA/D, its results fail to cover the fourth and fifth objectives well. Similarly, the results obtained by MOMBI-II are unable to cover the ninth objective well. SPEA2+SDE and AnD are capable of covering the whole PF. The difference between them is that the objective values derived from SPEA2+SDE mainly lie in [0, 0.8], while in AnD, they are well distributed within [0, 1]. </p></div>

Next, we give the detailed discussions.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> shows the IGD values resulting from the eight compared algorithms. Clearly, AnD and RVEA are the two top algorithms, and they have a clear advantage over the other six algorithms on the majority of test problems. Actually, AnD provides the best and second best IGD values on 12 and six out of 27 test problems, respectively. As for RVEA, it generates six best results and nine second best results. In addition, SPEA2+SDE obtains three best results and two second best results, Two Arch2 produces five best results, NSGA-III has one best result and seven second best results, and MOEA/DD and MOMBI-II reach one second best result each. One interesting phenomenon we have observed is that the methods based on weight vectors or reference points (i.e., MOEA/D, MOEA/DD, NSGA-III, and MOMBI-II) seem to lose their effectiveness on this test suite. This  can be attributed to the fact that the PFs of the WFG test suite are irregular, discontinued or mixed, and scaled with different ranges in each objective. Therefore, well-distributed weight vectors/reference points cannot guarantee a good distribution of the obtained solutions. Note, however, that RVEA, which also uses the reference vectors to guide the search, performs better than MOEA/D, MOEA/DD, NSGA-III, and MOMBI-II. This is perhaps because the use of angle information helps RVEA to alleviate this issue to a certain degree.</p><p>The HV values are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>, AnD and SPEA2+SDE achieve the best and second best overall performance, respectively. Specifically, AnD produces 14 best results and three second best results out of 27 test problems, and SPEA2+SDE has three best results and eight second best results. It is also observed that AnD reaches the best performance on WFG2, WFG4, WFG6, and WFG7.

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref>, and 35 test problems, respectively, but performs worse on 14, 14, five, eight, 11, 12, and four test problems. Thus, we can conclude that AnD is able to obtain better overall performance compared with the seven competitors in terms of both IGD and HV.</p><p>Furthermore, the Friedman test was also implemented on all the test problems in terms of both IGD and HV. In the Friedman test, the smaller the ranking, the better the performance of the algorithm. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref>, it is evident that AnD has the smallest ranking in terms of both IGD and HV, followed by RVEA and SPEA2+SDE. RVEA ranks the third and second best in terms of IGD and HV, respectively. SPEA2+SDE works the second and third best in terms of IGD and HV, respectively. Theses results indicate that the algorithm with either shift-based density estimation (i.e., SPEA2+SDE) or angle information (i.e., RVEA) is more suitable for solving MaOPs. Moreover, the algorithm with these two elements (i.e., AnD) achieves the best performance, which verifies the main motivation of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Constrained MaOPs</head><p>One may be interested in whether AnD can be applied to solve constrained MaOPs, which are frequently encountered in real-world applications. To answer this question, AnD was extended to cope with this kind of optimization problem, and the resultant algorithm is called C-AnD.</p><p>The constraint-handling technique of C-AnD is inspired by the feasibility rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which is a well-known constraint-handling technique for constrained single-objective optimization problems. Firstly, we compute the degree of constraint violation for each individual:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">CV (x) = J j=1 max{0, g j (x)} + K k=1 |h k (x)|. (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>where g j ≥ 0 and h j = 0 denote the jth inequality constraint and the jth equality constraint, respectively, and J and K are the number of inequality constraints and equality constraints, respectively. Subsequently, the number of feasible solutions  in the union population U t is calculated. If the number of feasible solutions is larger than N , then Algorithm 2 is triggered to select N feasible solutions for the next generation from all the feasible solutions. Otherwise, we sort the individuals in U t according to their degree of constraint violations, and then choose N individuals with the smallest degree of constraint violations for the next generation. Overall, the implementation of C-AnD is simple. The performance of C-AnD was compared with that of C-NSGA-III <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which is the constrained version of NSGA-III, on three representative constrained MaOPs, namely C1-DTLZ1, C2-DTLZ2, and C3-DTLZ4 with five, 10, and 15 objectives. Both C-AnD and C-NSGA-III were run 20 times independently for each test problem. In each run, the maximum number of FEs was set to 180,000 for C1-DTLZ1, and 90,000 for C2-DTLZ2 and C3-DTLZ4. The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>, it can be seen that C-AnD beats C-NSGA-III on all the test problems except C3-DTLZ4 with five objectives in terms of IGD. Therefore, C-AnD is also a simple and effective algorithm for constrained many-objective optimization. It is worth noting that there are no reference points in C-AnD; thus</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, an alternative algorithm for dealing with MaOPs, named AnD, has been proposed. AnD not only has a simple structure, but also is free from the use of the Pareto-dominance relation, weight vectors or reference points, and indicators. The main characteristic of AnD is that it makes use of two strategies (i.e., angle-based selection and shift-based density estimation) to delete poor individuals one by one during the environmental selection.</p><p>The aim of the angle-based selection strategy is to maintain the diversity of search directions. It identifies a pair of individuals with the minimum vector angle, which means that these two individuals search in the most similar directions. Subsequently, shift-based density estimation is conducted to differentiate them by considering both diversity and convergence, and to remove the inferior one. We validated that these two strategies play very important roles and are indispensable in AnD. In addition, we compared AnD with seven state-of-the-art MaOEAs for solving MaOPs with up to 15 objectives in the DTLZ and WFG test suites. The results indicate that, overall, AnD achieves the best performance in terms of both IGD and HV. AnD was further extended to solve constrained MaOPs and the results verify its effectiveness.</p><p>In the future, we will apply AnD to solve some unconstrained and constrained MaOPs in the fields of engineering, such as automotive lightweight design and adaptive walking of humanoid robots. Another promising research direction is to combine AnD with other kinds of MaOEAs, such as Pareto-based, decompositionbased, and indicator-based approaches.</p><p>The Matlab source code of AnD can be downloaded from Y.
