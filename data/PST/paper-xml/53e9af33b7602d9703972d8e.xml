<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Vesicles (also known as fluid membranes) are closed phospholipid membranes suspended in a viscous solution. They are found in biological systems, and play an important role in intracellular and intercellular transport. Artificial vesicles are used in a variety of drug-delivery systems and in the study biomembrane mechanics. Vesicle-inspired mechanical models can be used to approximate red blood cell mechanics. For example, at equilibrium (i.e., in a quiescent fluid), healthy red blood cells have a biconcave shape that corresponds to a minimal membrane bending energy. Under nonequilibrium conditions, as experienced in a simple shear flow, the best-studied features of red cell dynamics, formation of tank-treading ellipsoids and tumbling motion, are shared with vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</p><p>The vesicle evolution dynamics is characterized by a competition between membrane elastic energy, surface inextensibility, vanishing in-plane shear resistance, and non-local hydrodynamic interactions. Simulation of vesicles is a challenging nonlinear free boundary value problem, not amenable to analytical solutions in all but a few simple cases; numerical simulations and experiments are the only options for the quantitative characterization of vesicle flows.</p><p>In this paper, we present an algorithm for the simulation of general three-dimensional vesicle flows, extending our recent work on 2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> and 3D axisymmetric vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. (To demonstrate the capabilities of our code, we depict a few time-snapshots from a 20-vesicle simulation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.)</p><p>To establish notation, we start with the standard PDE formulation of the problem:</p><p>À Dv þ rp ¼ 0 in R 3 n c ðconservation of momentum in bulk fluidÞ; div v ¼ 0 in R 3 n c ðconservation of massÞ; div c v ¼ 0 on c ðsurface inextensibilityÞ;</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s À pn þ ðrv þ rv T Þnt ¼ f b þ f r</formula><p>on c ðbalance of momentum on the membraneÞ;</p><p>v À v 1 ! 0; if kxk ! 1 ðfar field conditionÞ; @x @t ¼ v on c ðmembrane material point motionÞ: In the first equation, v is the fluid velocity, p is the pressure, and c is the vesicle membrane. In the third equation, div c is the surface divergence operator. In the fourth equation, sqt denotes the jump of a quantity q across the vesicle membrane, n is the normal to the vesicle membrane, f b is a force due to bending resistance of the vesicle membrane, and f r is a force (tension) that enforces the surface inextensibility constraint. In the momentum balance equation, we assume that the mass of the membrane is negligible. In the last equation, x is the position of a material point on the membrane. In addition, the last equation encapsulates the fact that svt = 0 due to conservation of mass (normal direction) and the non-slip condition (tangent plane). A mathematically-equivalent formulation is based on a an explicit form of the solution of Stokes equation in the free space:</p><note type="other">ð1Þ</note><formula xml:id="formula_1">v ¼ v 1 þ S½f b þ f r on c; div c v ¼ 0 on c; @x @t ¼ v on c;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where S is the single-layer Stokes operator, defined in Section 3. The first equation encapsulates five equations of the PDE formulation: conservation of momentum in the bulk and on the membrane, conservation of mass, and the far-field boundary conditions for the fluid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Contributions</head><p>We extend the ideas presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> to the general case of vesicles in three dimensions. The main features of the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> are an integral equation formulation, spectral discretization in space, and a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, we described an extension of <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> to the axisymmetric case. There are several challenges specific to numerical simulation of non-axisymmetric vesicles flows in 3D: (i) What should the spatial discretization scheme be to maximize accuracy, computational efficiency, and numerical stability? (ii) Unlike 2D, using a Lagrangian frame of reference for spatial discretization of vesicle boundary results in extreme distortions, leading to numerical instability; how can this instability be controlled? (iii) Bending and tension forces in the 3D case have a more complex nonlinear form; can we design a timestepping scheme that addresses the severe stiffness while having similar per-time-step complexity to the explicit scheme (similar to our schemes for 2D and axisymmetric flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>)?</p><p>We summarize our contributions below.</p><p>We develop a high-order spatial discretization for inextensible vesicles based on spherical harmonics (Section 4), combining and extending a number of previously proposed techniques (see Section 2), including extending the quadrature scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> to the Stokes kernel (Section 4.1); We propose a particular linearization for a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme along with a preconditioning scheme (Section 5.3); We analyze the stiffness of Eq. (2) (Section 5) and use it to precondition the linear solves in the semi-implicit time scheme;</p><p>We propose a reparametrization scheme for stabilization of time-stepping, and analyze its accuracy and stability (Section 6); We verify the numerical scheme by comparing vesicle dynamics obtained with the proposed method against shapes obtained using our axisymmetric solver (which is based on an entirely different discretization scheme) (Section 7);</p><p>We present results on computing the equilibrium shapes of dilute suspension under shear flow, examine a two-vesicle interaction problem, study the sedimentation of a vesicle, and provide an example of a simulation with multiple vesicles (Section 7).</p><p>Synopsis of our method. Our method is based on Lagrangian tracking of spectral collocation points placed on the membrane of the vesicle combined with a surface reparametrization scheme. We achieve spectral accuracy in space by discretizing using spherical harmonics, which we use for the representation of the membrane and its spatial derivatives, for quadratures, and for antialising (Section 4). For weakly-singular integrals, we use the scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which enables high-accuracy simulations with a small (compared to low-order schemes) number of points per vesicle. For the position update in time, we use two variants of a semi-implicit marching scheme first derived for advection-diffusion equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and then applied on integral-equation based fluid-structure interaction problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>The time-marching scheme requires the solution a linear system of equations at each time step, which we perform using a Krylov iterative method (GMRES <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>). The problem of poor conditioning is addressed by a preconditioner based on the analytically obtained spectrum of the operators in (2) for the special case of a unit sphere. Vesicle-vesicle interactions can be carried out using the kernel independent fast multipole method <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. In this paper, we focus on the mathematical formulation and not on performance and parallelization. We report, preliminary results on a high-performance parallel implementation of this method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>In all, we are able to achieve high accuracy while using a small number of unknowns per vesicle for the spatial discretization and taking large time steps with a relatively low computational cost per time step.</p><p>Pseudocode that summarizes the scheme can be found in Section 5.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Limitations</head><p>We restrict our attention to suspensions of vesicles in fluids with unbounded domains. We have ignored inertial terms, so the overall method is restricted to low Reynolds numbers. We only consider spherical-topology vesicles and we do not allow for topological changes, which are present in many biophysical phenomena involving vesicles.</p><p>In our examples, we assume that the interior and exterior of the vesicles are filled with the same liquid. The algorithm extends to the case of viscosity contrast with the introduction of double layer potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Additional convolution with a stresslet is required which can be computed using the singular quadrature rule described in this paper. The detailed algorithm for two-dimensional flow can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, in which in addition to viscosity contrast we introduce confined flows with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The formulation for the three dimensional case is similar. We will report the extension in future work.</p><p>An important limitation of our scheme is the lack of adaptivity (both in space and time). This lack of adaptivity can cause vesicle-vesicle collisions, which are not possible in the mathematical model we use. Indeed, one can easily construct simulations where without a significant increase of the surface discretization size, our code fails to resolve inter-vesicle interactions accurately. This is an open problem and we are currently working on addressing this issue.</p><p>We have also observed a dependence of the stable time step size on the shear rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Outline of the paper</head><p>In the next section, we review the related work on numerical methods for vesicle flows. In Section 3, we present the overall integral equation formulation. In Sections 4 and 5, we present the spatial and temporal discretization schemes respectively. In Section 6, we discuss the reparametrization scheme and we conclude in Section 7 with results from numerical experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>Several of the algorithmic components of the proposed method have appeared in the literature. A few closely related papers are our work on 2D and 3D axisymmetric flows ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>), Graham and Sloan's singular quadratures (for the scalar Helmholtz operator, but are directly applicable to our case) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Zinchenko and Davis' surface reparametrization schemes for drops and deformable particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, and the very recent work of Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> on boundary integral equation based simulations of red blood cells in shear flow, presenting a spherical harmonic discretization of membranes with bending and shear resistance and and explicit time discretization for particulate flows of this type. We discuss these papers in more detail below. To our knowledge, there is no prior work on implicit or semi-implicit schemes for locally inextensible vesicles in three dimensions.</p><p>We focus our discussion of related work on three-dimensional numerical methods; we do not attempt to perform a comprehensive review of experimental and numerical studies of vesicle flows.</p><p>Three-dimensional vesicle flows. Stokesian particulate flow problems are solved using a variety of methods, including unstructured finite element methods and Cartesian grids (immersed boundary/interface, fictitious domain, phase-field and level sets). For a brief review of these methods, in comparison with integral equation formulations, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Several groups have considered stationary shapes of three-dimensional vesicles using semi-analytic <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, or numerical methods like the phase-field <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and finite element methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. These approaches are based on a constrained variational approach (i.e., minimizing the bending energy subject to area and volume constraints) and have not been used for resolving fluid-structure interactions.</p><p>We restrict our discussion to integral equation formulations, which, for certain classes of problems, offer certain computational advantages compared to stencil-based methodologies (finite differences or finite elements). Pozrikidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> reviews the work on boundary integral formulations for particulate flows prior to 2000.</p><p>The main features of an integral-equation vesicle flow solver are the underlying formulation (direct vs indirect), the discretization of the surface, the quadrature scheme, and the time-stepping scheme. For Lagrangian vesicle surface discretization, a form of adapting the sampling of the surface to the deformed shape (reparametrization) is needed. To our knowledge the majority of particulate flow solvers in three dimensions use explicit schemes <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> with the exception of the work of Dimitrakopoulos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In that work, a Jacobian-free, finite-difference based Newton method was used. Despite its good convergence, the cost per iteration is somewhat higher than our approach as the method requires multiple evaluations for each matrix-vector multiplication and no preconditioning was used. We discuss the related work for each of the other features in more detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integral equation formulation.</head><p>Several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> have used direct integral equation formulation for simulating vesicle flows. This formulation results in a single-layer potential for flows with no viscosity contrast and a combination of a single-layer and a double-layer for flows with viscosity contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. A particular feature of vesicle flows is the local surface inextensibility constraint. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref> the constraint is treated by a penalty formulation. The penalty parameter results in artificial stiffness and a loss in accuracy in enforcing the constraint. Imposing the constraint using a Lagrange multiplier removes the stiffness and resolves the inextensibility constraint with spectral accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.</p><p>Surface discretization. In particulate flows, the surface is typically represented by a triangulation. Once such triangulation is available, either collocation or Galerkin schemes can be used to discretize the integral equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Examples include <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. High-order B-spline methods were used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Pozrikidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposes a boundary element scheme for deformable capsules with bending and in-plane shear resistance based on six-node quadratically curved triangles and a low-order accurate integration method. This discretization requires tracking of 1026 points per surface to get 0.01% error in the total volume of the particle. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> Spherical harmonics have been used frequently in boundary integral equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It enables spectrally accurate integration and differentiation. Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> uses a spherical harmonic discretization for deformable capsules with bending and shear resistance, but no inextensibility constraint. Singular quadratures. Bruno and Kunyansky <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a spectral integration scheme for weakly-singular integrals. Ying et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> extended it to arbitrary-geometry smooth surfaces. Although asymptotically optimal, this scheme is rather expensive as it requires the use of partition of unity functions, for which derivative magnitudes rapidly increase with order and as a consequence, a relatively large number of points is needed for good approximation. This scheme is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. To reduce the discretization size without compromising accuracy, we use the scheme proposed by Graham and Sloan <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. It is only applicable on smooth surfaces of genus zero but it is quite fast. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, the schemes of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> are compared and it is shown that the latter scheme is more accurate for small numbers of discretization points.</p><p>Simulation of concentrated suspensions of vesicles requires evaluation of nearly-singular integrals. Although we could use the integration scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, we have found that, for the problem sizes we are targeting, it is cheaper to use a simple upsampling-based quadrature (see discussion in Section 4.1).</p><p>Reparametrization. In the context of deformable surfaces, the need and methods for maintaining grid quality is ubiquitous. All the resampling methods known to us in this context focus on mesh-based surface representations (primarily piecewiselinear, but also higher-order, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>) and we are not aware of any methods designed for spectral discretizations.</p><p>Many approaches are based on various types of tangential mesh smoothing, often combined with connectivity adaptation. For simulation of multiple interacting drops, Loewenberg and Hinch <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> proposed a heuristic formula for artificial tangential velocity reducing mesh distortion. Zinchenko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> observed that the technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> leads to instabilities in simulations with gravity induced motions, and constructed a tangential velocity field by global minimization of the sum of squares of the rates of change of the distances between adjacent vertices (tangency of the field is enforced as a constraint), the first instance of the passive stabilization approach. This method was further developed by introducing different objectives for minimization in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>, which adapted the sampling density to curvature and controlled triangle quality. A simpler version of passive stabilization suitable for moderate deformations was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, including a distancepreserving term, and a triangle ''compactness'' term penalizing elongated triangles. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> the same simplified energy is supplemented by node redistribution, aiming to equalize mesh edge lengths. A modification of this method reducing maximal deviation from average is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. In Cristini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> a damped relaxation with the energy gradient projected to the surface is used. Additionally, nodes are added by triangle quadrisection (also to minimize the energy) and removed by edge collapse.</p><p>An advancing-front method for remeshing of quadratic triangular elements (originally proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>) adapting triangle size to local criteria such as curvature is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and is extended in a number subsequent papers to surfaces, in particular in Lohner <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Tryggvason et al. [60]</ref> briefly describe an algorithm for adapting a mesh to an evolving fluid interface, which uses edge length as a criterion for bisection and edge collapses to remove small elements.</p><p>A set of algorithms for anisotropic mesh adaptation, including anisotropic smoothing, applicable to the problem of approximating deforming surfaces, was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Feng and Klug <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> use subdivision finite elements, and demonstrate that local inextensibility combined with a sufficiently accurate Galerkin method makes it possible to simulate moderate deformations with fluid membranes (without fluid interaction). Ma and Klug <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> mention that local inextensibility combined with large deformations still leads to instability, and describe how viscous stabilization of the mesh can be achieved by minimizing an energy measuring the deviation of edge length from previous values. This approach is suitable for computing equilibrium shapes in the absence of external forces, but not for dynamic simulations.</p><p>Aliasing errors. While various nonlinear quantities (e.g., surface mean curvature and its derivatives used for forces) can be evaluated accurately pointwise, they may contain high frequencies which cannot be resolved properly with a small number of sampling points, leading to aliasing errors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>), i.e., discretization errors that can be resolved by increasing the resolution. In our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, in two dimensions 64 points were sufficient to resolve the vesicle interactions and aliasing was not an issue. In three dimensions, however, we need to consider aliasing errors for two reasons: first, we would like to enable accurate simulations with very few spectral collocation points (say 98 points) to allow simulations with very large number of vesicles. In this regime, filtering is required to deal with unresolved frequencies. Second, unlike capsules endowed with strong shear resistance, vesicles are fluid membranes and as a result they experience excessive deformations that lead to significant amplification of aliasing errors. The latter cannot be addressed with simple linear filtering. Nonlinear reparametrization schemes are required. We present one such scheme in this paper tailored for spectral discretizations.</p></div>

For instance, the mean curvature, H(x), of a smooth surface is a smooth function which can be computed at sample locations from the derivatives of x (see Appendix D). However, even if x is bandlimited and exactly representable with the expansion of order p, this could no longer be true for the mean curvature, and its reconstruction from the values at sample points used for x suffers from aliasing. To reduce these errors, we upsample x using spherical harmonics interpolation, perform differentiation, filter out the high-frequency components and then restrict the result to the original grid. The required upsampling order depends on the surface and also the differentiation order and p (for high-enough p, both x and H are resolved and no filtering is necessary). In our numerical experiments, we found that upsampling to a resolution two times higher than the original grid works well. We demonstrate one such experiment in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Singular integration</head><p>For integrals involving the weakly singular Stokes kernel, we use a superalgebraically convergent integration scheme. There are many techniques that can be used to resolve the singularity accurately. As discussed in the introduction, our main goal in choosing the quadrature scheme is to achieve spectral accuracy while maintaining good computational efficiency for small values of p (p = 8-32). For smooth surfaces that admit global parametrization, there are two main approaches to singular integration: one proposed by Bruno and Kunyansky <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> based on partitions of unity and the other proposed by Graham and Sloan <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> based on rotations and special quadratures. The former scheme has better asymptotic complexity Oðp 3 Þ as opposed to the Oðp 5 Þ of the latter. However, for the values of p that are of interest to us (p 6 48), the Graham-Sloan scheme performs much better <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>: multiplication by the partition of unity used in the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> results in substantial increase in the integrand derivative magnitudes resulting in lower accuracy for a given number of samples.

Therefore, applying the Gaussian quadrature along u-direction (as opposed to Theorem 4.1 which applies Gaussian quadrature in t-direction where t = cos u) and the trapezoidal rule along v-direction yields spectral convergence. However, the errors for a specific p would be slightly higher using this scheme compared to the scheme described in Theorem 4.2. The reason for this is the clustering of the sampling points near the poles, which results in less accurate approximations for a fixed p.</p><p>A significant part of the overall complexity of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">20</ref>) is due to the rotation of the coordinate system needed for every evaluation point on the vesicle surface.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Reparameterization</head><p>When membrane shear elasticity is present, as for example in Neo-Hookean constitutive laws (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>), there is a builtin mechanism that prevents material points on the membrane from clustering together. The local surface inextensibility of vesicles prevents the extreme deformations that can be observed in drops. Nevertheless, the lack of in-plane shear resistance causes significant distortions of the point distribution, which in turn introduces unresolvable high-frequency components, excessive aliasing errors, and numerical instability (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). To address these errors and enable long-time accurate simulations using a small number of spherical harmonics coefficients, we reparametrize the surface at each time step through a redistribution of points that seeks to minimize the high-frequency component of the spherical harmonics expansion of the surface parametrization. Unlike previous work, this antialiasing is nonlinear: it is not done by a linear spectral projection but by solving a nonlinear variational problem.</p><p>We define the surface c as the image of an embedding of the sphere xðqÞ : S 2 !

Many different embeddings correspond to the same surface, and our goal is to chose one that minimizes a quality measure EðxÞ : X ! R.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Results</head><p>In this section, we study the accuracy, stability and complexity of our computational scheme through numerical experiments. In particular, we test (1) the accuracy of the high-order derivatives calculation (curvature) (Section 4), (2) the accuracy of the smooth, the weakly-singular, and the nearly-singular quadratures (Section 4.1), (3) the need for and effects of reparametrization (Section 6), and (4) the time-marching stability properties of the explicit and semi-implicit schemes (Section 5). In addition to verifying our method, we also present results on the relaxation shapes of dilute suspension under shear flow, examine a two-vesicle interaction problem, study the sedimentation of a vesicle, and provide an example of a simulation with multiple vesicles.</p><p>First, we define the length and time scales for the different flow regimes we consider in our experiments.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">13</ref>) for differentiation; in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we report the relative errors in computing the Gaussian curvature K, and the mean curvature H of this surface. The errors decay super-algebraically with p. However, for higher values of p, the round-off errors dominate and the relative errors start to grow as Oðp 2 Þ where is the machine precision. This behavior is typical for spectral methods<ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">11</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In the axisymmetric case <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, we advocated differentiating non-bandlimited functions as frugally as possible. This approach abates the round-off error growth to some extent. Another promising approach is proposed recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> based on expressing high-order derivatives as Cauchy integrals over circular contours. We will investigate the effectiveness of these schemes in the present context and report the results at a later date. Accuracy of the numerical integration schemes. Our singular integral evaluation scheme outlined in Section 4 is spectrally accurate. Other popular spectral method is the floating partition of unity scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Because of the steep gradients in the partition of unity functions, this scheme loses a few digits of accuracy. Our scheme, on the other hand, computes singular integrals as accurately as smooth integrals. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for a comparison of those two schemes.</p><p>We report the convergence results for the smooth and singular integral computation schemes in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>. We can observe that the singular integrals are computed with nearly the same order of accuracy as the smooth integrals (compare, for instance, the harmonic potential and area computations). Consequently, using very few spatial discretization points, we are able capture the essential vesicle dynamics. We show one such example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>.</p><p>Reparametrization. To verify the effectiveness of the reparametrization, let us consider a single vesicle in a shear flow. Let the bending modulus of the vesicle j = 1e À 2, the shear rate v = 15, and the time horizon T = 0.6. In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(a) we show the  configuration of the vesicle at different time steps for two test cases. The top vesicle snapshots correspond to the case when we perform reparametrization, and the bottom set of snapshots is without reparametrization. As we can see in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(b), the energy of the surface remains bounded when we use reparametrization. In its absence, as soon as the vesicle starts tanktreading, the energy blows up. Note that the need for maintaining the grid quality is not limited to the case when the vesicle undergoes tank-treading motion. As reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, even in the case of axisymmetric gravity-induced motions of deformable drops, the Lagrangian points cluster at the tail of a drop. Moreover, a simple elimination of the tangential component of the velocity, that is, updating the positions using the normal velocity (u Á n)n, suffers from similar mesh degradations <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>.</p><p>Stability of the time-marching scheme. We compare the stability constraints of the explicit and the semi-implicit schemes in simulating the motion of a vesicle suspended in simple shear flow (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). The initial shape of the vesicle is given by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_58">40</ref>) in which we take qðu; vÞ ¼ 1 þ Y 0 2 ðu; vÞ. We computed the stable time-step size Dt using the bisection method: starting from an arbitrary large time step we reduce it by half until the simulation is stable within a predefined time horizon. For this experiment, we have chosen the time horizon long enough so that the vesicle reaches its equilibrium shape in shear flow. Here we plot the l 2 norm of the spherical harmonics coefficients of the surface (for the case of p = 12) vs. time for different filtering frequencies, which are denoted by q, The trend of all plots for q &gt; 6 is similar to that of q = 12 and, for the sake of clarity, those cases are omitted from the plot.  The stable time steps are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref> as a function of the shear rate and the spatial resolution p. The explicit scheme has two shortcomings: (i) for a fixed p,Dt decreases as v is increased, (ii) for a fixed v and low shear rates, Dt decreases dramatically as p is increased. We can explain these constraints as follows. Embedding the tension force and the constraint equation in a projection operator P, we can write the non-dimensionalised evolution equation as</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">_ x ¼ P v x 3 0 0 2 6 4 3 7 5 þ S½ÀðD S H þ 2HðH 2 À KÞÞn 0 B @ 1 C A;<label>ð41Þ</label></formula><p>where P acts on a surface velocity field and eliminates the extensible component. We can easily verify that P is a well-conditioned operator using the spectral analysis of Section 3. It does not contribute to the stiffness. Only the second term within brackets in (41) induces high-order stiffness. Now consider two extreme cases. When v = 0, the evolution equation is stiff and for this reason we observe a stringent restriction on the time-step. On the other hand, when v is high, the first term dominates and it attenuates the stiffness arising from the second term. For this reason, the CFL appears to be milder for v = The semi-implicit scheme suffers only from the first constraint and its stable time-step size is inversely proportional to v.</p><p>But it does not suffer from CFL constraint. Hence, it allows much larger time steps, particularly for low shear rates, compared to the explicit scheme. We have performed additional simulations, reported in Figs. 10, 9 and 1 in which we have observed the spatial-resolution independence of the time step. In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> we summarize the equilibrium shapes of vesicles in shear flow for different reduced volumes and shear rates.</p><p>Simulations in presence of gravity.

We observe that without reparametrization, at t % 60Dt, the surface becomes highly distorted and the method diverges. Experimentally, the blow-up starts as soon as the vesicle begins to tank-tread.
